Watch Women’s March Activist: ‘Missing Black Girls” Connected to Trump Tax Returns,"Unbelievable! Women s March Activist went off on a crazy rant claiming that somehow President Trump s tax returns are linked to missing black girls in the U.S.:Transcript: to lock arms with one another. We demand that we see Trump s taxes while we also demand that all of our rights are protected. We demand that we see Trump s taxes while we also demand that women s rights be treated as human rights. We must speak with one voice and one accord and we must draw a direct line between Trump s taxes and missing girls, missing black girls all across this country.We must say that while we resist one, we resist all or else our fight is inauthentic. We must say Trump s taxes and equal education. We must say Trump s taxes no more police brutality. We must say that Trump s taxes is where we start today but we will not end there.

Bitter John McCain Calls Trump ‘Ill Informed’ in Nasty OpEd: ‘We don’t answer to him’,"What the heck! Senator John McCain just admitted that he doesn t answer to President Trump! Can you imagine if a Senator had done this to Obama? McCain s OpEd in The Washington Post is a horrible hit on Trump. Shame on him!It starts out with a statement about how horrible the white supremacists are and then goes on to discuss Congress getting back to order. It s a snoozer of an OpEd until you get to the last part In a shocking slam on President Trump s character and knowledge of government, McCain shows his bitterness towards Trump. He claims that,  We don t answer to him   but also say that,  We must respect his authority WTH!MCCAIN: IT S TIME CONGRESS RETURNS TO REGULAR ORDER: We can fight like hell for our ideas to prevail. But we have to respect each other or at least respect the fact that we need each other.That has never been truer than today, when Congress must govern with a president who has no experience of public office, is often poorly informed and can be impulsive in his speech and conduct.We must respect his authority and constitutional responsibilities. We must, where we can, cooperate with him. But we are not his subordinates. We don t answer to him. We answer to the American people. We must be diligent in discharging our responsibility to serve as a check on his power. And we should value our identity as members of Congress more than our partisan affiliation.I argued during the health-care debate for a return to regular order, letting committees of jurisdiction do the principal work of crafting legislation and letting the full Senate debate and amend their efforts.We won t settle all our differences that way, but such an approach is more likely to make progress on the central problems confronting our constituents. We might not like the compromises regular order requires, but we can and must live with them if we are to find real and lasting solutions. And all of us in Congress have the duty, in this sharply polarized atmosphere, to defend the necessity of compromise before the American public.SEE WHAT HE DID THERE? He basically said our president is clueless and impulsive so we don t need to listen to him. Unreal! Is McCain bitter and trying to get back at Trump? It s unheard of for a sitting Senator of the party in power trashes the president that is from the same party!

Muslim Activist Caught Sending Donations to Left-Wing PAC by Disguising it as Hurricane Relief,"This woman has no shame1 Muslim activist Linda Sarsour (remember the fake women s march?) has been caught sending money meant for hurricane relief to a lefty political PAC. She tweeted out about it and was hammered on twitter for twisting the truth:Texas Organizing Project is not my PAC, but who cares about facts when you are white supremacists obsessed w/ smearing women of color.   https://t.co/MsY3lAwbLs  Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) August 31, 2017The denial was a Clintonian twist on words. This woman pulls the race card when confronted with her crime?Just in case you haven t heard of Sarsour:Approximately 200,000 people participated in a  Women s March  in D.C. on Saturday. One of the organizers of the march, Linda Sarsour is a Pro-Palestine Muslim activist.She also advocates for Sharia Law in America and has ties to terrorist organization, Hamas.Linda Sarsour, one of the organizers behind Saturday s Women s March, being held in Washington, D.C., was recently spotted at a large Muslim convention in Chicago posing for pictures with an accused financier for Hamas, the terrorist group.Sarsour, the head of the Arab American Association of New York and an Obama White House  Champion of Change,  was speaking at last month s 15th annual convention of the Muslim American Society and Islamic Circle of North America.While there, she posed for a picture with Salah Sarsour, a member of the Islamic Society of Milwaukee and former Hamas operative who was jailed in Israel in the 1990s because of his alleged work for the terrorist group.Though she avoids discussing it now, Sarsour has acknowledged in past interviews that she has cousins serving prison time in Israel because of their work for Hamas.Sarsour has denied having any contact with the terror group. She told The New York Times in 2012 that she would not have been appointed an Obama  Champion of Change  if she had.The activist has risen to national attention recently. She served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, and she is one of four lead organizers for the Women s March.  Daily CallerThe fact that an Islamic faction was one of the organizers of the Women s March is laughable at best. Islam is responsible for the worst abuses of women and children not only throughout history, but at present day. Islamic supremacists who wish to impose Sharia law in America have infiltrated various leftist movements in order to appear as an oppressed minority.

DISGUSTING: CLEVELAND COPS JOIN Hate Group Who Inspired Multiple Murders Of Fellow Officers To Disrespect Our Flag,"Black Lives Matter, the group that many believe is a  hate group or domestic terror group  has inspired a wave of professional athletes to join in the disrespect our flag by taking a knee during our national anthem. Unbelievably, this cop-hating group has now found an unlikely ally in their fight against cops, Cleveland, OH law enforcement officers. How politically correct Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco quarterback, became the poster child for cop hate when he refused to stand for our national anthem prior to the start of the NFL games. Kaepernick used his display of disrespect for our flag to show his disrespect for our law enforcement. Kaepernick was not resigned by SF and did not receive another offer to play in the NFL. He is now the center of a huge controversy, as the NAACP has joined forces with BLM to demand that an NFL owner pick up the lackluster and controversial QB.The Cleveland Brown players have been known to display their over-the-top hate for law enforcement before. After Beyonce s racist halftime Super Bowl 2016 show, Cleveland Browns running back Isaiah Crowell posted this disgusting image on his Instagram account:Crowell apologized for posting the ISIS-like image of a police officer being decapitated, and all was forgiven Meanwhile, the Cleveland Browns have decided to turn up the disrespect for our flag a notch. Several players are now taking a knee while the rest of the fans and players stand to honor our flag and our nation.The veterans in Cleveland are tired of watching the nation and flag they fought for being disrespected by these clowns who have never sacrificed a moment of their lives for our country. They posted this sign in front of their building to show the disrespectful Cleveland Brown players how they feel about their behavior:And now, in the most disgusting act of pandering to political correctness, the Cleveland Police officers have decided they will join the cop-hating group to disrespect our flag:Cleveland officers and EMS back out of plan to hold American flag on Browns  field after 12 players refused to stand for anthem pic.twitter.com/HD5Jt9LDGT  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) September 1, 2017",politics,"Sep 1, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

LOL! Shelia Jackson Lee Declares that Houston is 50′ Below Sea Level [Video],"Congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee joined Roland Martin to talk about the devastation left from Hurricane Harvey. To get a picture of what s happening in Houston the congresswoman tried to explain at the 2:20 mark that,  Many people don t know that we are 50 feet below sea level and are still flooding.  HUH??? WHAAAAT???? Yes, she opened her mouth and removed all doubt she s clueless!FACTS: SEA LEVEL = HOUSTON: Downtown Houston stands about 50 feet (15 m) above sea level, and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about 125 feet (38 m) in elevation. Land along the Texas Gulf Coast is sinking at the rate of about 2 inches per decade, which may not seem like much.DON T FORGET THAT RACE CARD: 3:45 Martin starts to talk about the  black folks Is the storm racist now?Jackson Lee and Martin went on to pull out that race card: Houston neighborhoods have been hit, but a majority of them have been African American neighborhoods that are underwater.  That s where we keep going back to,   explained Lee.As of now, Congresswoman Lee wants to,  Make sure the President complies and keeps the promises that he made.

(FOX59)   Parents of students at an Indiana elementary school are not happy after a first grade teacher sent home a note asking children not to talk about God, Jesus, or the Devil, FOX 59 reports.According to a statement from McCordsville Elementary School, a debate about God happened in the first grade classroom earlier in the week, so the teacher sent the letter about her expectations to parents. The section of the letter reportedly asked parents to have a talk with their children about the time and place to discuss faith.A parent submitted the letter to FOX 59, which in part reads:  With Mccordsville Elementary being a public school, we have many different religions and beliefs, and I do not want to upset a child or parent because of these words being used. A letter from the superintendent said it is okay for students to speak about their religion as long as it does not interrupt class:  Trying to limit a student s view on religion is a violation of a student s first amendment rights. However, if the discussion becomes an academic disruption, then as a district, we can intervene to maintain the integrity of the educational process while at the same time being sure to not violate a student s constitutional rights.

America’s ‘Hottest’ Conservative Joins Fox News Team,"Tomi Lahren recently told The Hollywood Reporter that news networks need to hire more conservatives as commentators:  It seems as though the only diversity some networks won t embrace is diversity of opinion Well, FOX News just hired Lahren as a contributor.

She gained a following via Facebook and is unconventional in her rise to news notoriety.

DISCOVERED: FORMER PAKISTANI-BORN MUSLIM IT AIDE Under Investigation By FBI For Stealing Data From Congress Has ACTIVE House Email Account TIED TO MUSLIM US Rep André Carson,"A former IT aide suspected of stealing equipment and data from Congress still has an active, secret email account on the House computer system, even though he has been banned from the congressional network because of a criminal investigation into the alleged cybersecurity violations, The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group has learned.Imran Awan s still-active email address is linked to the name of a House staffer who specializes in intelligence and homeland security matters for Indiana Democratic Rep. Andr  Carson. Court documents and emails obtained by TheDCNF show Awan used the address 123@mail.house.gov in addition to his standard imran.awan@mail.house.gov account.He and two of his Pakistani-born brothers, as well as his wife, are at the center of an FBI investigation over their IT work with dozens of Democratic congressional offices. Authorities shut down Awan s standard email account Feb. 2, and he was arrested by the FBI at Dulles International Airport trying to board a flight to his native Pakistan on July 25.Authorities apparently did not realize Awan has a second account that is not linked to his identity. While his main email address began rejecting mail after it was shut down, the 123 address was still accepting mail Tuesday.Mail sent via Gmail fills in the name of the account-holder of 123 as Nathan Bennett, whose LinkedIn profile says his individual legislative portfolio covers  national security and foreign affairs  and includes work on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.The member Bennett works for, Andre Carson is a member of both the House Intelligence and House Homeland Security Committees, and previously employed Awan.Carson is ranking member of the House intelligence subcommittee on emerging threats, which oversees the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The subcommittee oversight extends to the National Counterterrorism Center and information-sharing programs. For entire story: Daily Caller So who is US Rep. Andre Carson, and why should we be concerned about the Pakistani born Muslim IT Aide hired by the former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz? Andre Carson is one of only two Muslims serving in Congress. The other is Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who became the first Muslim elected to Congress in 2006. Andre Carson has openly stated that American schools should be modeled after Islamic Madrassas. America will never tap into educational innovation and ingenuity without looking at the model that we have in our madrassas, in our schools, where innovation is encouraged, where the foundation is the Quran. And that model that we are pushing in some of our schools meets the multiple needs of students. Watch at the 6:25 mark:Shoebat- The next time the American people are told by a U.S. member of Congress that they can t know something because it is  classified  or  still under investigation , they should point their collective finger directly at one man   Andre Carson. The reason is that Carson is not just one of the only two Muslim members of Congress; he is now a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), appointed by House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).If ever there was a committee that has been able to hide behind the claim that it can t answer a question because that answer would reveal classified information, HPSCI is such a committee.The problem isn t solely that Carson is a Muslim. It s also that he s accepted contributions from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and is tied to other Muslim Brotherhood front groups. CAIR was an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation (HLF) trial, which actually represents an additional problem. That problem is that it reveals another extremely fundamental flaw in the Bill Clinton strategy of treating acts of terrorism as criminal acts instead of as acts of war.

He also offered his support and encouragement to the players.G.W. stood in the middle of the field and spoke to the players and coaches, as he tried to reassure them that they would recover: I know there s some people from Houston here, and the Houston area. And I know you re going through a really tough time. And just know that there ll be a lot of people that are gonna help, help the people down there a lot. The country, right now, they re recovering, and so the key thing on the recovery is to keep people safe. And then it s gonna be the rebuilding. And if you re from that area, you d be amazed at all the people who come down there to help all kinds of people. And so, the days are dark now, but they re gonna get better.

LOL! WATCH DEMOCRAT DINGBAT Sheila Jackson Lee Repeatedly Confuse “Hurricane Sandy” With “Sandy Hook”,"CNN s Allison Camerota started out her interview with Democrat Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee telling her that it was being pointed out that,  A whole bunch of Texas lawmakers voted against sending financial aid to the victims of Superstorm Sandy when they needed it in 2012 and 2013. Why didn t you vote at that time to help Sandy victims?   Camerota asked. Well, at the time, we helped Sandy victims. The Democrats wanted more money. We didn t get all the money we needed. Frankly, um we did vote. I did vote on the maximum money. Unfortunately, it did not pass. Why didn t you vote for H.R. 152, that was the Appropriations Act of 2013, that all sorts of Texas lawmakers voted against and you just did not vote? Why did you skip that one? As I said, I voted on legislation to help the Sandy Hook victims,  Jackson Lee responded. Camerota corrected her, Sandy superstorm, At the conclusion of the interview,  Allison Camerota took the time to clarify that Just so that we re clear, we re talking about  Superstorm Sandy, not the Sandy Hook shooting.Immediately following Camerota s clairification, Jackson Lee clarified that yes, she is complete bafoon, as she ended the interview by clarifying that she was indeed talking about the mass murder of small children in New Jersey vs. the superstorm:  Let me be clear, I voted on many votes for Sandy Hook funding. Another reporter attempted to point out that Repbulican Senator Ted Cruz voted aginst a $50 billion bill that was supposedly intended to help Sandy Superstorm victims. Unlike dingbat Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, Senator Cruz offered a legitimate reason for not supporting the bill that was filled with pork by legislators who weren t acting in the best interest of Sandy Superstorm victims. The accurate thing to say is that I and a number of others enthusiastically and emphatically supported hurricane relief for Sandy,  the senator told the MSNBC host.  The problem with that particular bill is it became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork it s not right for politicians to exploit a disaster when people are hurting to pay for their own political wish list.

WOW! Rebel Media Finds Shocking Evidence Implicating Son of DEM APPOINTED Judge In “Hate Crime” Trump Supporter Was FALSELY Charged With [VIDEO],"Rebel Media: Attacking someone for their politics could be expected from private citizens acting out against each other, but what about government and law enforcement officials?The Rebel has investigated the case of Mark Feigin, a California Trump supporter who was wrongfully accused of and charged with an anti-Muslim hate crime.On October 19, 2016, Feigin was arrested and charged with making a  criminal threat  and  annoying phone calls  against the Islamic Center of Southern California by the Los Angeles Police Department, and then by California Attorney General Kamala Harris.LAPD officers accused Feigin of making two threatening phone calls and claimed that they had traced the phone calls back to him, later labeling the calls a hate crime against Muslims.On October 19th, 2016, Feigin s home was raided by the LAPD and his weapons were confiscated and placed on display for the media during a press conference where the California Media and LAPD were complicit in portraying Feigin as a potential mass murderer.Cmdr. Horace Frank with the Los Angeles Police Department stated in a press conference in October 2016: The male caller threatened to kill the person who answered the phone along with other members of the center because of the caller s hatred for Muslims and his belief that Muslims will destroy the United States. The Rebel has obtained new documents and evidence through police disclosure surrounding the case which proves that the first phone call made to the Islamic Center came from the phone of a different California man, Michael Slawson.Michael Slawson is the son of Democratically appointed Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Slawson.In other words, Slawson s father is a judge in the same justice system under which Feigin was charged.",politics,"Aug 29, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
President Trump’s Extreme Vetting Takes the Next Step…But Is It Enough?,"Will the new policy for face-to-face interviews with applicants for citizenship be enough to weed out terrorists who only plan on harming Americans?It s being reported that many seeking citizenship and asylum have converted to Christianity to better their chances of making it into their desired country:Breitbart News reported:Muslims migrating from Syria have admitted to converting to Christianity in a bid to boost their chances of being given asylum in the West, despite the risks associated with apostasy. Two Muslim Syrians living in Lebanon have told The Telegraph that they and their families have converted to Christianity because they believe it gives them a better chance of gaining asylum in the West, and because they can better access aid from Christian charities.Ibrahim Ali, who became homeless after moving to Beirut, told the paper:  A lot of people are doing it to get to Europe, the US and Canada. While I plan to stay in Lebanon, I know hundreds who been baptised just to help their applications. They would do anything to have security for their family. The Department of Homeland Security announced Monday that it will soon require more people to undergo in-person interviews before they can gain a firmer legal footing in the U.S., carrying out yet another part of President Trump s extreme vetting executive order.While the so-called travel ban on six Muslim-majority countries has garnered most of the attention, it was just a temporary measure designed to give the government the space to stiffen its regular checks so it could be more adept at denying potential terrorists entry.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced one of those new policies Monday, saying it wants more people to have to face in-person interviews before they re giving permanent status in the country.

"ONE BEER COMPANY Praised For Shutting Down Business To Help Texas Flood Victims, While Popular Pastor Joel Osteen Gets SLAMMED For Keeping Megachurch Doors Shut To Flood Victims","The Anheuser-Busch Brewery put beer production on hold this week, instead of canning safe drinking water to distribute to flooding victims affected by Hurricane Harvey.More than 50,000 cans of emergency drinking water will be sent from the brewing company s factory in Cartersville, Ga., a spokesperson for Anheuser-Busch said to FOX5.The water will be distributed at Red Cross shelters in Baton Rouge, La., where Flash Flood Watch is in effect through Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. Throughout the year, we periodically pause beer production at our Cartersville, Ga., brewery to produce emergency canned drinking water so we are ready to help out communities across the country in times of crisis,  said Sarah Schilling, brewmaster at the Anheuser-Busch brewery in a statement. Putting our production and logistics strengths to work by providing safe, clean drinking water is the best way we can help in these situations,  she said.   FOX NewsMeanwhile, Joel Osteen, the pastor of the Lakewood megachurch in Houston, TX, is being hammered on social for keeping the doors to his church closed to victims of the worst recorded flood in Houston s history. Osteen s net worth is valued at over $40 million. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Joel Osteen tweeted to his followers:Victoria & I are praying for everyone affected by Hurricane Harvey. Please join us as we pray for the safety of our Texas friends & family.  Joel Osteen (@JoelOsteen) August 26, 2017Apparently, many folks on Twitter didn t feel as though the pastor, who also happens to be mega-rich, is doing enough to help the people who have supported his luxury lifestyle for years.One Twitter user published photos that were allegedly taken in the parking lot of the Lakewood megachurch following the massive flooding. If these pictures are indeed accurate, the Lakewood church appears to be unaffected by the flooding.UPDATE: Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church in Houston IS accessible.

Wow! Sheriff Joe Arpaio Considering Running Against This Unpopular Arizona Senator,"What a great idea! Sheriff Joe Arpaio is considering a run against unpopular Senator Jeff Flake He s got lots of support from the people of Arizona after serving as Maricopa County sheriff for 24 years. He d be a straight shooting senator, if elected. He would also be on board with the Trump Train unlike Jeff Flake.We think it s a possibility that if he runs he d win! He is 85-years old but sharp as a tack unlike some senators we know. Would you vote for Sheriff Joe? The bottom line is there s no way I m going to go fishing. I have no hobbies    Sheriff Joe ArpaioAfter receiving President Trump s first pardon, Joe Arpaio s plans have gone from possible prison to book-writing, speeches and potentially another run for office in Arizona, with Sen. Jeff Flake s seat one opportunity he is eyeing.The former Maricopa County sheriff told the Washington Examiner he s upset at negative reaction to the Friday pardon, and that he feels Republican politicians are insufficiently supportive of the president, who he calls a great man. I could run for mayor, I could run for legislator, I could run for Senate,  Arpaio said Monday. One particular race, however, is likely to gain significant attention: the GOP primary next year facing Flake, R-Ariz., a forceful Trump critic. I m sure getting a lot of people around the state asking me  to challenge Flake, said Arpaio, who served 24 years as sheriff before losing reelection in 2016.  All I m saying is the door is open and we ll see what happens. I ve got support. I know what support I have.

LOL! CROOKED and IRRELEVANT HILLARY CLINTON GOES ON TOUR…Wait Till You See What She’s Asking Fans To Pay For Tickets,"Hillary Clinton will be back in the spotlight this fall for an unprecedented, big-ticket book tour for her new tome What Happened, with tickets priced as high as $1,200.On Monday, the ex-Democratic nominee announced  Hillary Clinton Live,  a 15-city tour, which includes stops in a handful of states she lost in the election last year.The astronomically priced tickets for Hillary s loser tour, certainly begs the question:  If no one came to see Hillary at her rallies (for free) when she was running for president, why would they pay $1,200 to hear the even more irrelevant Hillary Clinton whine about why she lost to Trump? Promotional materials for her first stop, at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., promises Clinton plans to  let loose  and tell her audience a  personal, raw, detailed and surprisingly funny story  of her election loss and recovery.The website promoting the tour, HillaryClintonBookTour.com, features a quote from Clinton too. In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I ve often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net,  she said.  Now I m letting my guard down,  she pledged. The tour kicks off on September 18 in D.C. and continues on all through fall.Clinton is making stops in the trio of states that are largely blamed for her election loss: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.Clinton is hitting up a trio of Canadian cities too, making appearances in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.Top-tier ticket packages in those cities cost $3,000 Canadian dollars for two seats, or, in American dollars, about $1,200 a pop.

5-YR OLD CHRISTIAN GIRL Forced To Live With Non-English Speaking Devout Muslims…Tells Her Christmas and Easter Are Stupid…Takes Away Her Crucifix,"A white five-year-old girl told her mother Christmas and Easter are  stupid  and European women are alcoholics after being fostered to two Muslim families, it was claimed today.The child, who is a native English speaker, also refused to take back her favorite meal   spaghetti carbonara   because it contained bacon   which Muslims do not eat.The child, who is a native English speaker, spent the past six months in two Muslim households after being placed into foster care in Tower Hamlets, east London.She was forced to live in Muslim foster homes where nobody spoke English and her carers took away her Christian cross and encouraged her to learn Arabic, according to The Times.Local authority reports describe how the little girl sobbed and begged not to be returned to her niqab-wearing carer s home, telling a social worker:  They don t speak English. The reports detail how the child was  very distressed  and claimed the foster carer had removed her Christian cross and encouraged her to learn Arabic.The two placements were made by the scandal-hit Tower Hamlets borough council against the wishes of the girl s family.Local authorities are required to give due consideration to a child s religion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background  when placing them into a foster home.The girl s mother is said to be horrified by the circumstances her daughter has been placed in.A friend told the newspaper:  This is a five-year-old white girl. She was born in this country, speaks English as her first language, loves football, holds a British passport and was christened in a church. She s already suffered the huge trauma of being forcibly separated from her family. She needs surroundings in which she ll feel secure. Instead, she s trapped in a world where everything feels foreign and unfamiliar. That s really scary for a young child.

WATCH: NBC’S CHUCK TODD Attempts To “Normalize” ANTIFA TERROR GROUP…Interviews DARTMOUTH PROFESSOR Who Claims Violence Against Trump Supporters Is “Self-Defense” and “Ethical”,"Here is an excerpt from their coverage of Todd s interview:After decades of relative obscurity, the fringe  antifa  movement is becoming a household name after followers clashed with white supremacists at the Charlottesville  Unite the Right  rally where extremist Alex Fields is accused of murdering 32-year-old activist Heather Heyer in a car attack.But the movement is still loosely defined and organized, making it difficult to get a grip on its size and aims.Professor Mark Bray, a historian, and lecturer at Dartmouth, has tried to fill the gap in his new book,  Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,  that chronicles its rise. While Bray doesn t participate in the group s protests, he nonetheless considers himself an ally.Yesterday morning, in advance of the Antifa terror group s attacks on a small group of Trump supporters in Berkeley, NBC s Chuck Todd interviewed Richard Cohen of the radical, leftist Southern Poverty Law Center. Among the many leading questions, Chuck Todd had for the leftist hack Richard Cohen, Todd wanted to help viewers understand how the  sometimes  violent Antifa group is necessary to keep President Trump and his supporters (or  new alt-right groups ) in check.Richard Cohen:  Trump has tremendously energized White Supremacists movement in this country. There s never been a candidate in recent history who s been endorsed by the KKK Cohen goes on to call the people who have backed away from White Supremacists, the  Alt-Light .The what? After Chuck Todd set up the interview with the radical Richard Cohen, he shifted gears to include the pro-Antifa Dartmouth professor Mark Bray in the conversation. Todd conveniently never mentions that Dartmouth University has condemned Professor Bray and his endorsement of violence by Antifa to shut down free speech. Here is a statement from Dartmouth, that NBC s Chuck Todd conveniently glossed over:Here is the statement from Dartmouth, that NBC s Chuck Todd conveniently glossed over:Statement on Lecturer in History Mark Bray August 21, 2017 Recent statements made by Lecturer in History Mark Bray supporting violent protest do not represent the views of Dartmouth.

WATCH ANTIFA THUG Cry Like A Baby After Berkeley Police Unmask and Arrest Her,"Americans watched in horror as live chopper video showed a massive group of Antifa thugs chasing down a lone Trump supporter like a pack of hungry wolves. Once they finally caught the Trump supporter, they surrounded him and began to beat him mercilessly. There were no police in sight.We had an exclusive conversation with a Bernie Sanders supporter who is also a Berkeley resident, who was beaten bloody after feeling compelled to step in help and defend the free speech rights of Trump supporters. The Sanders supporter was shocked to see that one of the Soros supported, Antifa thugs who attacked him was a woman. Although he didn t agree with everything they stood for, he still believed they had the right to free speech and that the Antifa thugs, Black Lives Matter and BAMN (By Any Means Necessary) had no business using violence or the threat of violence to silence them.Watch how the  tough woman  who was wearing a mask, responded to the Berkeley police officers who, according the Bernie Sanders supporter we talked to, had mostly moved to the perimeter of the violence and were allowing it to happen.

"NANCY PELOSI, DEMOCRATS and ANTIFA Force Conservative Prayer Group To Cancel Event Because “a lot of innocent people were going to get hurt”","Joey Gibson of the group Patriot Prayer had planned to hold a peaceful rally with a diverse array of speakers, but ultimately opposition from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, other San Francisco Democrats and the Antifa movement proved too much. Mr. Gibson cancelled the Freedom Rally before it was scheduled to begin Saturday at Crissy Field in San Francisco, saying he feared it would erupt into a  huge riot  fueled by radical activists from antifa and By Any Means Necessary. It was the best thing to do for the city because the way it was set up is that a lot of innocent people were going to get hurt,  Mr. Gibson said during a press conference on Facebook Live.  That s a fact. A bunch of supporters, a bunch of antifa communists, normal liberals would have all been mixed together. It would have been a huge riot, and it would have been a disaster. A separate right-of-center event slated for Sunday in Berkeley called  No to Marxism in America  also was cancelled by organizers over fears of violence.San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee had urged residents instead to attend a rally at Civic Center Plaza, and thousands did, holding a  unite against hate  march while carrying anti-Trump signs and an enormous rainbow banner that said,  Rise and Resist! Ms. Pelosi had called on the National Park Service to reconsider Patriot Prayer s permit, describing the event as a  white supremacist rally. Reason has prevailed because the people of San Francisco have demonstrated our determination to protect the freedom of peaceful expression as well as public safety,  Ms. Pelosi said Saturday in a statement to the Mercury News.But Mr. Gibson accused San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and Ms. Pelosi of stoking unrest by labeling the event as a white supremacy fest, even though most of the scheduled speakers were not white and Mr. Gibson himself is half-Asian. To call us white supremacists made San Francisco way more dangerous,  Mr. Gibson said.

"DEMOCRATS CONVENIENTLY FORGET 6,000 Prisoners Obama Pardoned Including Crack Dealer Who Committed Horrific Crime Against 3 Innocent Americans","Democrats are calling for President Trump s scalp after he pardoned America s toughest law enforcement officer on illegal aliens, Sheriff Joe Arpaio. How quickly the Left and their allies in the media forget about the massive release of felons that were returned to the streets after Obama released them just before he left office. The criminals he released included terrorists and even prisoners from  America s Most Wanted  list. One of his most reckless and horrific releases however, was that of Wendell Callahan, a convicted crack dealer who committed an unimaginable crime against an innocent family.A convicted crack dealer who left prison early as part of the Obama administration s mass release of federal inmates was  indicted by a grand jury for fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend and her two kids in Columbus, Ohio. The gory crime drew national attention because the children, ages 7 and 10, were murdered to eliminate them as witnesses in the brutal massacre of their 32-year-old mother.This week a grand jury in Franklin County returned a 10-count, death-penalty indictment against the ex-con, 35-year-old Wendell Callahan, for the triple murders. Callahan broke into his ex-girlfriend s apartment and stabbed the three victims, according to a statement issued by Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O Brien announcing the indictment. The bloody crime scene was discovered by the woman s current boyfriend, who subsequently engaged in a fight with Callahan before he fled. The indictment includes charges of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design and aggravated murder of victims under the age of 13.  There are multiple charges regarding the three victim deaths because there are different methods to commit the crime of murder and the Prosecutor s Office typically charges all methods , O Brien stated. Callahan is in jail on $3 million bail and is scheduled to be arraigned later this week.Callahan should have been in jail when the crimes occurred, but he was released four years early because federal sentencing guidelines for crack dealers got reduced. The change was part of President Obama s effort to reform the nation s justice system as a way of ending racial discrimination. The initiative was technically launched back in 2010 when the president signed a measure that for the first time in decades relaxed drug-crime sentences he claimed discriminated against poor and minority offenders. This severely weakened a decades-old law enacted during the infamous crack cocaine epidemic that ravaged urban communities nationwide in the 1980s. As part of the movement the U.S. Sentencing Commission lowered maximum sentences for drug offenders and made it retroactive, leading to the early release of thousands of violent thugs like Callahan.In November of 2016, the administration began releasing 6,000 drug convicts coined  non-violent  offenders whose sentences were too long under the old guidelines. News reports quickly surfaced contradicting the administration s assessment that the newly released convicts were not violent. Among them was the leader of a multi-million dollar operation that smuggled drugs from Canada to Maine. Prosecutors refer to the 29-year-old con as a  drug kingpin  who was one of  America s Most Wanted.  Shortly before the administration s mass release of drug convicts, federal prosecutors warned that drug trafficking is inherently violent and therefore the phrase  non-violent drug offenders  is a misnomer. The nation s prosecutors also cautioned that reducing prison sentences for drug offenders will weaken their ability to bring dangerous drug traffickers to justice.As if it weren t bad enough that the administration is rewarding thousands of criminals with get-out-of-jail cards, huge amounts of taxpayer dollars are being spent on programs to help them find housing and jobs.

About Time! Christian Group Sues Amazon and SPLC for Designation as Hate Group,"All we can say on this one is it s about time someone sued the Southern Poverty Law Center!On Tuesday, D. James Kennedy Ministries (DJKM) filed a lawsuit against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the charity navigation organization GuideStar, and Amazon, for defamation, religious discrimination, and trafficking in falsehood. The SPLC listed DJKM as a  hate group,  while GuideStar also categorized it in those terms, and Amazon kept the ministry off of its charity donation program, Amazon Smile. We embarked today on a journey to right a terrible wrong,  Dr. Frank Wright, president and CEO at DJKM, said in a statement Tuesday.  Those who knowingly label Christian ministries as  hate  groups, solely for subscribing to the historic Christian faith, are either woefully uninformed or willfully deceitful. In the case of the Southern Poverty Law Center, our lawsuit alleges the latter. The SPLC has labeled DJKM an  anti-LGBT hate group  for its opposition to same-sex marriage and transgenderism.  These false and illegal characterizations have a chilling effect on the free exercise of religion and on religious free speech for all people of faith,  Wright declared. After having given the SPLC an opportunity to retract, we have undertaken this legal action, seeking a trial by a jury of our peers, to preserve our own rights under the law and to defend the religious free speech rights of all Americans,  the DJKM president concluded.The lawsuit laid out charges against the SPLC, GuideStar, and Amazon.Read more: PJM",politics,"Aug 27, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

SIX FACTS ABOUT Sheriff Joe Arpaio Case That Will Shut Down Every Liberal Crying “Foul” Over President Trump’s Pardon,"Attorney Dario Navarro was one of several leftists who were all of a sudden concerned about the  constitutionality  of President Trump s actions.If Trump issued pardon with specific intent to obstruct justice, it could be challenged as unconstitutional abuse of discretion. #Dems pic.twitter.com/1p9981yyMD  Dario Navarro (@darionavarro111) June 15, 2017Even the New York Times, who helped to sell Barack Obama s horrific Obamacare plan is concerned about Sheriff Joe Arpaio s pardon.Good case for #ArpaioPardon to be considered unconstitutional.Of course, we'd need a congress with a spine first https://t.co/8Z5M1rVr8u  Dimitri (@DimitriWillert) August 26, 2017On July 25, 2016,  America s Sheriff  Joe Arpaio was found guilty of misdemeanor criminal contempt without the benefit of a jury of his peers.Here are a 6 interesting facts that Breitbart News laid out, regarding the Sheriff Joe Arpaio case, that every American crying  foul  over President Trump s pardon yesterday needs to know: The US District judge who tried the case against Sheriff Arpaio was a Bill Clinton appointee. 1. The guilty ruling, by Bill Clinton-appointed U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton, is the latest chapter of a nearly decade-long saga of legal proceedings against Sheriff Joe initiated by leftist groups opposed to his aggressive policing of illegal aliens.The charges against 85 year old Arpaio stem from a civil rights suit demanding he cease  racial profiling  in his Maricopa County Sheriff s Office s immigration enforcement operations. After a federal judge issued an order demanding certain practices, Arpaio was charged with contempt for continuing to try to enforce the law as he saw fit.The misdemeanor charge was a ploy to prevent Sheriff Arpaio from having a jury trial. 2. Because Arpaio was charged only with a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of six-months in jail, the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee him a right to trial by a jury of his peers. Arpaio and his attorneys repeatedly petitioned for a jury, only to be denied by Judge Bolton in March and again in May. Sources familiar with the proceedings have told Breitbart News the decision to charge only the misdemeanor was likely a ploy by federal prosecutors to avoid a jury trial in the community where Arpaio served as sheriff for more than 20 yearsAccording to the NCPD President, the DOJ had no evidence to make their case against Sheriff Arpaio.3. National Center for Police Defense (NCPD) President James Fotis, who was present in the courtroom, was highly skeptical a Phoenix jury could have ever found Arpaio guilty. He told Breitbart News:I sat through three days of testimony and it was clear from the beginning that the DOJ had no evidence to make their case. In fact, all of the DOJ s witnesses made it clear that Judge Snow s order was unclear and ambiguous. There is no way a jury would have determined that the Sheriff willfully and intentionally violated the judge s order. Judge Bolton s ruling has caused me to lose my faith in the court system and the federal judicial system,  Fotis added in a NCPD press release.Over 40,000 signatures were gathered on a petition by current and former law enforcement officers in support of Sheriff Joe Arpaio who they claimed spent his entire career upholding and defending the Constitution. 4. Fotis was hardly the first or only commentator to question the impartiality of Arpaio s prosecution. In June, his group managed to assemble over 40,000 signatures from current and former law enforcement officers in support of Arpaio, delivering them to the Department of Justice in Washington, DC.  After devoting 56-years of his life to upholding and defending the Constitution, Sheriff Arpaio deserves our nation s eternal gratitude   not jail time,  those petitions read.The Judge in the case should have recused himself, but refused to do so. 5. The initial racial profiling suit that eventually led to this conviction also took on political dimensions and its conduct was criticized. The judge in that case, G. Murray Snow, ignored calls to recuse himself based on the fact his brother-in-law is a partner at Covington & Burling, the firm representing those suing Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff s Office.President Obama spent much of his 8 years in office trying to find a way to take down America s toughest Sheriff on illegal immigrants, who also headed up an independent investigation into the alleged fake birth certificate that would prove Barack Obama was not born in the United States. 6. The decision to criminally prosecute Arpaio was taken while the DOJ was run by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. It would be highly unusual for new leadership to intervene and drop an ongoing prosecution, and no such step was taken, despite the aforementioned petitions.

HEY CNN…REMEMBER OBAMA’S Notorious “Friday Night News Dumps” and When He REFUSED To Interrupt Golf On Martha’s Vineyard To Assess Historic Louisiana Floods?,"Republican Rep. Steve King: The base is going to behind President Trump's decision to pardon Joe Arpaio https://t.co/17fLpkPgcf  CNN (@CNN) August 26, 2017CNN was apoplectic about having to cover the hurricane when they had so many opportunities to manufacture news about President Trump. They published this story tonight as Hurricane Harvey was hitting the coast of Texas:3 headlines the White House hopes you ll miss as Hurricane Harvey hitsAs the strongest hurricane to make landfall in the US in more than a decade took aim at Texas, President Donald Trump s White House engaged in an age-old Washington tradition: the Friday news dump.Transgender individuals? Banned from joining the military. Convicted Sheriff Joe Arpaio? Officially pardoned. Controversial White House adviser Sebastian Gorka? Out of a white House job.All three headlines popped after 6 p.m. Friday as TV news broadcasts and websites turned their attention to Texas, where Hurricane Harvey was preparing to make landfall as a Category 4 hurricane   the most powerful to hit the US since 2004.CNN probably forgot about Barack Obama s notorious  Friday night news dumps Here are a few of Obama s greatest hits:From Hot Air:Isn t it funny what you can find out on Friday evening about what our executive branch does? For instance, Agence France-Presse reported last night that Barack Obama bypassed Congress to send $192 million to the Palestinian Authority, claiming that national security required the US to put money into Mahmoud Abbas  pocket.Congress deliberately froze those funds, and not just because of the statehood demand through UNESCO. Hamas, a terrorist organization, reconciled with Fatah and has rejoined the PA, which means we re putting almost $200 million into the hands of a terrorist organization. The language of the Palestinian Accountability Act could not be clearer:  [N]o funds available to any United States Government department or agency   may be obligated or expended with respect to providing funds to the Palestinian Authority.  Obama literally waived that statutory language off yesterday afternoon. From Politico:Reporters and Capitol Hill staff tracking the Solyndra saga know better than to make plans for Friday nights: That s when the Obama administration likes to dump documents requested by Congress.At least five times since last fall s bankruptcy filing and FBI raid of the California solar company, the White House and other agencies have chosen to release embarrassing emails and other materials late in the afternoon as the workweek ends   a time almost guaranteed to garner the least media attention possible.From Townhall:The Obama administration Friday pulled the plug on a major program in the president s signature health overhaul law   a long-term care insurance plan dogged from the beginning by doubts over its financial solvency. Targeted by congressional Republicans for repeal, the long-term care plan became the first casualty in the political and policy wars over the health care law. The program had been expected to launch in 2013.  This is a victory for the American taxpayer and future generations,  said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., spearheading opposition in the Senate.  The administration is finally admitting (the long-term care plan) is unsustainable and cannot be implemented. While President Trump has had a very busy day today, he s clearly not so busy that he hasn t been focused on, and assessing what the federal government can do to help the victims of the hurricane this evening.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2017 Where was President Obama when the most serious natural disaster happened during his 8 years in office? He was golfing on Martha s Vineyard, and refused to leave his golfing vacation to assess the situation.President Obama is stirring resentment over his refusal to interrupt his Martha s Vineyard vacation to survey the Louisiana flood   the worst U.S. natural disaster since 2012   while drawing comparisons to President George W. Bush s hotly criticized response to Hurricane Katrina in the same state.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson defended Mr. Obama at a press conference Thursday, insisting that the president is  closely monitoring  the situation but that he will not cut short his two-week breather in the tony Massachusetts resort. The president can t be everywhere,  Mr. Johnson told reporters in Denham Springs, Louisiana.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, backed him up, saying at the press conference that he is  not complaining in any way about our federal partnership. Even so, Mr. Obama s lack of urgency is drawing unflattering parallels to the federal response in 2005, when Mr. Bush was branded as uncaring and even racist for not touching down during a flyover two days after Hurricane Katrina.

BREAKING NEWS: SEBASTIAN GORKA OUT…Are Ivanka and Jared Behind His Resignation?,"UPDATE: White House official says, ""Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House."" https://t.co/nHPCg5XhOW  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) August 26, 2017According to The Telegraph, now that Mr Bannon is on the outside, he will target a ring of presidential advisers sometimes known as the  globalists . It includes Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, with whom Mr Bannon appeared to have lost a battle over putting more troops in Afghanistan. Now, only one week after Bannon leaves the White House, The Federalist is reporting that Sebastian Gorka has resigned from his post as Deputy Assistant to President Trump, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation.In a blunt resignation letter, the national security and counterterrorism expert expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of the Trump administration.  [G]iven recent events, it is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA promise are   for now   ascendant within the White House,  Gorka wrote.  As a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the People s House. Gorka s letter expressed unhappiness with the direction the Trump administration s foreign policy has taken, as signaled by the president s recent speech on Afghanistan: Regrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will  Make America Great Again,  have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months. This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week The fact that those who drafted and approved the speech removed any mention of Radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of your presidential campaign has been lost Just as worrying, when discussing our future actions in the region, the speech listed operational objectives without ever defining the strategic victory conditions we are fighting for. This omission should seriously disturb any national security professional, and any American who is unsatisfied with the last 16 years of disastrous policy decisions which have led to thousands of Americans killed and trillions of taxpayer dollars spent in ways that have not brought security or victory. During his time in the Trump administration, Gorka focused on issues such as countering the Muslim Brotherhood, the crisis in Qatar, supporting efforts to draft a new long-term national security strategy, and combatting China s economic warfare. Before coming to the White House, Gorka was the Major General Matthew C. Horner Chair at Marine Corps University and also contributed to Breitbart News.Gorka s tenure at the White House was marked by unusually vociferous attacks against him and his family by left-leaning media organizations and the Democratic Party. This includes personal attacks against his wife, mother, and son.A source close to the White House said of his decision,  This was more or less going to be a done deal when Bannon submitted his resignation. Not because he didn t have a protector, but because there is no point in having your life ruined every day if you re not going to get much accomplished.  The same source said that what did change after Bannon left was that anti-Bannon factions began erecting bureaucratic road blocks to undermine Gorka internally.

Breaking: President Trump Pardons Sheriff Joe Arpaio [Video]," Reuters is reporting: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday granted a pardon to former Arizona lawman and political ally Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed  toughest sheriff in America,  less than a month after he was convicted of criminal contempt in a case involving his department s racial profiling policy.Trump had signaled this week that the first presidential pardon of his administration would go to Arpaio, 85, whom he has frequently praised for his hardline immigration stance.Here s a hint from President Trump during his speech this past week in Phoenix: I think he s going to be just fine    President TrumpSTATEMENT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE:BREAKING: President Trump pardons former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio pic.twitter.com/P56QQ3agmy  Josh Caplan (@joshdcaplan) August 26, 2017",politics,"Aug 25, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
LOL! LEFTIST RAG PUBLISHES Story About How President Trump Will Use Racist #HurricaneHarvey To Harm Blacks,"You just can t make this stuff up The leftist rag, Daily Kos actually wrote a story about how President Trump will disproportionately harm blacks after Hurricane Harvey attacks them in Texas.Here is the actual tweet pushing their insane story about a racist Hurricane Harvey:Hurricane Harvey poised to disproportionately impact blacks in Texas, but no one is talking about it https://t.co/A6JrT6CYUp  Daily Kos (@dailykos) August 25, 2017Here s an excerpt from the article:As Texas braces itself for Hurricane Harvey, the Trump administration remains woefully ignorant and unprepared. The current FEMA director is working to rewrite the Federal Flood Insurance Program so that the federal government bears less of the cost when disasters strike and flooding occurs. On the surface, that might sound like a fiscally responsible move. But it s loaded with inconsistencies and will most certainly not work out well for local cities, states or residents. Additionally, since Trump seems to be firing people weekly but taking his sweet time in hiring them, no one has been appointed to lead both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS oversees FEMA and the Coast Guard so it s almost guaranteed that the response to this storm will be chaos. This is shaping up to be another Hurricane Katrina complete with a devastating impact on black and brown communities.Southeast Texas and the coastal bend regions of the state are expected to be the hardest hit. While Hispanics make up about 40 percent of the state s population, Texas has one of the largest black populations in the country. And they live concentrated in the areas that are predicted to be hardest hit. For example, several counties have already been declared a state of disaster by Republican Gov. Greg AbbottNoteworthy also is the high percentage of people in poverty [in Texas] who are African American women, especially single parents. Of the 24% of African Americans below poverty level, single mothers make up 65%.

WHOA! Did “White Supremacist” Who Organized Charlottesville Protests Work For CNN? Were Protests Manufactured To Create Hate For Right and Trump?,"Has anyone seen Barack Obama lately? What about Valerie Jarrett, who actually MOVED IN to the Obama household shortly after exiting the White House? Why would Obama s 60-year old former senior advisor move into his house with his wife and daughter who is still in high school? Unless there was some obvious reason for her living with the Obama s, it makes no sense whatsoever. Why does no one in the media find this arrangement to be even remotely odd? Is it possible that Barack Obama and his evil puppet-master had something to do with orchestrating what many believe was a fake protest in Charlottesville, as a way to create hate for white people, the Right and more importantly to give Americans a reason to blame President Trump and the Republican Party for the actions of the racist groups who participated in the protests.Immediately after the violence in Charlottesville took place, President Trump took to Twitter and turned to the media to (rightfully) condemn both sides of the conflict.We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017Curiously, the former president, who s been keeping a very low profile leading up to the Charlottesville protests, tweeted a response to Charlottesville. CNN called Obama s response on Twitter,  The most linked tweet in the history of Twitter.  CNN was so giddy over the response to Obama s tweet, they actually published an entire story on the success of his tweets:Former President Barack Obama s tweet reacting to the attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, is the most liked tweet ever on the social network.Obama s reaction to the Charlottesville attack is also the fifth-most retweeted behind a tweet from a teen who wanted free chicken nuggets from Wendy s, Ellen Degeneres  tweet from 2014 Oscars, a tweet from singer Louis Tomlinson to his One Direction bandmate Harry Styles and Ariana Grande s previously mentioned tweet.So, what exactly was the media s role in using the Charlottesville protests to push the false narrative that,  President Trump is a racist? Nation One News decided to do a little digging into the leader of the allegedly  White Supremacist  leader who organized the  Unite the Right  rally in Charlottesville, and here are a few very curious things they found:First of all, the ACLU defended Jason Kessler and forced the city to keep his permit in place. This was after the city raised concerns about the ability of Law Enforcement to keep Antifa, BLM, and the New Black Panthers from clashing with the White Supremacists who were attending with Jason Kessler.Here are a few things you need to know about Jason Kessler.First, he supports gun control. Second, he LOVES Obama and Clinton! Third, He LOVED the Iran deal struck by Obama!Fourth, Hates Republicans and compared them to Dahmer.Finally, he claims he was  Red Pilled  into becoming a Trump Supporter ?He claims he was  red pilled  by the  media instigating the Baltimore riots.  However, an Advanced search of his Tweets only reveals one Tweet raising questions or assigning blame for the Baltimore Riots. That Tweet was sent a month AFTER this so called  red pill  or change of heart.So who is this guy really? Well, at least some of rumors on the Internet are True, he was, in fact, a Liberal and he admitted it. His reason for changing his mind doesn t add up, based on the evidence.He has Tweeted 4843 times and he never mentioned the Baltimore Riots prior to his change of heart.One last thing.We are researching to determine if he used to work for or with CNN. CNN has not responded to our calls or emails. It is possible that another Jason Kessler worked for CNN, however, the Jason Kessler from Charlottesville have a gap in his Linked In profile from 2009 to 2013.According to SNOPES, the left wing  fact-checker  source, they ve talked to CNN, who confirms they never employed the Jason Kessler who clashed with BLM and Antifa in Charlottesville. So cased closed right?Here is what the LEFT-wing SNOPES had to say:Did Kessler write articles for CNN that were sympathetic to the Occupy movement?False. Kessler says he never worked for CNN, and we spoke to a source at CNN who confirmed it. A writer named Jason Kessler was once employed by CNN, and he did cover Occupy Wall Street protests among many other topics, but according to CNN it was not the same Jason Kessler who went on to lead Unite the Right.Except that Americans have become much less trusting of these so-called  fact-checkers  and sources they used to believe were honest about the news they reported. We no longer believe anything SNOPES or the Very Fake News CNN has to say. Jason Kessler used to run a blog called jasonkessler.net, however, the site is conveniently taken down.

WATCH: BLACK SPORTS HOST BLASTS White ESPN Sports Host For Asking White Athletes To Take A Knee During National Anthem,"When will Americans stop being afraid of standing up to leftist agitators and tell them,  NO!  When will Americans find a backbone and stop allowing the left to dictate what they re allowed to say or to feel? Why are white Americans allowing themselves and law enforcement officers of every race and ethnicity to be thrown under the bus, because we re led by the radical left to believe that it will somehow make us better people.Oddly, sports channels have decided to assume the role of America s social conscience. Sports used to be a unifying force for Americans, a place for perfect strangers to come together and bond over their love and support for a particular team. The Disney owned ESPN sports network has been working very hard to change that.Fear and intimidation are two of the tools the Left uses in order to make people comply with their message of unity through division. And according to one TV and radio sports host, these tactics are beginning to take hold in the NFL.Fox Sports 1 host Jason Whitlock joined Tucker Carlson Monday evening on Fox News   Tucker Carlson Tonight  to talk about the state of protesting during the National Anthem in the NFL.Whitlock understands that protesting is perfectly within players  rights as Americans, but he takes issue with the method in which people like unemployed quarterback Colin Kaepernick go about protesting. There are NFL players, black and white, who know that if you really want to address police brutality, social justice, inequality in this country, protesting the National Anthem is the perfect way for your message to get completely lost,  Whitlock told Carlson.NFL players have so many platforms on which to voice their approval or displeasure on whatever issue they re championing this week. But to use the National Anthem as the vehicle for their message only causes their message fall flat in the eyes of a lot of football fans. These  silent protests  don t make them look heroic, but rather selfish.Whitlock also posed an interesting theory to Carlson concerning players who aren t participating in these social justice protests. I want to know why NFL players aren t offering voices of dissent?  Whitlock asked. You can t tell me that there aren t NFL players who recognize the stupidity of the style of protest Colin Kaepernick has chosen,  Whitlock said.  But they re all afraid to say it because of the backlash. Another good point.We have seen sports entities like the NFL and ESPN become bastions of social justice promotion in an age where people are being divided into more groups than the  Divergent  series.

LT GEN JOHN KELLY’S INCREDIBLE SPEECH Just Days After His Own Son Was Killed In Action: “Brave Men On Watch All Over the World Tonight—For YOU”,"Just days after the death of his own son in combat, Lt Gen John Kelly eulogized two other sons in an unforgettable manner:Two years ago when I was the Commander of all U.S. and Iraqi forces, in fact, the 22nd of April 2008, two Marine infantry battalions, 1/9  The Walking Dead,  and 2/8 were switching out in Ramadi. One battalion in the closing days of their deployment going home very soon, the other just starting its seven-month combat tour.Two Marines, Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan Haerter, 22 and 20 years old respectively, one from each battalion, were assuming the watch together at the entrance gate of an outpost that contained a makeshift barracks housing 50 Marines.The same broken down ramshackle building was also home to 100 Iraqi police, also my men and our allies in the fight against the terrorists in Ramadi, a city until recently the most dangerous city on earth and owned by Al Qaeda. Yale was a dirt poor mixed-race kid from Virginia with a wife and daughter, and a mother and sister who lived with him and he supported as well. He did this on a yearly salary of less than $23,000. Haerter, on the other hand, was a middle class white kid from Long Island.They were from two completely different worlds. Had they not joined the Marines they would never have met each other, or understood that multiple America s exist simultaneously depending on one s race, education level, economic status, and where you might have been born. But they were Marines, combat Marines, forged in the same crucible of Marine training, and because of this bond they were brothers as close, or closer, than if they were born of the same woman.The mission orders they received from the sergeant squad leader I am sure went something like:  Okay you two clowns, stand this post and let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass.   You clear?  I am also sure Yale and Haerter then rolled their eyes and said in unison something like:  Yes Sergeant,  with just enough attitude that made the point without saying the words,  No kidding sweetheart, we know what we re doing.  They then relieved two other Marines on watch and took up their post at the entry control point of Joint Security Station Nasser, in the Sophia section of Ramadi, al Anbar, Iraq.A few minutes later a large blue truck turned down the alley way perhaps 60-70 yards in length and sped its way through the serpentine of concrete jersey walls. The truck stopped just short of where the two were posted and detonated, killing them both catastrophically. Twenty-four brick masonry houses were damaged or destroyed. A mosque 100 yards away collapsed. The truck s engine came to rest two hundred yards away knocking most of a house down before it stopped.Our explosive experts reckoned the blast was made of 2,000 pounds of explosives. Two died, and because these two young infantrymen didn t have it in their DNA to run from danger, they saved 150 of their Iraqi and American brothers-in-arms.When I read the situation report about the incident a few hours after it happened I called the regimental commander for details as something about this struck me as different. Marines dying or being seriously wounded is commonplace in combat. We expect Marines regardless of rank or MOS to stand their ground and do their duty, and even die in the process, if that is what the mission takes. But this just seemed different.The regimental commander had just returned from the site and he agreed, but reported that there were no American witnesses to the event just Iraqi police. I figured if there was any chance of finding out what actually happened and then to decorate the two Marines to acknowledge their bravery, I d have to do it as a combat award that requires two eye-witnesses and we figured the bureaucrats back in Washington would never buy Iraqi statements. If it had any chance at all, it had to come under the signature of a general officer.I traveled to Ramadi the next day and spoke individually to a half-dozen Iraqi police all of whom told the same story. The blue truck turned down into the alley and immediately sped up as it made its way through the serpentine. They all said,  We knew immediately what was going on as soon as the two Marines began firing.  The Iraqi police then related that some of them also fired, and then to a man, ran for safety just prior to the explosion.All survived. Many were injured   some seriously. One of the Iraqis elaborated and with tears welling up said,  They d run like any normal man would to save his life. What he didn t know until then, he said, and what he learned that very instant, was that Marines are not normal. Choking past the emotion he said,  Sir, in the name of God no sane man would have stood there and done what they did. No sane man. They saved us all. What we didn t know at the time, and only learned a couple of days later after I wrote a summary and submitted both Yale and Haerter for posthumous Navy Crosses, was that one of our security cameras, damaged initially in the blast, recorded some of the suicide attack. It happened exactly as the Iraqis had described it. It took exactly six seconds from when the truck entered the alley until it detonated.You can watch the last six seconds of their young lives. Putting myself in their heads I supposed it took about a second for the two Marines to separately come to the same conclusion about what was going on once the truck came into their view at the far end of the alley. Exactly no time to talk it over, or call the sergeant to ask what they should do. Only enough time to take half an instant and think about what the sergeant told them to do only a few minutes before:     let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass. The two Marines had about five seconds left to live. It took maybe another two seconds for them to present their weapons, take aim, and open up. By this time the truck was half-way through the barriers and gaining speed the whole time. Here, the recording shows a number of Iraqi police, some of whom had fired their AKs, now scattering like the normal and rational men they were some running right past the Marines. They had three seconds left to live.For about two seconds more, the recording shows the Marines  weapons firing non-stop the truck s windshield exploding into shards of glass as their rounds take it apart and tore in to the body of the son-of-a-bitch who is trying to get past them to kill their brothers American and Iraqi bedded down in the barracks totally unaware of the fact that their lives at that moment depended entirely on two Marines standing their ground. If they had been aware, they would have know they were safe   because two Marines stood between them and a crazed suicide bomber.The recording shows the truck careening to a stop immediately in front of the two Marines. In all of the instantaneous violence Yale and Haerter never hesitated. By all reports and by the recording, they never stepped back. They never even started to step aside. They never even shifted their weight. With their feet spread shoulder width apart, they leaned into the danger, firing as fast as they could work their weapons. They had only one second left to live.The truck explodes. The camera goes blank. Two young men go to their God.Six seconds.Not enough time to think about their families, their country, their flag, or about their lives or their deaths, but more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty   into eternity. That is the kind of people who are on watch all over the world tonight for you.

DEMOCRAT LEGAL EXPERT Shocks The Left With His Take On Statues [Video],"Legal expert and Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley makes a case for why we need to ADD to statues and not take them down. He says we can learn more from keeping them up in direct opposition to what Democrats are saying:TURLEY RECENTLY ARGUED AGAINST THE REMOVAL OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON STATUE: George Washington may have survived the winter at Valley Forge, but he may not see the end of the summer of Charlottesville. Bishop James Dukes of Chicago s Liberation Christian Center and others are calling for the removal of his and Andrew Jackson s statues and and stripping of their names from parks. Dukes insists that these monuments are  a slap in the face and it s a disgrace  for African Americans given their history as slave owning presidents.The bishop s call for the removal of our first president s statue is the latest effort to strip away the names of historical figures over ties to slavery or segregation. There is a movement to remove the name of Woodrow Wilson (who helped establish Princeton as a world academic institution) from buildings and schools, due to his support for segregation. The University of Virginia was founded by Thomas Jefferson, but last year, University President Teresa Sullivan was denounced by students and faculty for merely quoting our third president in a public message because he was a slave owner.The call to remove Washington s statue came less than a day after President Trump asked whether Washington would be next in the movement to remove statues like the Robert E. Lee monument in Charlottesville. The statement drew the ire of CNN s Jim Acosta who described the notion as absurd and said it was  taken as a sign that the president perhaps needs a refresher course and needs to go back to History 101.  History is precisely where this controversy should begin and end. Washington is rightfully condemned for his ownership of slaves. There were contemporaries like John Adams, John Jay, Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton who were outspoken critics of slavery. Franklin called slavery  an atrocious debasement of human nature,  while Adams referred to it as a  foul contagion in the human character.  These visionaries not only saw a great evil but answered the call of history to stand steadfastly against it.However, before Mayor Rahm Emanuel sends in the bulldozers into Washington Park, it is worth considering a few facts about our first president s history with slavery. Washington inherited a number of slaves at age 11 and received more slaves in his marriage to Martha Custis. However, he gradually came to oppose slavery. On the interim, Washington tried to assuage his guilt by refusing to sell slaves that would break up families, telling an associate that it was  against my inclination to hurt the feelings of those unhappy people by a separation of man and wife, or of families. After the war, Washington continued to discuss ways to convert his plantation from slaves to tenants at the suggestion of his close aide (and outspoken opponent of slavery) Marquis de Lafayette. By 1786, Washington wrote his friend Robert Morris,  I can only say that there is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of [slavery]. In the end, Washington was the only one of nine slaveholding presidents (and the only slaveholding founder) who freed his slaves upon his death. Washington freed as many of his 317 slaves as possible. Some 123 slaves were his to emancipate while neither he nor Martha could free the so-called  Custis Dower slaves  (who remained property of the heirs to the estate of Daniel Parke Custis, Martha Washington s first husband). He further ordered that all of the elderly or sick slaves would be supported by his estate for the rest of their lives.So where does this leave us? With a complex and flawed figure who practiced a great evil while belatedly coming to reject it. He finished his life allied with his more enlightened colleagues but this is no reason to forgive his prior history. However, that is the point of history. It is never some neat narrative divided cleanly between demons and angels. Washington was a great leader who held a nation together through sheer leadership and stands as one of the few leaders in history to refuse to become a monarch himself.Curiously, Dukes does offer a concession. Washington Park and Jackson Park could be formally named after former Mayor Harold Washington and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson or singer Michael Jackson. It is unlikely to convince those who view these statutes as not simply reminders of past leaders but past struggles in an evolving society. The same cannot be said for Michael Jackson.  Thriller  may be the best selling album in history, but the Battle of New Orleans still has more of a hold on history.The fact is that we often learn as much from the failures as we do the triumphs of historical figures. Washington ultimately proved to be an early transitional figure in our ugly history of slavery. Washington himself described his desire at Mount Vernon  to lay a foundation  for a  rising generation  with a  new destiny  other than slavery.For my part, I am proud to teach at the George Washington University, whose charter was paid for by Washington himself as part of that same final testament. Of course, that does not mean we could not make other improvements. Another school in Washington is named after a British king, George II, who kept our nation under colonial oppression. After all, the moonwalk and robot dance steps did have a transformative impact on my generation  and  Jacksontown University  has a nice ring to it.Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.

CNN PROPAGANDIST JAKE TAPPER Claims to Speak for You: “Great Concern” for President Trump’s “Stability” [Video],"Jake Tapper gave an Oscar-worthy performance with his fake concern for  most Americans  who he claims are thinking President Trump is  unfit for office . He jumped on comments made by Sen. Bob Corker last week, when Corker suggested that he doubted Trump s  stability  and  competence.  The left is thrilled with this idiotic comment from Corker Tapper and the Dems will ride this narrative for as long as they can!Tapper announced:  According to a new Quinnipiac University poll released this afternoon, voters overwhelmingly saying President Trump is not level-headed, 68 percent to 29 percent. Voters saying President Trump does not provide the U.S. with moral leadership, 62 to 35 percent. That he s not honest, 61 to 36 percent. Voters believe by a two to one margin that President Trump is doing more to divide the country than to unite it, 62 to 31 percent. Nearly six in 10 voters say President Trump s decisions and behavior have encouraged white supremacist groups. Now President Trump is a man who looks to numbers and to ratings. These numbers, sir, these numbers are disastrous. Tapper concluded with his effort to speak for the majority of Americans according to some poll:  You are no doubt pleasing your base, but your behavior is causing great concern among the majority of the American people.

BOXING LEGEND GEORGE FOREMAN Reveals How Trump Saved Him When He Was “Broke…Bankrupt”…BLASTS Athletes Like Kaepernick and Durant For Disrespecting Our Nation,"You can t be black and support President Trump. The intolerant left simply won t allow it Boxing legend George Foreman has had about enough of the disrespect of the United States he s seeing in some professional athletes, particularly Colin Kaepernick and Kevin Durant.In an interview on the Offended America Podcast on Monday, the 68-year-old former world heavyweight boxing champion blasted the national anthem protests and shunning of the White House by the likes of Kaepernick and Durant, suggesting they were born out of ignorance about just how privileged we are to live in this great country.As for Durant s announcement that he would not attend the White House if his Golden State Warriors are invited because he doesn t  respect who s in office right now,  Foreman said he and the others protesting Trump were just  sore losers. In the interview, Foreman also praised Donald Trump, who played a pivotal role in his personal comeback at age 42, helping to fund and promote his match with another boxing great, Evander Holyfield. Before the fight, Foreman said he was  broke   bankrupt.  But Trump, he said, helped save him financially. He s part of writing those checks so I could be back on the wealthy side again,  said Foreman. -Daily WireFox and Friends   Shortly after his inauguration, George Foreman offered some wise words of advice for his friend Donald J.

PELOSI JUST FLUNKED CONSTITUTIONAL LAW: ‘You Can’t Cry Wolf in a Crowded Theater’ [Video],"Nancy Pelosi just flunked Constitutional Law! Pelosi repeated her request that the National Park Service deny a permit to an alleged  alt-right demonstration  called Patriot Prayer. Pelosi said  not allow these elements to use a national park to spew forth their venom.  She then said that  protecting people  was the Park Service s  first responsibility. This is a trend of the left lately they claim stopping free speech, protests and removing statues have become  homeland security  issues. Jeh Johnson just commented this week that we must remove statues because they ve become a  homeland security  issue. See where this is going? The left claims to be for free speech but in reality they aren t for anyone on the opposing side speaking out. This is getting into dangerous territory but not because of what the right is doing IronicJEH JOHNSON SUDDENLY THINKS CONFEDERATE STATUES ARE A THREAT TO HOMELAND SECURITY: This is rich! The guy who opened our borders to criminals during the Obama era is now telling us that statues are a homeland security threat?  Former Obama administration official Jeh Johnson said on This Week with Martha Raditz that the removal of Confederate statues was a matter of  public safety and homeland security  on Sunday Oh brother!According to David French of National Review:Where to begin? First, It s flat-out unconstitutional for the park service to deny a permit to any group simply because public officials deem the group s speech venomous. Even if their speech is truly vile, they have the same right of access to the park as any other expressive organization.Second, while we want law enforcement to protect people, it is also required to protect liberty. Any police force that maintains security without also protecting liberty has failed in its core constitutional function.Third, the quote is wrong. She s obviously referring to Oliver Wendell Holmes s famous statement in Schenck v. United States that  The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.  Fire. Wolf. Whatever. It s not important compared to the next point below.Fourth, anyone who quotes Schenck is quoting bad law. In fact, it s one of the most  odious free speech decisions in the Court s history.  The court upheld the Espionage Act conviction of the secretary of the Socialist Party of America for writing and distributing a pamphlet opposing the draft during World War I. Schenck could never be sent to jail for this conduct today.",politics,"Aug 24, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

MARK STEYN’S HYSTERICAL Take On Hillary’s “Back Up You Creep” Comment In Her New Book [Video],"Steyn:  Now Hillary knows how Bill s victims feel Haha! Mark Steyn was awesome tonight on Tucker Carlson:Oh my gosh! We can t stop laughing at Steyn s account of Hillary on pretty much everything. The best had to be how Clinton lied about how she was named. Too funny!HERE S OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE BIG WHOPPER HILLARY TOLD ABOUT HER NAME: This story is from 2006 and is the first in a long series of Hillary s lies that we ll be exposing over the next couple of months For more than a decade, one piece of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton s informal biography has been that she was named for Sir Edmund Hillary, the conqueror of Mount Everest. The story was even recounted in Bill Clinton s autobiography.But yesterday, Mrs. Clinton s campaign said she was not named for Sir Edmund after all. It was a sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter, to great results I might add,  said Jennifer Hanley, a spokeswoman for the campaign.In May 1953, Sir Edmund and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, became the first men to reach the summit of Mount Everest. In 1995, shortly after meeting Sir Edmund, Mrs. Clinton said that her mother, Dorothy Rodham, had long told her she was named for the famous mountaineer.  It had two l s, which is how she thought she was supposed to spell Hillary,  Mrs. Clinton said at the time, after meeting Sir Edmund.  So when I was born, she called me Hillary, and she always told me it s because of Sir Edmund Hillary. Even though Bill Clinton repeated the story in his 2004 autobiography,  My Life,  Hillary Clinton did not mention it in her own autobiography,  Living History,  which was published in 2003.But one big hole has been poked in the story over the years, both in cyberspace and elsewhere: Sir Edmund became famous only after climbing Everest in 1953. Mrs. Clinton, as it happens, was born in 1947.

AMERICAN-MADE CONFEDERATE FLAG FACTORY Sees A Huge Change In Sales After Charlottesville,"You d think people would be afraid to order a Confederate flag after the riot in Charlottesville BUT this Alabama flag factory is seeing a huge jump in sales The story of how this single flag manufacturer was started and has flourished is bittersweet ALABAMA FLAG & BANNER SALES SURGE!Sales of Confederate flags surged at Alabama Flag & Banner, which may be the only company still manufacturing the flags in the United States. Belinda Kennedy, the owner, sees the flag as a historical symbol.Rebel flag sales are up since Charlottesville. One north Alabama shop may be the only flag manufacturer in America meeting the increased demand.Alabama Flag & Banner is located in a small strip near downtown Huntsville. Two years ago, the company began manufacturing the Confederate flag after retailers pulled it from their shelves in the wake of the mass shooting at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, S.C. in which nine people were killed by a white supremacist who d been photographed holding a Confederate flag.The country s major flag manufacturers stopped producing rebel flags. Eventually, said longtime owner Belinda Kennedy, Alabama Flag & Banner became the go-to manufacturer for hundreds of retailers across the country looking to stock American-made Confederate flags. Online orders boomed, too.Two weeks ago, after the deadly Charlottesville rally sparked a national debate about whether Confederate monuments should be removed from parks around the country, flag sales spiked again. After the church shooting (in 2015), Amazon and Walmart stopped selling (the flag) and people were afraid they wouldn t be able to buy it,  she said.  And then you started seeing streets renamed, schools being renamed, mountains being renamed. And then people started getting angry. And then there s another surge (in sales). Since 2015, Alabama Flag & Banner has sold an average of 600-800 Confederate flags a year. Before that, they typically made a handful of special orders per year because they were able to order flags from a larger manufacturer.Kennedy said there are now Chinese-made flags available elsewhere, and she s seen a handful of individuals online who hand-sew flags to order, but as far as she knows her business is the only one in the country currently manufacturing Confederate flags.About half of the Confederate flags at her shop are a more labor-intensive appliqued flag which retails for anywhere from $93 to upwards of $200. The rest are a less expensive screen-printed flag, which costs $38.50 for a 3  x 5  flag. Everybody s got a different reason (for buying),  she said.  By and large, I think people are afraid they may not be able to get it one day. Confederate flags represent only a fraction of her business, she said, and she has not needed to hire any extra help so far. She has a team of seven or eight seamstresses, some of them Hispanic, who work on the manufacturing side, hand-stitching appliqued flags and preparing the screen-printed flags.Downstairs in Kennedy s office is a double-frame picture of two of her great-great-grandfathers, who fought for the South in the Civil War. I think there is a bigger racial divide in our country than what we ve had in many years,  said Kennedy.  I think a lot of it is (because) we re trying to sanitize history. You ve got white supremacists, but then you ve got people like me who are history buffs, pushing back and saying, don t change history. Removing Confederate monuments is not right, she said. She echoed President Donald Trump s remarks about the Charlottesville violence, asking where the country should draw the line at removing monuments because founding fathers like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.The Confederate flag, in her view, has been co-opted for something it doesn t represent. She hated seeing it carried by white supremacists in Charlottesville. When you ve got people like the Ku Klux Klan and these neo-Nazi groups, the white supremacists, when they hijack the flag, that should be a crime,  she said,  because that s not what the flag is about. But that s what makes people so vehemently, adamantly opposed to the flag. Since 2015, Kennedy has been no stranger to attention, though she said she dislikes most of the publicity and news coverage surrounding the Confederate flag. Outlets such as CNN and Yahoo News have already interviewed Kennedy this week as part of coverage of the monument debate.A self-avowed Daughter of the Confederacy, Kennedy does not see herself as a crusader for the Confederate cause. But she doesn t accept that the flag   or monuments, for that matter   are anything more than a symbol of heritage or history. When we start trying to rewrite our history, we are forgetting our history,  she said.  Does anybody really think by taking down monuments and renaming mountains and taking down Confederate flags, that we are really going to see racism end? That s not going to fix it.Read more: AL.com",politics,"Aug 23, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

He followed the latest leftist line that Trump  isn t fit to serve Yes, the loony left has a new play book that makes the false claim that somehow Trump is  unfit  to be president.We ve reported on clapper before but his  not wittingly  comment before the Senate is legend. Remember when he was asked if the NSA spies on Americans and he replied  not wittingly ? Yes, well, that was perjury.More recently Clapper bashed President Trump during a discussion on national security and the Trump/Russia fake scandal.It s clear that Clapper is a political pawn who is out to try and make our president look bad.

“DIRTY JOBS” HOST MIKE ROWE Absolutely Destroys Guy Who Called Him A White Nationalist," Dirty Jobs  host Mike Rowe went off on a guy who claimed Rowe is a  white nationalist . The usual happy-go-lucky Rowe was clearly ticked when he wrote back to Chuck Adkins.Chuck Adkins asked Rowe:  One of the tenants of white nationalism is that college educated people are academic elitists. Comment? No? I m not surprised. You never take a political stand because you don t want to alienate anybody. Its bad for business. I get it. But there is a current of anti intellectualism in this country   promoted by Republicans. Those people love you, and they think your initiative is their initiative. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is kickin our ass academically. Rowe responded with a blistering rebuke of Adkins and the liberal media: Since we re being candid, allow me to say how much I dislike your post. Everything about it annoys me   your smug and snarky tone, your appalling grammar, your complete lack of evidence to support your claims, and of course, the overarching logical fallacy that informs your entire position,  Rowe wrote.  What really bugs me though, is the fact that you re not entirely wrong. It s true; I haven t shared any political opinions this week, in part anyway, because doing so might very well be  bad for business. What can I say? I work for half-a-dozen different companies, none of whom pay me to share my political opinions. I run a non-partisan foundation, I m about to launch a new show on Facebook, and I m very aware that celebrities pay a price for opening their big fat gobs. Gilbert Gottfried, Kathy Griffin, Colin Kaepernick, Milo Yiannopoulos even that guy from Google who just got himself fired for mouthing off. There s no getting around it   the first amendment does not guarantee the freedom to speak without consequences. And really, that s fine by me,  he continued. So no   I m not going to share my personal feelings about Charlottesville, President Trump, or the current effort to remove thousands of statues of long dead soldiers from the public square. Not just because it s  bad for business,  but because it s annoying. I can t think of a single celebrity whose political opinion I value, and I m not going to assume the country feels any differently about mine,  Rowe wrote.  So, rather than blow myself up, or chime in with all the obvious observations about the cowardly scum in the pointy hats, I m going to talk instead about my belief that comments like yours pose a far greater threat to the future of our country than the existence of a memorial to Thomas Jefferson, or a monument to George Washington. Ready? Then Rowe started in on Adkins  insinuations. You say that White Nationalists believe that everyone who goes to college is an  academic elite.  You then say that Republicans promote  anti-intellectualism.  You offer no proof to support either claim, but it really doesn t matter   your statements successfully connect two radically different organizations by alleging a shared belief,  Rowe said.  Thus, White Nationalists and The Republican Party suddenly have something in common   a contempt for higher education. Then, you make it personal. You say that Republicans  love  me because they believe that my initiative and  their  initiative are one and the same. But of course,  their  initiative is now the same initiative as White Nationalists. He continued  Very clever. Without offering a shred of evidence, you ve implied that Republicans who support mikeroweWORKS do so because they believe I share their disdain for all things  intellectual.  And poof   just like that, Republicans, White Nationalists, and mikeroweWORKS are suddenly conflated, and the next thing you know, I m off on a press tour to disavow rumors of my troubling association with the Nazis! Far-fetched? Far from it,  Rowe continued.  That s how logical fallacies work. A flaw in reasoning or a mistaken belief undermines the logic of a conclusion, often leading to real-world consequences. And right now, logical fallacies are not limited to the warped beliefs of morons with tiki torches, and other morons calling for  more dead cops.  Logical fallacies are everywhere. Not near done, Rowe wrote,  As I type this, a Democrat on CNN is making an argument that says,  because Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, those Republicans now opposed to tearing down his memorial are  pro-slavery,  and therefore aligned with the modern day KKK.  That s a logical fallacy. Over on Fox, a Republican is arguing that  any Democrat who has not yet condemned the Senator from Missouri for publicly wishing that Donald Trump be assassinated, is guilty of wishing for the exact same thing.  That s a logical fallacy. Yesterday, on The Science Channel, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, a noted astronomer, tweeted that the ability of scientists to accurately predict the solar eclipse, was proof that predictions of global warming were also accurate. That s a logical fallacy. Then Rowe turned the tables on his accuser, continuing,  Want to hear another one? Imagine something like this, unfolding over on MSNBC. Good Evening, America, our top story tonight  Chuck Atkins is a racist! Why? Because he can t spell. Just look at his grammar! In a recent post on Mike Rowe s Facebook page, Mr. Atkins, while bemoaning America s global academic standing, not only misspelled  elitist,  he used  tenants  when he meant  tenets.  He neglected to use a hyphen in  anti-intellectual,  and he misplaced several commas and apostrophes! But why is he a racist, you ask? Simple. Because everyone knows racists are ignorant. Chuck Atkins is clearly a poor speller. Poor spelling and grammar are signs of ignorance. Ergo   Chuck Atkins is a racist! Boom! The matter is settled! There s not much we can do about the news, but here on Facebook, I think we can do better. This isn t Twitter,  Rowe said.  We re not limited to a few inflammatory sentences and a flurry of emojis. Take a moment, Chuck. Think. Make a rational argument. Otherwise, just link us to a cat video. People love those, and they re almost never  bad for business.  (Unless of course, the cat gets hurt. People hate that.) Just don t assume that people will care about your beliefs, if you re not willing to back them up with some relevant facts and a rational conclusion. Here, for instance, are a few facts that matter to me, with respect to my foundation and the recurring charge of  fostering anti-intellectualism. Rowe then defended his charitable work, writing,  mikeroweWORKS is a PR campaign for the skilled trades. For the last nine years, we ve partnered with numerous trade schools, raised millions of dollars for work-ethic scholarships, and called attention to millions of jobs that don t require a four-year degree. But that doesn t mean we re  anti-intellectual.  We re not even  anti-college.  We simply reject the popular notion that a four-year degree is the best path for the most people. And we re hardly alone. Millions of reasonable people   Republicans and Democrats alike   are worried that our universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world. They re worried about activist professors, safe spaces, the rising cost of tuition, a growing contempt for history, and a simmering disregard of the first amendment. These people are concerned that our universities   once beacons of free speech   now pander to a relatively small percentage of students who can t tolerate any political opinion that challenges their own. And they re concerned   deeply concerned   that millions of good jobs are currently vacant that don t require a four-year degree, or any of the catastrophic debt that comes with it. Returning to the original attack, Rowe concluded,  Again   these are not the concerns of  anti-intellectuals.  They are the concerns of people who care about the future of the country. I don t know how many of these people are Republicans, but I can assure you that no one who actually supports my initiative is remotely confused about my feelings on education, because I ve been crystal clear on that topic from the very beginning. To quote Thomas Jefferson, (while I still can,)  If a nation expects to be ignorant and free and live in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.  On this point, my foundation does not equivocate. In other words, Chuck, I have no idea what The White Nationalists think about my efforts, or the Republicans, the Democrats, the elitists, the Italians, the Presbyterians, the unions, or the self-proclaimed anti-intellectuals. And really, I couldn t care less. My question is, why do you? Mike PS. Ok, I ve just re-read this, (in a desperate search for typos,) and I want to apologize for pointing out that you re a lousy speller. This is probably not the time to trot out The Grammar Nazi, but your tenor and tone pissed me off, and I responded in my own snarky way. Sorry,  he wrote. PPS Maybe this is how political correctness begins? Maybe we start by correcting each other s grammar, and then move on to the business of correcting everything else? Today a missing hyphen, tomorrow a missing monument. Or, maybe not,  he concluded.",politics,"Aug 23, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
MEDIA GOES CRAZY Over Hillary Wishing She Would Have Told Trump: “Back Up Creep!” For Standing Too Close During Debates…Remained Silent When ACTUAL CREEPS Preyed On Any Female Within Arms Reach,"The media is in an all out frenzy today, as they attempt to help pump up the sales of the horribly flawed presidential candidate and Benghazi liar, Crooked Hillary, while attempting to trash our beloved president.

Heitkamp hails from another deep-red state   North Dakota went for Trump by about 36 points.Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) Republicans have a lot to like about their Montana prospects.

WATCH KARMA IN ACTION: CNN GETS HIT With Tear Gas While Defending Violent Alt-Left Protesters At AZ Trump Rally,"The timing couldn t have been better. Just as Gary Tuckman, a reporter for Very Fake News CNN, was in the middle of a hit piece on President Trump, he was literally hit with tear gas being used by law enforcement to keep the radical Alt-Left protesters from harming innocent people who came to support our president at his Phoenix, AZ rally last night.Very Fake News CNN s Gary Tuckman, can be seen clearly struggling to speak to CNN host Don Lemon in the video below.Tuckman told Very Fake News CNN host Don Lemon,  All of our faces are burning, all of our throats are burning.   He also relayed what was very likely bad intel, to Lemon: There were some water bottles thrown at police and the next thing we felt were the burning tear gas.  But how does Tuckman know they were they bottles filled with water? The radical, and very violent Antifa group that CNN is working so hard to redefine as a kinder, gentler resistance group, was accused of throwing bottles of urine at free speech advocates and law enforcement in Charlottesville less than 2 weeks ago. So how does Tuckman know for certain that the bottles the  non-violent  group he is so quick to defend, were only filled with water? And since when is lobbing ANYTHING at police officers who are protecting our president and his supporters considered NON-violent?Earlier in the evening, another CNN reporter nearly got hit by the lit end of a smoke grenade.CNN may want to rethink this whole bunkering with Antifa thing during what appears to be ongoing, violent protests by the Democrat Partys  Soros funded Alt-Left groups.The Alt-Left came prepared last night, as they were seen proudly displaying their AR-15 s.",politics,"Aug 23, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

WATCH: MASSIVE Crowd Of Supporters Line Streets In Phoenix For Trump Rally….Supporters Chant: “WE LOVE TRUMP!”…”PEACE AND LOVE!”…While Alt-Left Protesters Carry AR-15’s To Rally…Bikers 4 Trump Pray For Peace," In the months and even weeks leading up the 2016 presidential election, so many Americans were fearful that the polls were correct. They worried that Hillary might actually be our next president. We warned people to ignore the polls and to ignore the leftist media. We told them the Democrat Party media was only trying to create the illusion that most Americans wouldn t vote for Donald J. Trump to demoralize his base. We implored voters to pay attention to the size of the crowds showing up for his rallies. We explained to them that the reason violent protests were breaking out at his rallies was because they were trying to distract from the truth about the massive numbers of Americans who were showing up to support candidate Trump.Nothing much has changed since the election, except for the level of vitriol and hate by Democrats who were blindsided by the media who promised them Hillary would win. Meanwhile, throngs of people are still showing up to attend President Trump s rallies. His supporters vehemently defend him on social media, and if their brave enough, his supporters may even admit to their friends or co-workers that they admire him for keeping his promises to them.It s been 7 months since President Trump s inauguration and the media is still up to their same dirty tricks. The media recently published a poll showing support for President Trump dropping. They continue to tell their viewers that Trump is wildly unpopular with Americans.Trump s rally tonight in Phoenix, AZ should silence some of the critics:Here s one of Trump s most vocal supporters, Scott Presler, who  showed up at the Phoenix rally tonight. Scott also happens to be a proud gay man.

"WATCH: SMARTPHONE CAPTURES NEW BOATLOAD OF “Scared, Hungry Women and Children” On Their Way To Europe…While 6.6 MILLION More Are Waiting To Cross","Ask your liberal friends to tell you more about these  poor women and children  who are fleeing persecution from radical Islamists in the Middle East The recent surge of migration into Europe has been unprecedented in scope, with an estimated 1 million migrants from the Middle East and North Africa this past year alone, making for a massive humanitarian crisis, as well as a political and moral dilemma for European governments. But one crucial dimension of this crisis has gone little-noticed: sex or, more technically, sex ratios.According to official counts, a disproportionate number of these migrants are young, unmarried, unaccompanied males. In fact, the sex ratios among migrants are so one-sided we re talking worse than those in China, in some cases that they could radically change the gender balance in European countries in certain age cohorts.  PoliticoA leaked German government report has warned, that up to 6.6 million people are waiting in countries around the Mediterranean to cross into Europe, according to details of the classified report leaked to Bild newspaper.Here s a video that s being circulated on social media today, of a boatload of young, male immigrants who are speaking Arabic as they record their trip on a smartphone. Note to bleeding heart liberals: These are clearly not impoverished men or women and children who are escaping persecution by Islamic extremists.New boatload of scared/hungry women and children on their way to Europe. At least they had their smart phone to document the journey. pic.twitter.com/svLUy6mO9K  Based Monitored   (@BasedMonitored) August 22, 2017The high percentage of young males flooding European countries will soon be a very serious problem:Politico   As many governments, including in the United States, debate how many migrants to accept onto their shores, they would be wise to take gender balance into consideration. That might sound sexist on the surface, but years of research has shown that male-dominated societies are less stable, because they are more susceptible to higher levels of violence, insurgence and mistreatment of women. In Germany, scores of women recently reported being attacked on New Year s Eve by men whom the authorities describe as of  North African or Arabic  descent. While it is not yet known whether the alleged perpetrators were migrants, the attacks may finally be alerting policymakers to the risks of a male-dominated migration wave.Why would European societies, many of which rank highest on global measures of gender equality and stability and peace, jeopardize those hard-won and enviable rankings?That imbalance might not sound radical, but it is, especially when you look more closely at who those males are. It s true that many male migrants hope that, if granted asylum, they will be joined in Europe by their wives and children, who would help balance out national sex ratios. But importantly, more than 20 percent of migrants are minors below the age of 18, and the IOM estimates that more than half of those minors traveling to Europe are traveling as unaccompanied minors 90 percent of whom are males. This heavily male subset is all but guaranteed asylum because of their status as unaccompanied minors, but they get no special dispensation to bring spouses, especially since the European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that European Union countries are not required to recognize the legality of child marriages among migrants.

In addition to organizing mass protests outside the rally, Indivisible is encouraging protesters to register for tickets for the rally itself, increasing the likelihood that protesters will disrupt Trump s speech, as often happens at Trump s rallies.Although originally founded by activists not backed by donors, Indivisible s website now states that the group  is a project of the Advocacy Fund,  a progressive advocacy group that receives money from the Open Society Policy Center, an arm of Soros  Open Society Foundations. That revelation follows USA Today s reporting in May that leaders of Indivisible and Women s March met with Democracy Alliance, a Soros-led network of left-wing donors, to discuss funding options.VIA: DAILY CALLERVia: Truthfeed",politics,"Aug 22, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
TWISTED LIBERAL KINDERGARTEN Teacher Allows Transgender Student To “REVEAL” Her “TRUE GENDER” To Class,"Silly parents you don t get to decide if, or when to talk to your kids about the .03% of the population who consider themselves to be  transgender.  And oh yeah your kids teacher will also inform your child that the gender they re born with doesn t matter, and that they can actually choose the gender they identify with.  Because liberal educators know better than you what s best for your child.The Rocklin Academy school board is facing tough questions from parents concerned over a controversial incident involving transgender discussions inside a kindergarten class. These parents feel betrayed by the school district that they were not notified,  said Karen England with the Capitol Resource Institute.WATCH:The incident happened earlier this summer during the last few days of the academic school year.At Monday night s board meeting, the teacher at the center of the controversy spoke out. With emotions high, she addressed a packed house. I m so proud of my students, it was never my intent to harm any students but to help them through a difficult situation,  she said.The teacher defended her actions to read two children s books about transgenderism including one titled  I am Jazz.  She says the books were given to her by a transgender child going through a transition. The kindergartners came home very confused, about whether or not you can pick your gender, whether or not they really were a boy or a girl,  said England.And many parents say they feel betrayed and blindsided. I want her to hear from me as a parent what her gender identity means to her and our family, not from a book that may be controversial,  a parent said. My daughter came home crying and shaking so afraid she could turn into a boy,  another parent said.The issue was not on the agenda, so parents spoke out during public comment. It s really about the parents being informed and involved and giving us the choice and rights of what s being introduced to our kids, and at what age,  said parent Chelsea McQuistan.Many teachers also spoke out in support of what transpired inside the classroom. They spoke about the importance of teaching students about diversity and having healthy dialogues.Unlike sex education, the topics of gender identity don t require prior parental notice.

"BOOM! CAMPING WORLD CEO TELLS TRUMP SUPPORTERS To Shop Elsewhere…NASCAR Legend Cancels $150,000 Order","Marcus Lemonis has no problem with some customers taking their RV and outdoor needs elsewhere. Close followers of NASCAR know Lemonis, CEO of Camping World, is a major player in the sport. His brand is the title sponsor of the truck racing series, while its subsidiary Overton s has sponsored multiple races and cars this season.Amid the flood of CEOs rushing to distance themselves from Trump s business councils after the U.S. president s wishy-washy denunciation of white supremacy last weekend, Lemonis on Wednesday appeared on CNBC s  Power Lunch,  where he seemed to suggest he wouldn t be shattered if people who supported Trump s comments decided to shop elsewhere. Marcus, you have a consumer-facing business, Camping World,  CNBC s Michelle Caruso-Cabrera asked.  So do you worry about, if you were on one of these councils, would you worry, thinking, wow, I ve got to deal with consumers every day, are they going to look at the business poorly because I m associated with the White House?  Lemonis  response:  There s no doubt that there is probably not many consumers in this country today that are in favor of what has been said in the last couple days   and if they are, frankly, don t shop at my business. Lemonis hasn t been shy about criticizing Trump and NASCAR chairman Brian France   who last year endorsed Donald Trump for president, for their past political views. He ripped France for endorsing Trump at a rally during last year s presidential election, and NASCAR was forced to move its postseason truck series banquet from Trump National Doral Miami resort in 2015 after Lemonis threatened not to attend.

Do you have any idea of the number of attacks? You might be shocked to see the list created by The Daily Caller.We feel like it s even more important to know who s behind the effort to attack and silence conservatives in America. There are groups like MoveOn.org and Black Lives Matter that have been instigating violence in a big way. Antifa is the worst with their tactics of extreme violence and destruction.Just as destructive as the violence is the left s effort to hijack the narrative anytime something happens between both sides. It s an Alinsky tactic that the left has been using long before President Trump came on the scene. The only difference now is that they re on overdrive with the attacks on Trump! It s downright scary!Take the The Huffington Post s recent article calling for the execution of Trump and  everyone assisting his agenda. If you ve noticed a hijacking of the narrative on just about everything to do with President Trump then look no further than the attack on his comments yesterday.

CHAOS AND MOB RULE at Charlottesville City Council Meeting: “That’s not the rules!” [Video],"This is mob rule AGAIN! The best part of this video is when Mayor Mike Signer says  that s not the rules He must not have been watching the news lately. The rules don t apply to these kooks.This is like a bunch of toddlers who are warned over and over to stop misbehaving. Is this what America wants? We hope people on all sides see how horrible this is!It s hard to feel sorry for the mayor and city council when they supported this mayhem. The real culprit in all this is their governor. Perhaps they should go visit him to ask questions about what he did to turn the rally/ protest into a violent riot.OUR LATEST ON THE VIRGINIA GOVERNOR: Why did the Democrat VA Governor throw gasoline on the fire after violent protests broke out in Charlottesville? Why did the radical Democrat governor of Virginia LIE about weapons being stashed around the city of Charlottesville prior to the march? Was he just doing his part as a prominent member of the Democrat Party to help create more racial division in America? Why did he lie about Virginia police officers being underprepared for the violence and chaos that took place, when police officers claim they were completely prepared? Was he trying to shine a negative light on the police force assigned to Charlottesville, as part of the Democrat Party s ongoing plan to undermine the credibility of our law enforcement?Last week, Virginia police officers were speaking out, and setting  the record straight. They were not about to remain silent while their governor made up stories to boost his party s race dividing, cop-hating narrative.Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas is not just sitting around and wondering how the Clinton bestie was able to get away with lying about what happened in Charlottesville, while the media ignored Governor McAuliffe s part in inciting violence.Sunday on Fox News Channel s  Fox & Friends Weekend,  Gohmert called for a Department of Justice investigation of Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-VA) and Charlottesville, VA Mayor Michael Signer for possibly facilitating the violence that took place in Charlottesville earlier this month.Gohmert said,  The way forward s not gonna be easy. And I think the Justice Department needs a full investigation of the governor, of the mayor. They said in court there would be violence at Charlottesville, and then the witnesses and the photographs show they herded these groups to create violence so they could brag. We need a Justice Department investigation into Kessler. You don t just go all of a sudden from having multiracial roommates and a Jewish girlfriend to all of a sudden being a white supremacist that wants to join the Republican party. There s something very, very wrong in all of this. He added,  Like they were the violence at Trump events, they may have been behind this violence getting started. They facilitated it, anyway.  -Breitbart ",politics,"Aug 22, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
ALT-LEFT PLANS TO HIJACK PRESIDENT TRUMP’S AZ RALLY…Will He Really Make Them Crazy By Announcing Pardon For America’s Toughest Sheriff on Illegal Immigration?,"The pieces are in place ahead of President Donald Trump s rally in downtown Phoenix on Tuesday, with the nation waiting to see how it will play out.Officials are bracing for a deluge of tens of thousands of supporters and protesters, leading law enforcement to close roads and also for many businesses, offices, schools and even state courts to close their doors early.Although Trump visited Arizona seven times during his campaign, this is his first visit as president and likely to be a very different affair.  AZ CentralOn August 14, President Trump on Tuesday retweeted a Fox News story saying he was  seriously considering  pardoning former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio.FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: President Trump 'seriously considering' a pardon for ex-Sheriff Joe Arpaio https://t.co/Rgw8l7i9Xl  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) August 14, 2017President Trump may soon issue a pardon for Joe Arpaio, the colorful former Arizona sheriff who was found guilty two weeks ago of criminal contempt for defying a state judge s order to stop traffic patrols targeting suspected undocumented immigrants. In his final years as Maricopa County sheriff, Arpaio had emerged as a leading opponent of illegal immigration. I am seriously considering a pardon for Sheriff Arpaio,  the president said Sunday, during a conversation with Fox News at his club in Bedminster, N.J.  He has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration. He s a great American patriot and I hate to see what has happened to him. Trump said the pardon could happen in the next few days, should he decide to do so.Arpaio, 85, was convicted by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton of misdemeanor contempt of court for willfully disregarding an Arizona judge s order in 2011 to stop the anti-immigrant traffic patrols. Arpaio had maintained the law enforcement patrols for 17 months thereafter.The man who built a controversial national reputation as  America s toughest sheriff  admitted he prolonged his patrols, but insisted he did not intend to break the law because one of his former attorneys did not explain to him the full measure of restrictions contained in the court order.He is expected to be sentenced on Oct. 5 and could face up to six months in jail. However, since he is 85 years old and has no prior convictions, some attorneys doubt he will receive any jail time.Citing his long service as  an outstanding sheriff,  the president said Arpaio is admired by many Arizona citizens who respected his tough-on-crime approach.Arpaio s widely publicized tactics included forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and housing them in desert tent camps where temperatures often climbed well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit. He also controversially brought back chain gains, including a voluntary chain gang for women prisoners.

PATRIOT ARTIST’S LATEST TRIBUTE TO TRUMP SUPPORTERS: “You Are Not forgotten” [Video],"Patriot artist John McNaughton just revealed his latest painting A tribute to the middle class and Trump supporters who are the forgotten people of America Remember when McNaughton revealed the painting during Obamas s presidency that depicted the president burning the Constitution?  ONE NATION UNDER SOCIALISM PLEASE CHECK OUT:  JOHN MCNAUGHTON FINE ART THE FORGOTTEN MAN    OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THAT INCREDIBLE PAINTING: John McNaughton is a special American painter because of his subject matter and the intensity in which he portrays our current government troubled and corrupt. The Forgotten Man painting is amazing in its symbolism.Here s how McNaughton describes the painting:Against the background of a darkening sky, all of the past Presidents of the United States gather before the White House, as if to commemorate some great event. In the left hand corner of the painting sits a man. That man, with his head bowed appears distraught and hopeless as he contemplates his future. Some of the past Presidents try to console him while looking in the direction of the modern Presidents as if to say,  What have you done?  Many of these modern Presidents, seemingly oblivious to anything other than themselves, appear to be congratulating each other on their great accomplishments. In front of the man, paper trash is blowing in the wind. Crumpled dollar bills, legislative documents, and, like a whisper the U.S. Constitution beneath the foot of Barack Obama.THE FORGOTTEN MAN McNaughton never sells his original paintings BUT he made an exception this time. He sold this painting to Sean Hannity so Hannity could give it to Donald Trump. Awesome, huh?November 9th McNaughton announced via facebook that he sold the original to Sean Hannity: Sean Hannity just purchased my painting  The Forgotten Man  to give to Donald Trump to hang in the White House Go to www.jonmcnaughton.comVia: Conservative Treehouse",politics,"Aug 21, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
CHELSEA CLINTON Uses “Lucifer” To Support Argument For Tearing Down Confederate Statues…INSTANTLY Regrets It,"Chelsea Clinton thought she was quite clever when she cited the  story of Lucifer  to support her argument for removing confederate statues. What is it about the Clinton s citing anything to do with faith to support their argument that makes everyone cringe?The story of Lucifer-who rebelled against God-is part of many Christians' traditions. I've never been in a church with a Lucifer statue.  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) August 18, 2017We all know that the Clinton s have no boundaries when it comes to making up lies to fit their narrative, but after Chelsea attempted to convince Twitter users that she is a regular church-goer, we couldn t help but remind everyone what Chelsea openly admitted while she was pregnant with her second child:Because every 6-year old makes the decision to leave a church over their views on abortion right? And every pregnant mother reminisces about leaving the church over their defense of killing unborn babies right?But you left church when you were 6 because you supported abortion, remember? https://t.co/uNKP979Zly    Golden Gnome   (@memealchemy) August 18, 2017 Fairy Sweet Dee  delivered a left hook to the phony Chelsea, as she reminded her Twitter followers what Democrats really believe: .prob not but I'm sure you would have tried to coerce Mary into aborting since she was a low income unwed mother. https://t.co/5p4tNjgxlV  Sweetest Dee (@ihate_everyone2) August 18, 2017Twitter users really came at Chelsea hard. Much like her crooked mother, Crooked Chelsea continued to make up stories to prove her point.

MUSLIM PROFESSOR A NO-SHOW AT LECTURE: Afraid to be Called Out Again On Teaching Sharia Practice of Cutting off Hands is Good [Video],"Recall that in 2016 a Muslim professor was caught on video [see below] explaining why cutting off hands as punishment for theft is a good punishment. Bassam Alhalabi believes in Sharia law and was explaining why it s such a great idea and that it would cut down on crime. Here s the video below:JUST TO BE CLEAR   THIS MAN BELIEVES IT S OK TO CHOP OFF HANDS!  Where there is no Sharia, Islamic Sharia, they die in dozens and hundreds every day because of organized crime. People kill people, other people or steal pizza for $10 and so   so when Islamic Shariah is saying about capital punishment   so even though it sounds like it is severe but if that is the solution to prevent any crimes, then it still has a lot of rules and regulations. I will just mention one and stop here, which is let s say cutting off the hands of a person if they steal. It sounds very severe. It sounds very barbaric, I know. But if takes one or two people to have their hands cut off, and then there s no more stealing and there s no more stealing in the whole nation   that s a much better resolution than having hundreds of people die every day. RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY! THE PROFESSOR HIGHTAILED IT OUT OF THERE WHEN HE SAW UNITED WEST THERE TO RECORD HIM AGAIN!On August 17, 2017 Florida Atlantic University (FAU) Professor and President of the Islamic Society of Boca Raton, FL, Bassem Alhalabi, agreed to publicly defend the Shariah Islamiyya (Islamic Law) but ran away in shame from the venue minutes before the programs starting time.The title of the meeting was,  Interfaith Cafe: Sharia Law and U.S. Law Nothing To Fear.  Dr. Alhalabi was to defend Islamic law, making the case that we non-Muslims have nothing to fear from Shariah.Deep down Dr. Alhalabi knows the facts are not on his side. I suspect what Dr. Alhalabi fears most are Americans who are educated on Islamic Law and use Islamic sources with consensus/Ijma to distinguish his lies from truth.When those knowledgeable people from The United West showed up to film, Dr. Alhalabi ran out of the venue faster than you can say chop chop adios. Dr. Alhalabi left his audience and event organizers dumbfounded. We suspect the fear that he d be caught on video again might be the reason why.Via: Dr. Rich Swier",politics,"Aug 21, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"WOW! SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR Sets Record Straight, After USA TODAY Attempts To Make Readers Believe President Trump Is Draining Secret Service Funds Dry","USA Today published an article today that was so egregiously misleading that every hotel that leaves this joke of a publication outside the doors for their guests to read, should be ashamed to be peddling such trash. (Even if it is free..and we all know what they say:  If it s free It s  free  for a reason .) USA Today is one of the most virulently anti-Trump publications you will find anywhere. Much like the morning shows, whose morning talk hosts greet their viewers with cheerful dispositions and big white smiles, while sticking daggers into our president and his family, USA Today can be found as in almost every hotel in America as a complimentary source of news for their guests.USA Today comes across to the everyday American as a friendly publication that gives Americans a snapshot into the latest national news without any bias. Unfortunately, nothing could be further than the truth. USA Today s stories are so anti-Trump, they should almost come with a warning label for anyone who s looking for honest journalism and unbiased news.An article that appeared today, in the USA Today talked about the dire financial situation that President Trump and his family have caused with their  with an unprecedented number of White House protectees. Shortly after the article was published, Secret Service Director Randolph  Tex  Alles released a statement refuting what USA Today claimed he said. The quotes in red in the USA Today article below are from the Secret Service Director s statement.USA Today   The Secret Service can no longer pay hundreds of agents it needs to carry out an expanded protective mission   in large part due to the sheer size of President Trump s family and efforts necessary to secure their multiple residences up and down the East Coast.Here s what Secret Service Director Randolph  Tex  Alles said about the Secret Service running out of money: The Secret Service has the funding it needs to meet all current mission requirements for the remainder of the fiscal year and compensate employees for overtime within statutory pay caps. Secret Service Director Randolph  Tex  Alles, in an interview with USA TODAY, said more than 1,000 agents have already hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire year.OOPS! It looks like the same thing happened in 2016 while  Barack Obama was President: The Secret Service estimates that roughly 1,100 employees will work overtime hours in excess of statutory pay caps during calendar year 2017. Our agency experienced a similar situation in calendar year 2016 that resulted in legislation that allowed Secret Service employees to exceed statutory caps on pay.The agency has faced a crushing workload since the height of the contentious election season, and it has not relented in the first seven months of the administration. Agents must protect Trump   who has traveled almost every weekend to his properties in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia   and his adult children whose business trips and vacations have taken them across the country and overseas.To remedy this ongoing and serious problem, the agency has worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security, the Administration, and the Congress over the past several months to find a legislative solution. As we work to ensure that employees are compensated for the hours they work, the Secret Service continues its rigorous hiring of special agents, Uniformed Division officers, and critical support staff to meet future mission requirements. The president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law,  Alles said.  I can t change that. I have no flexibility. The law, Title 18 US Code 3056, details protection requirements for the President, Vice President and their immediate family members.Alles said the service is grappling with an unprecedented number of White House protectees. Under Trump, 42 people have protection, a number that includes 18 members of his family. That s up from 31 during the Obama administration.Does USA Today really believe the average American is so stupid that they ve already forgotten about the several separate vacations that the former first lady took while her husband golfed almost every weekend that he was in office? What about her notorious trip to Spain where she brought most of her entire  friends and family list  courtesy of the American taxpayers?The people you see surrounding former First Lady Michele Obama on her luxury African Safari are Michelle s family members. Yes, the American taxpayer paid for her luxury African Safari with her brother, cousins and of course, her mother, who lived in the White House for Barack s entire 8-year term, and traveled to all of their overseas destinations courtesy of, you guessed it, the American taxpayer.Surely USA Today doesn t believe we ve already forgotten about Barack Obama s obsession with golf, that more than one time, took him and his lovely wife to opposite sides of the country to satisfy their individual 5-star travel needs:Overwork and constant travel have also been driving a recent exodus from the Secret Service ranks, yet without congressional intervention to provide additional funding, Alles will not even be able to pay agents for the work they have already done.The compensation crunch is so serious that the director has begun discussions with key lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents, from $160,000 per year to $187,000 for at least the duration of Trump s first term.But even if such a proposal was approved, about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed, according to the agency. And finally, the same Secret Service Director Randolph  Tex  Alles who allegedly gave USA Today the  exclusive  scoop about how the Trump family were draining the Secret Service funds dry, concluded his statement with this:This issue is not one that can be attributed to the current Administration s protection requirements alone, but rather has been an ongoing issue for nearly a decade due to an overall increase in operational tempo.This isn t the first time USA Today was caught fabricating a story to make President Trump look bad to their readers. In April of 2017, USA TODAY was caught fabricating a story about an innocent  Dreamer  being deported.

WATCH SOLAR ECLIPSE LIVE HERE,"If you don t have the proper glasses to watch the historic solar eclipse today, you can still watch it here LIVE as it happens.From NASA: Solar Eclipse 2017 On August 21, 2017, all of North America will be treated to an eclipse of the sun. Viewers around the world will be provided a wealth of images captured before, during, and after the eclipse by 11 spacecraft, at least three NASA aircraft, more than 50 high-altitude balloons, and the astronauts aboard the International Space Station   each offering a unique vantage point for the celestial event.Watch here:https://t.co/oYED98vQyL  Twitter News (@TwitterNews) August 16, 2017Where Can You See It? You can see a partial eclipse, where the moon covers only a part of the sun, anywhere in North America (see  Who can see it? ). To see a total eclipse, where the moon fully covers the sun for a short few minutes, you must be in the path of totality. The path of totality is a relatively thin ribbon, around 70 miles wide, that will cross the U.S. from West to East. The first point of contact will be at Lincoln Beach, Oregon at 9:05 a.m. PDT. Totality begins there at 10:16 a.m. PDT. Over the next hour and a half, it will cross through Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and North and South Carolina. The total eclipse will end near Charleston, South Carolina at 2:48 p.m. EDT. From there the lunar shadow leaves the United States at 4:09 EDT. Its longest duration will be near Carbondale, Illinois, where the sun will be completely covered for two minutes and 40 seconds.If you missed the eclipse as it happened, here are a couple of incredible videos that were taken of the eclipse: More of the moon crossing in front of sun in Philly: https://t.co/fKHeCFSNKf #SolarEclipse2017   pic.twitter.com/fjxfUuxOy6  NBC10 Philadelphia (@NBCPhiladelphia) August 21, 2017#SolarEclipse2017 Breathtaking! pic.twitter.com/fvPwGwgn99   smail H.

"WATCH: DEMOCRAT STATE SENATOR Who Said She Wouldn’t Apologize For Saying She Wished President Trump Would Be Assassinated, Makes Tearful Apology","Last week, MO State Senator Chappelle-Nadal said she hoped  Trump would be assassinated  on her Facebook page. Thepost referring to President Donald Trump, has since been removed. But Chappelle-Nadal confirmed to the Post-Dispatch that she had written it in response to another commenter before deleting it.The U.S. Secret Service s St. Louis field office  is looking into this,  the office confirmed.Kristina Schmidt, special agent in charge, told the Post-Dispatch that  hypothetically  in such investigations, agents try to  determine intent, to determine if there was a violation of federal law. If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. Attorney. Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it,  Schmidt said.According to a screenshot of the now-deleted conversation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, another commenter named Christopher Gagn  was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trump s Secret Service detail.Here is a screen shot of the post that Chappelle-Nadal deleted after she was outed on social media:After Chappelle-Nadal was criticized by thousands of Americans, she still refused to back down and told the media she would not apologize to President Trump for the heinous remarks she made.After some members (not all) of the Democrat Party suggested she should step down from her position as state senator, Maria Chappelle-Nadal suddenly had a change of heart.

LEFTY MEDIA Uses #SolarEclipse To Make Case For Why They Still Believe Clinton Won…Still Not Over The Election?,"Oh my! The lefty Boston Globe is using the 2017 Solar Eclipse to make a case for a Clinton presidential win. The over-the-top article goes out of its way to make the claim that Trump lost to Clinton It s delusional and twisted that the Globe would use an article about the eclipse to continue down this path of delusion The Globe asked: : Is the eclipse throwing shade at Clinton supporters?The path of ideal viewing spots for this month s highly-anticipated total solar eclipse cuts overwhelmingly through places that voted for President Trump in November.IT STARTS OUT NICE ENOUGH TO TRUMP BUT THEN IT S  WHAM! THEY PIVOT TO MAKE THE CASE FOR HOW THEY SILL BELIEVE CLINTON WON IN 2016!And about 92 percent of those counties swung in Trump s favor, while fewer than two dozen counties voted for his opponent, Hillary Clinton.Trump won many of those counties by a wide margin, securing an average of 71 percent of the vote in counties he won along the path. Clinton, by comparison, got only about 56 percent of the vote in counties she won along the eclipse path.And of the more than 6.2 million votes cast in those counties for one of those two candidates, 59 percent were for Trump, while 41 percent were for Clinton.That stands in stark contrast to the overall results of the 2016 election, in which about 51 percent of votes cast for either candidate went to Clinton, while about 49 percent went to Trump.The eclipse on Aug. 21 will be visible to people across the United States, but in most areas, the view will be of a partial eclipse. People will only be able to see a total eclipse if they re located along the  path of totality,  which will start near Lincoln City, Ore., and end near Charleston, S.C.Still, it s not entirely surprising that the eclipse s path of best perspective could slice through the entire country while mostly avoiding areas that backed Clinton.WHAM! THE CASE IS MADE FOR WHY THEY STILL BELIEVE CLINTON WON! While she won the popular vote, Trump won the Electoral College and about 84 percent of the country s 3,100-plus counties.Clinton won more voters overall because she captured densely populated urban areas, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Boston. Trump, by contrast, won many rural areas with small populations.FUN FACT OF THE DAY Perhaps it s not a surprise that the solar eclipse is passing over Trump strongholds given that the president himself was born during a lunar eclipse.On June 14, 1946, the day Trump was born, there was a total lunar eclipse, though it wasn t visible from the United States, NASA records show. Instead, it could be seen from parts of South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia.THE LIBERAL MEDIA IS STILL FIGHTING THE FIGHT WE CAN T WAIT UNTIL TRUMP2020!WE JUST WANT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT:Overall Trump won approximately 2,600 counties to Clinton s 500, or about 84% of the geographic United States. However, Clinton won 88 of of the 100 largest counties (including Washington D.C.). Without these 100 largest counties she would have lost by 11.5 million votes.TRUMP=RED    CLINTON=BLUEVIA: WKI",politics,"Aug 21, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

"DISGUSTING! UNEMPLOYED, RACE-OBSESSED Colin Kaepernick Will Be Added To Smithsonian Black History Museum, While Conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas Is BLACKLISTED","Few people, if any, keep track of ratings or public approval numbers for the Smithsonian. However, if they did, those numbers would soon go down dramatically. Why? Because the man who single-handedly accomplished the nearly impossible feat of turning America against its favorite game, is about to get his own exhibit.Most fans were not impressed with Kaepernick s disrespect of our American flag and of our national anthem. According to curators at the museum, currently unemployed NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick is about to get his own display at the Smithsonian s National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall.In fact, museum officials have already begun requesting various items of significance from Kaepernick s protests of last year.According to the Washington Examiner,  Artifacts from former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick s national anthem protests will reportedly soon be on display at the Black Lives Matter collection at the Smithsonian s National Museum of African American History. The National Museum of African American History and Culture has nearly 40,000 items in our collection,  said Damion Thomas, the museum s sports curator, to USA Today.  The Colin Kaepernick collection is in line with the museum s larger collecting efforts to document the varied areas of society that have been impacted by the Black Lives Matter movement. Incredibly, as pointed out by IJR and The Washington Times, the museum extends Kaepernick this honor while only mentioning African-American Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in connection with the sexual harassment charge brought against him by Anita Hill.  BrietbartI was opposed to welfare because I had seen its destructive effects up close in Savannah. Most of the older people among whom I had grown up felt as I did, sharing Daddy s belief that it would be the  ruination  of blacks, undermining their desire to wor & provide for themselves. I added that my own sister was a victim of the system, which had created a sense of entitlement that had trapped her and her children. I went on to say that I opposed busing, preferring to give school vouchers to poor children. Source: My Grandfather s Son: A Memoir by Clarence Thomas, p. 132-3 , Oct 1, 2007Quotes like the one above from Clarence Thomas have made him a target of the left. It really doesn t matter what color you are, if you don t tow the entitlement line that keeps you in the good graces of the Democrat Party, you will be punished. In Clarence Thomas  case, the punishment is that he will likely never see himself featured in the Smithsonian Black History museum.Here is a short biography of Clarence Thomas, that illustrates the unimaginable odds he overcame  to become a US Supreme Court Justice:Clarence Thomas was born in the tiny coastal town of Pin Point, Georgia, on June 23, 1948. As a very young boy he lived in a one-room shack with dirt floors and no plumbing. When Thomas was two years old, his father walked out on the family. As a result, at the age of seven he and his younger brother were sent to live with their grandfather, Myers Anderson, and his wife in Savannah, Georgia. Anderson, a devout Catholic and active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sent Thomas to a Catholic school staffed by nuns.In remarks reported by Jet magazine, Thomas has said that he grew up speaking Gullah, a creole dialect spoken by African Americans on the coastal islands of the southeastern United States. Unlike other Supreme Court justices, he rarely asks questions from the bench during court proceedings. He has said that he developed this habit of silent listening when he was young because he found it a struggle to speak  standard English  correctly in school. Nevertheless, he was always a strong student.Clarence Thomas went on to become a US Supreme Court Justice and champion of our Constitution.Apparently, the Smithsonian can t find space in their museum for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a highly accomplished conservative black man, who was born into poverty, and through sheer determination and hard work, became the longest serving black Supreme Court Justice in America s history.

OKLAHOMA LAWMAKER BLASTED FOR SAYING: “Shouldn’t Mosques Be Removed After 911 by ANTIFA Logic?” [VIDEO],"Oklahoma State Rep. John Bennett made a comment on Facebook that was has since been removed after local Muslims didn t see any moral equivalency between removing Mosques after 9/11 and removing Confederate statues. Everyone freaked out about his comment even the governor of Oklahoma. We d like to know what you think See below for more info on this Patriot!OKLAHOMA CITY   A Facebook post by an Oklahoma lawmaker is receiving a lot of attention after the post suggested removing mosques from America.The post by Rep. John Bennett suggests that if Confederate monuments are being removed because of the Civil War, mosques should also be removed due to 9/11. If we re removing Confederate monuments after the Civil War, I think we should also be removing mosques after 9/11,  his Facebook post said. It is not an idol. It s a place where serve the poor, take care of the hungry and cure the sick. Making this association is extremely irrational,  said Imad Enchassi with the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City.  This is a place where American Muslims, Oklahoma Muslims, proudly serve fellow Oklahomans. The post has since been taken down.NO FREE SPEECH ALLOWED We re all supposed to just fall in line with what we re told TRUTH IS THE NEW HATE SPEECH Bennett is one smart cookie! He called for a suspension of Syrian refugees way back in November of 2015:SALLISAW, OK   State Rep. John Bennett, Sallisaw-02 (R) has called on Governor Fallin to suspend Oklahoma s effort in resettling Syrian refugees in Oklahoma. According to the New York Times article on October 21, 2015, there have been dozens of Syrian refugees settled in Jenks, OK since 2012,  said Bennett.  What s disturbing is that when I contacted the Jenks Police Department about this issue, they advised that the New York Times  article was the first time anyone in their office knew about these resettlements. Bennett continued,  Given the light of the Paris attacks and that some of the terrorists arrived in France as Syrian refugees, I am calling on Governor Fallin to immediately suspend any current plans to relocate Syrian refugees in Jenks or elsewhere in Oklahoma and to identify those that have arrived under the relocation program since 2012.

NAACP PRESIDENT Shocks Locals with Stance on Confederate Statues and Protests Against Them," I think it s all senseless. All senseless.    Bethlehem, PA NAACP President Esther Lee  Bethlehem, PA NAACP President Esther Lee brought some common sense to the craziness going on all around America right now. Leave it to the wise elderly lady to set everyone straight We love what she had to say!Esther Lee doesn t agree with the vandalism of Confederate monuments in Baltimore or condone the actions of those who tore down the statue in North Carolina, either. You know that s history. That was in that point in time. You can t eliminate what history is. So I disapprove with young people pulling down those statues,  she says.Lee then adds,  A young woman died. Two officers were murdered in a plane crash and all for what? Because somebody in their mind decided,  we don t need to look at that anymore. It shouldn t be,  she says softly.President Trump weighed in on the question about taking Confederate statues down by saying,  This week, it s Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder is it George Washington next week? Is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you do really have to ask yourself where does it stop? While Lee doesn t agree with President Trump on everything, she does think that history should be left to stand and advises others to join her in praying for the president. I would pray that he would gain the strength to do what s necessary in the job, at least for these four years,  she says.Lee says maybe things aren t what they should be. But that doesn t mean hate and hurt need to win.She says, instead, what we should do, is widen our circle of compassion.A spokeswoman for Gettysburg National Military Park says they haven t received any complaints about their hundreds of monuments and markers and she says they have no plans to remove anything memorializing Confederates leaders or soldiers.Read more: WFMZ",politics,"Aug 20, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

"BREAKING: DNC STAFFERS May Have Sold Sensitive Info To “Hostile Foreign Governments”…”A Massive, Massive Scandal”","Well, well, well The DNC IT scandal could become the biggest yet with the new investigation by federal authorities into whether sensitive date was sold to foreign agents. Former DNC Chair and DNC IT staffers are all involved.  Shady  doesn t even begin to describe these staffers who would sell out their own mother.CLAIMS OF PROFILING DON T STAND A CHANCE The defense for this criminal behavior from both the lawyer (former Clinton associate) and former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz is that these staffers are being targeted for being Muslim. DWS said recently that scrutiny of her Muslim aide was motivated by  racial and ethnic profiling.  The lawyer for the ringleader in all of this said his client was only indicted  for working while Muslim. The main stream media is ignoring this HUGE scandal because they care more about statues Here s the low down:IT STAFFERS HAD ACCESS TO MOST CONGRESSIONAL INFO IMRAN AWAN and the other four staffers under investigation had  full and complete access  to lawmakers  e-mails, calendars, schedules, hearing notes, meeting notes and memos and other sensitive information.Federal authorities are investigating whether sensitive data was stolen from congressional offices by several Pakistani-American tech staffers and sold to Pakistani or Russian intelligence, knowledgeable sources say.WASSERMAN SHULTZ THREATENS CAPITOL POLICE TO HAND OVER COMPUTER What started out 16 months ago as a scandal involving the alleged theft of computer equipment from Congress has turned into a national-security investigation involving FBI surveillance of the suspects.Investigators now suspect that sensitive US government data   possibly including classified information   could have been compromised and may have been sold to hostile foreign governments that could use it to blackmail members of Congress or even put their lives at risk. This is a massive, massive scandal    SENIOR US OFFICIALAlarm bells went off in April 2016 when computer security officials in the House reported  irregularities  in computer equipment purchasing.

LISTEN TO JEH JOHNSON’S BIZARRE REASON We Must Remove Confederate Statues…”Homeland Security” Threat? [Video],"This is rich! The guy who opened our borders to criminals during the Obama era is now telling us that statues are a homeland security threat?  Former Obama administration official Jeh Johnson said on This Week with Martha Raditz that the removal of Confederate statues was a matter of  public safety and homeland security  on Sunday Oh brother!A single protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee turned violent last week. Charlottesville, WV was the sight of the engineered confrontation of two groups that got out of hand because the police officers were told to stand down.Jeh Johnson served as Secretary of Homeland Security under Obama but failed miserably to keep our homeland secure. We now have a mess that President Trump is trying to clean up. Johnson allowed violent gangs like MS13 to enter towns across America. He allowed thousands of illegal alien minor children to just roam free. Johnson is responsible for much of the illegal alien crime we re seeing now. The lawless policy of Obama and Johnson hurt many Americans.So now Johnson is saying that it s a problem that rallying Americans who want to keep Confederate statues are the violent ones??? THE VIOLENCE IS COMING FROM ANTIFA AND BLACK LIVES MATTER ON THE LEFT!THIS IS NOT TRUE:  What alarms so many of us from a security perspective is that so many of the statues, the Confederate monuments, are now, modern-day, becoming symbols and rallying points for white nationalism, for neo-Nazis, for the KKK, and this is most alarming,  Johnson said.  We fought a world war against Naziism. The KKK reigned terror on African Americans for generations. I salute those in cities and states who are taking down a lot of these monuments for reasons of public safety and security,  he added.  And that s not a a matter of political correctness. That s a matter of public safety and homeland security and doing what s right. Host Martha Raddatz said she felt the Trump administration would call that a  slippery slope,  referring to local Washington locations like Washington-Lee High School and Jefferson Davis Highway. Where should that stop?  Raddatz asked.Johnson said those kinds of decisions should be made at the local level.President Donald Trump slammed the removal of such monuments as  foolish  and for ripping apart the  history and culture of our great country.

"HUD OFFICIAL Spends $366,000 in Fed Funds on Booze, Makeup, Clothes and Homes…You Won’t Believe Her Punishment!","WHY IS THIS CRIMINAL ALLOWED TO JUST SKATE BY WITH SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF JAIL TIME?We know that this woman is working on a plea bargain but FIVE YEARS??? The two things that are so outrageous about this entire case are that there was NO OVERSIGHT and that this WENT ON FOR 8 YEARS!!!USING THE FEDS AS YOUR OWN PERSONAL PIGGY BANK:Lorena Loren s job was to help poor people find housing Instead, prosecutors say, she was stealing from the poor to buy booze, makeup, clothes and homes for her relatives.But after years of scheming, authorities say, the government caught on. IT TOOK 8 YEARS!In a public corruption case that surfaced in federal court today, Loren, the former executive director of the St. Clair Housing Commission, was charged with embezzling more than $300,000 in low-income housing funds and spending the money on herself and family.According to a charging document filed in U.S. District Court, Loren s scheme ran between 2008-2016 and benefited many family members, including her husband, son and son-in-law.Prosecutors say Loren s criminal activity started in 2008   five years after she was appointed executive director of the St. Clair Housing Commission, which administers federally funded low-income housing programs in St. Clair County.According to court records, Loren used her job in many nefarious ways, including:  She fraudulently used the housing commission s two credit cards to buy personal items for herself and relatives, including nearly $135,000 in online purchases from Amazon.com; $14,364 in purchases from Sam s Club in Port Huron, and $16,460 in purchases from various Walmart stores. The purchases included, among other things, adult and infant clothing, furniture, food, beauty supplies, medications and alcoholic beverages.  Her unauthorized Amazon.com purchases included $60,000 worth of bedroom furniture, mattresses, appliances and other household items for family members. The items were shipped to Loren s relatives in Georgia and Florida.  She embezzled $24,600 in commission funds to pay for her son s rental unit.  She lied on four government housing contracts by claiming that her son-in-law was the landlord of a rental property for low-income residents in Michigan, when it was really her home in Port Austin.  She falsified lease agreements and stole public housing money that was supposed to help poor people to rent a home for her son.  She  directed members of her family to establish bank accounts  so that federal rental subsidy payments could be deposited into those accounts. The relatives then used the money for their own personal use, including rent for their Florida residences.Loren is charged in what is known as an information, which typically means she is working on a deal with the government. She is charged with conspiracy to commit federal program fraud. If convicted, she faces up to five years in prison.Loren home Lorena Loren bought this $325,000 home in Georgia after federal prosecutors say she embezzled more than $336,000 from the St. Clair Housing Commission.JUDICIAL WATCH: HUD s inspector general has testified before Congress about the severe mismanagement at offshoots functioning independently yet federally funded in states across the country that have fleeced taxpayers out of hundreds of millions of dollars. He testified that his office discovered more than $200 million in questionable spending at local public housing agencies (PHAs) since 2012. PHAs are created by states, operate at the city or county level and administer the federal program known as Section 8 to provide low-income people with affordable housing.

REMEMBER WHEN DONALD TRUMP FOUGHT Palm Beach Officials To Make Mar-a-Lago A Club That Welcomed Blacks and Jews When Other Clubs Excluded Them?,"The Washington Post reported: The patriarchs of this quiet island of millionaires threw up roadblocks when Donald Trump swooped in and turned its historic oceanfront Mar-a-Lago mansion into a private club.The town council, seeing Trump as an ostentatious outsider, handed him a list of restrictions as he sought to transform the property in the 1990s. Membership, traffic, party attendance, even photography   all would be strictly limited.But Trump undercut his adversaries with a searing attack, claiming that local officials seemed to accept the established private clubs in town that had excluded Jews and blacks while imposing tough rules on his inclusive one.Trump s lawyer sent every member of the town council copies of two classic movies about discrimination:  A Gentleman s Agreement,  about a journalist who pretends to be Jewish to expose anti-Semitism, and  Guess Who s Coming to Dinner  about a white couple s reaction to their daughter bringing home a black fiance.The move infuriated council members, who said it was a distraction from their concerns that Trump s club would spoil a quiet street. But, in time, Trump got most of the restrictions lifted.In many ways Mar-a-Lago is the antithesis of the area s traditional WASP-y clubs the Beach Club, the Bath and Tennis Club, the Sailfish Club. The Everglades Club, Palm Beach s oldest and founded in 1919, is what Nicholas Golubov, research director for the Historical Society of Palm Beach, called a bastion of  the old, Palm Beach elite. Trump s business model in Palm Beach, by comparison, has been a beacon of inclusion. As long as potential members had the $100,000 entry fee (bumped up to $200,000 in January), there was a good chance that they d be accepted. In a further departure from Palm Beach taste, Trump allowed non-members, as well as members, to rent spaces for bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, weddings, and charity galas. Anyone can party at the new Winter White House, as long as they can afford it. I think it s the best thing Trump did in his whole life,  said Laurence Leamer, the author of the book Madness Under the Royal Palms: Love and Death Behind the Gates of Palm Beach.  He opened up this island. He also had Jews and gays and African Americans he even had the first gay wedding. Most Palm Beach clubs have unapologetically restrictive membership policies, but resist any notion that those policies have anything to do with race, creed, or color.  That s an old-fashioned view, certainly of our club,  said John Newman, general manager Sailfish Club.  We have no discrimination in our club; members have to be sponsored by a current member, but we have all faiths in our club.  (The Bath and Tennis, Beach, and Everglades clubs declined to comment for this article; Mar-a-Lago did not respond to requests for comment.) Bloomberg Palm Beach has a lot of rules: No whistling allowed on public streets after midnight. No  Missing Dog    or any sign   posted on a tree. And no flag poles taller than 42 feet.In late 2006 Trump put up a giant American flag on an 80-foot pole. That led to a $1,250-a-day fine against him, drawing national headlines that Trump basked in. Tonight, Donald Trump does legal battle again, this time with a bunch of millionaires down in Palm Beach, Florida, who told Trump he s flying his flag too high,  is how Nancy Grace started her CNN interview in January 2007 with Trump.  Can you fly the American flag too high?  she asked.Trump got fan mail as he said in a blizzard of interviews:  No American should have to get a permit to fly the flag. I said,  This is a dream to have someone sue me to take down the American flag,  Trump said in the interview.Trump sued Palm Beach for $25 million in damages, arguing the flag was constitutionally protected free speech.Ultimately, Trump reached a settlement with the town. He would put a slightly smaller flag farther from the road and mount it on a 70-foot pole.Instead of paying any fines, Trump made a $100,000 donation to a veterans charity.",politics,"Aug 20, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
ANTIFA MANUAL FOUND On Evergreen College Campus: Shut Down Their Rallies…Force The Media To Show Our Side As The Righteous One,"This copy of the Antifa Manual, that is used by the George Soros funded, violent, anti-American, anti free-speech radical group, was allegedly found on the Evergreen College campus. The content of this manual is disturbing and should be read by every American, so we understand what we are up against. It helps to explain why these groups call our President and his supporters  Hitler  or  racists  or  homophobes.  It s not that Trump or his supporters are any of these things, it s just part of a campaign to humiliate and shut down any opposition to radicals whose ultimate goal is a one world order and the destruction of capitalism in America. This manual gives every day Americans a look into the mind of a leftist radical who hates America and everything Americans stand for. They clearly have no regard for free-speech and are willing to use any means necessary, including deceit, outright lies and of course, violence to achieve their ultimate goals of a New World Order.This page explains how Antifa members are to use name-calling as a means to create a culture of tolerance.  When all else fails, compare someone to Hitler.  Next they discuss how to use ones minority status, and to remember that you are  Black first  and  American second.  or  Gay/Lesbian first  and  American third  and so on.It s important to gain control of the media through any means necessary.Some major media conglomerates are swinging to our side, but they have not gone far enough.It s no coincidence that CNN just published a fluff piece on Antifa today: Unmasking the leftist Antifa movementThe CNN piece was clearly written to shed a sympathetic light on the violent group that s been caught attacking and harming so many innocent Americans, many of them were harmed by Antifa for defending free speech and/or our President Donald J. Trump.Look for the leftist media to kick it into high gear when it comes to defending the violence perpetrated on innocent Americans by the violent Antifa group. More of these soft pieces on the radical Antifa group are sure to be popping up over the next several months.If you are seeking positions of power in the media, be sure to obfuscate and hide your true intentions on the various social media platforms.Use social media as a baton to slap down anyone who hold fascist viewpoints. Call them racist, homophobic, misogynistic. Create an echo chamber around you.The next step is to threaten the livelihood of anyone who dares speak out against our agenda.The pro-abortion page: This page talks about how white people are able to afford to have their  fetuses  aborted, while  people of color  have little choice but to keep a baby to term.And finally, the ultimate goal is a New World Order and a New World Government where hatred and bigotry no longer exist. Imagine, if Antifa could figure out a way through George Soros funded activity, to shut down the rights of every American using violence and hatred at tools, their dream might just be possible until they wake up and realize of course, that most Americans don t hate this country and aren t interested in Antifa s special brand of violence and chaos.",politics,"Aug 19, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Alt-Left Vandalizes Catholic Saint Statue: “The statue should come down”,"President Trump was right again! He said mob rule of removing statues is a slippery slope. Where does it end? A great example of the problem is the latest statue to be vandalized:On top of people calling for the removal of George Washington s statue and the Jefferson Memorial, vandals in California have pointed their crosshairs at recently-canonized St. Junipero Serra.According to a CBS Local report, a photo circulating the rounds on Facebook shows that a statue of Junipero Serra alongside a Native American boy in a park across from Mission San Fernando was vandalized with red paint and the word  murder  written in white. The Native American boy had a swastika painted across his chest.City officials could not confirm the photo s authenticity. However, when investigators went to the site, they did indeed see red paint on Serra s arm and a swastika painted on the child next to him, which means the neighboring Catholic mission apparently cleaned the statue as best they could to avoid drawing controversy.That would make perfect sense, considering that whenever the Left gets their hands on controversy like this, they always show up to get their inner Bolshevik on.Some of the people interviewed by CBS expressed disapproval of the statue s presence, falsely claiming that St. Junipero Serra sought the destruction of Native American culture.Read more: Daily Wire",politics,"Aug 19, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

According to Axios: Steve Bannon is about to becoe a very big threat to the Murdoch Brothers conservative-leaning network news monopoly.Unshaven and working from home in cargo shorts as he moves into  Bannon the Barbarian  mode, Steve Bannon is thinking bigger than Breitbart.Axios  Jonathan Swan hears Bannon has told friends he sees a massive opening to the right of Fox News, raising the possibility that he s going to start a network.Bannon s friends are speculating about whether it will be a standalone TV network, or online streaming only. Before his death in May, Roger Ailes had sent word to Bannon that he wanted to start a channel together. Bannon loved the idea: He believes Fox is heading in a squishy, globalist direction as the Murdoch sons assume more power. Now he has the means, motive and opportunity: His chief financial backer, Long Island hedge fund billionaire Bob Mercer, is ready to invest big in what s coming next, including a huge overseas expansion of Breitbart News. On Day 1, Bannon declared he s taking his West Wing infighting to the outside, telling Bloomberg Businessweek s Josh Green that he s  going to war for Trump against his opponents   on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America. The reality is that Bannon will go nuclear on former colleagues he calls  West Wing Democrats : economic adviser Gary Cohn, Jared and Ivanka ( Javanka,  as he calls them) and Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell.The revved-up Breitbart operation is also likely to target Speaker Ryan, as it did before Trump.Why it matters: The country s national political conversation is about to get even uglier, if you can imagine. It s going to be dark, and toxic, with a fight on the right that may be more bitter and personal than hostilities between Republicans and Democrats.Will Steve Bannon be more useful to the conservative movement on the outside? Will he use his experiences in the White House and his vast knowledge in the world of conservative media to build a media empire that could crush the Murdoch s FOX News network? Many Americans will be wondering Will Bannon hire Bill O Reilly, the one man who kept Fox News at the top of the ratings for over a decade? President Trump wished Steve Bannon well in his return to Breitbart News. Is it possible Trump knew of Bannon s plans to build a right-leaning media empire that could take down the leftist fake news monopoly we currently see in America?100 Percent FED UP  With the liberal sons of Rupert Murdoch now firmly at the helm of what once was a conservative-leaning alternative to leftist cable news shows like CNN, MSNBC and the mainstream media news outlets, there is a very good chance Americans are witnessing the end of a significant era where FOX News ruled the ratings and liberal-run propaganda networks only dreamed of the kind of revenue they were pulling down.It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of Fox News  sacking of Bill O Reilly.Not only was he the single most dominant public figure in America s vast conservative media environment, his removal signals the growing power of James and Lachlan Murdoch in the world s most powerful media empire, their father Rupert Murdoch s 21st Century Fox.O Reilly was dismissed overnight following allegations of sexual harassment by at least six women. It has been reported that Lachlan s wife Sarah Murdoch helped influence the decision. Last year the former Fox News creator, Roger Ailes, was sacked in similar circumstances, going on to advise Donald Trump s presidential campaign.Murdoch s support for Trump distinguishes him from some of his children, including James, who told more than one friend of his dismay that his father was backing the Trump candidacy. James s wife, Kathryn, backed Hillary Clinton during the campaign and has been a vocal critic of the new president on Twitter. In September Kathryn tweeted:  A vote for Trump is a vote for climate catastrophe , while on the night of the president s stunning election victory she wrote:  I can t believe this is happening. I am so ashamed. James and Kathryn are committed environmentalists: she is on the board of the Environmental Defense Fund, which a Fox News report recently labelled a  leftwing group , while James wrote in The Washington Post in 2009 that  conservation-minded conservatives  were  missing in the heated partisanship of today s politics .   Financial TimesJames Murdoch s wife works for the Clinton Climate Initiative. She is an outspoken hater of President Trump on Twitter and much of her hate is directed at his refusal to accept that man-made climate warming cooling change is settled science. Here are a few examples of the hate she spews for Donald Trump on Twitter:""An angry reflex in search of an idea"" sums up a lot https://t.co/sof1ZB4paw  Kathryn Murdoch (@KathrynAMurdoch) March 28, 2017Will Sean Hannity leave the left-leaning Fox News for a less hostile environment? Will Bannon put Greta VanSusteran back on the air? How long will conservatives like Jesse Watters and Judge Jeanine stick around the sinking ship with radical leftist personalities like Shep Smith, Juan Williams and Geraldo Rivera covering the side of news that the Murdoch brothers and their Trump-hating wives approve of?

WATCH: COWARDLY ANTIFA THUGS Surround Afghanistan Veteran At Boston Free Speech Rally…Scream In His Face: “F*ck Off Nazi Scum!”,"***WARNING***This video is very disturbing!Try to imagine this brave man who voluntarily enlisted in our US military, traveled halfway around the world to Afghanistan where he risked his life to defend our nation against some of the most evil people on the planet, only to come home to some of the most evil people in America shouting,  F*ck off Nazi scum!  in his face. The saddest part of this video is watching the Afghanistan veteran actually attempt to have dialogue with these anti-American jack-asses, who are likely only there to collect a paycheck from George Soros.The crime of attending the free-speech rally in and of itself, was enough to anger these anti-Americans, but the moment this veteran admitted to supporting President Trump, the angry Alt-Left crowd began to come unhinged. Would this video of an Afghanistan veteran, who appears to be all by himself in a large group of violent, Soros funded Antifa thugs,  be splashed all over every network in America if he was verbally assaulted by this group of masked cowards for defending Barack Obama during his presidency? If we didn t know better, we d almost think there was a double standard in America.Antifa assembled at the entry point of the free speech rally. pic.twitter.com/FaXVdnbfD0  Kirk and Callahan (@KirkAndCallahan) August 19, 2017There is no place for these types of violent, masked cowards in America.

"WATCH: THESE ARE THE LEFTISTS Mitt Romney, John McCain, Marco Rubio and Our Liberal Media Attacked President Trump For Not Defending","Earlier this week, prominent members of the GOP like Mitt Romney, John McCain and Marco Rubio attacked President Trump for condemning both sides for the violence in Charlottesville, VA last weekend. Today, two police officers were killed in an apparent ambush today in Kissimmee, Florida. Both men woke up, put their uniforms on and committed to protecting total strangers. Instead of protecting them, these two brave men, Officer Matthew Baxter and Sergeant Sam Howard were ambushed and murdered by the cowards police believe dialed 911 for help.On the other side of the nation, at almost the same time that two innocent police officers were being murdered, brave Boston police officers and Massachusetts State Police were defending 50 pro-free speech Americans, who were surrounded by 30,000 hateful and violent protesters who were threatening American citizens for daring to take a stand for the First Amendment. The pro free-speech Americans had to be carted away in by police in wagons, as violent leftists waited for them to exit the Boston Commons area where they gathered with American flags and peacefully spoke to one another about the importance of free speech in America.Here s a picture of some of the  White Supremacists  defending free-speech in Boston today:https://twitter.com/TruthinGov2016/status/898987969373011969Watch CNN totally lie to their viewers, as they twist the narrative of the FREE SPEECH rally, calling it an  Alt-Right  rally:#BlackLivesMatter organized march started in Boston against racism & Alt-light rally at #BostonCommon & in solidarity w #Charlottesville. pic.twitter.com/hEljI0lyxG  Sara Sidner (@sarasidnerCNN) August 19, 2017Brave Boston police officers were deployed to keep the peace.  Keeping 30,000 angry leftists away from 50 peaceful Americans is  no easy task when you have people on the left who are itching for a fight. Their fight is not just with Americans who want to protect our First Amendment Right to free speech, it s also with the cops. Former GOP presidential candidates like Mitt Romney, John McCain and Marco Rubio took to social media to trash President Trump for not embracing the violent left (the same groups of leftist agitators who were in Charlottesville that are now in Boston). What these sore losers have clearly forgotten is how Barack Obama and his administrations embraced the war on our law enforcement. What these clowns don t see is that cops being murdered or innocent Americans being beaten bloody because they don t hold the same leftist views is never going to end, unless we have a leader who is willing to call them out.Watch this large group surround and threaten one young man who was all by himself because he was wearing a Trump hat.

“HOW CAN WE GET BEHIND SUCH CORRUPTION?” CNN PANEL Shocked by Truth from Black Patriot After They Tried to Tell Him He’s Wrong About the Racist DNC [Video],"The video below is a classic  from the campaign. It s rare that CNN doesn t cut people off like this man. Gary Frazier gives a dose of truth serum to the panel on CNN but they won t listen This is awesome!Katrina Pierson commented and then Frazier was asked to respond. Well, the last thing that CNN s Carol costello expected was agreement from Frazier. The other panelists try and tell Frazier he s wrong. LOL!  You tried to send us Oprah then you sent us Obama The truth is that the DNC has used race as a tool to divide for decades. They don t want the black community to rise up and see the truth. It s been great for the Democrats to have the black community s support and they don t want to lose those votes. That s why you constantly hear people in power trying to create racial strife It s been profitable for them in so many ways. Until we start to have a real conversation about what we re going to do with those in the minority communities, how can we ever get behind such corruption?

LIBERALS HAVE NO BUSINESS Criticizing President Trump Until They Can Explain What Former President Obama Is Doing In This Photo,"The Democrats and their allies in the media have spent most of this entire week condemning President Trump for blaming both sides for the violent confrontations in Charlottesville, Va. The problem is, President Trump never once condoned the actions of the KKK or the Nazi sympathizers. Trump simply said that both sides (including the violent Antifa and Black Lives Matter protesters) were at fault.Where was the condemnation from the media and the Democrat Party when President Barack Obama eulogized the former KKK Grand Dragon Robert Byrd?  In the early 1940s, a politically ambitious butcher from West Virginia named Bob Byrd recruited 150 of his friends and associates to form a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. After Byrd had collected the $10 joining fee and $3 charge for a robe and hood from every applicant, the  Grand Dragon  for the mid-Atlantic states came down to tiny Crab Orchard, W.Va., to officially organize the chapter.As Byrd recalls now, the Klan official, Joel L. Baskin of Arlington, Va., was so impressed with the young Byrd s organizational skills that he urged him to go into politics.  The country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation,  Baskin said.The young Klan leader went on to become one of the most powerful and enduring figures in modern Senate history. Throughout a half-century on Capitol Hill, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) has twice held the premier leadership post in the Senate, helped win ratification of the Panama Canal treaty, squeezed billions from federal coffers to aid his home state, and won praise from liberals for his opposition to the war in Iraq and his defense of minority party rights in the Senate.   Washington PostWhen the KKK Grand Dragon died in July of 2010, President Barack Obama eulogized him, while Hillary Clinton sang the praises of the West Virginia Democrat Senator Robert Byrd she called her  mentor. During his eulogy, President Barack Obama expressed his admiration for the KKK Grand Dragon and later, the US Senator Robert Byrd: And as I reflect on the full sweep of his 92 years, it seems to me that his life bent towards justice,  Obama said.  Like the Constitution he tucked in his pocket, like our nation itself, Robert Byrd possessed that quintessential American quality, and that is a capacity to change, a capacity to learn, a capacity to listen, a capacity to be made more perfect.

Crosby has dismissed the Motor City Madman s work as not good enough, while Nugent called the former Byrds star a  bloated chemical repository  in response.Nugent fired the first shot last week when he accused Hall of Fame boss Jann Wenner of hating the Second Amendment and the NRA, of which Nugent is a board member.

However, asked if he d like to be inducted, he replied,  Hell, yes. Crosby got involved on Monday, when he was asked via Twitter whether he agreed with Nugent s assessment, and replied:  No, the a hole just isn t good enough.

TRUMP’S DOJ MAKES Announcement on Anti-Gun Obama-Era “Operation Choke Point”,"The program is dead! Operation Choke Point is no longer a huge nuisance to gun dealers. Republican leaders like Bob Goodlatte made it clear to the Trump administration s DOJ that they wanted this program to end ASAP.Eric Holder launched the program when he was attorney general. The program was a thorn in the side of gun dealers because it hurt a gun dealer s ability to receive financial services from banks.One statement from the DOJ stands out:  Law abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an industry that a particular administration might disfavor. HUH? SHOULDN T IT GO WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE DOJ SHOULDN T TARGET CERTAIN BUSINESSES??? WHAT IN THE WORLD!GOP lawmakers wrote:  Operation Choke Point was an Obama Administration initiative that destroyed legitimate businesses to which that Administration was ideologically opposed (e.g., firearms dealers) by intimidating financial institutions into denying banking services to those businesses. TRUNP DOJ ENDS HOLDER PROGRAM HINDERING GUN DEALERSThe Trump Justice Department is ending an Obama-era program that had attempted to cut off credit to shady businesses but came under fire from Republicans for unfairly targeting gun dealers and other legitimate operations.Just days after top House Republicans had pressed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to shutter Operation Choke Point, the department confirmed in a response letter that the program is dead. All of the Department s bank investigations conducted as part of Operation Chokepoint are now over, the initiative is no longer in effect, and it will not be undertaken again,  Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said in the Aug. 16-dated letter, calling it a  misguided initiative  from the prior administration.Read more: Fox News",politics,"Aug 18, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

"BREAKING NEWS: Trump’s Chief Strategist, STEVE BANNON IS GONE!…ANN COULTER: Not Good News, Trump Should’ve Hired “Ten More Like Him”…NEWT GINGRICH Sounds Alarm","This is a very big deal. It s very likely that Steve Bannon, who was one of Andrew Breitbart s best friends, knew, and understood the left better than any person on Trump s White House staff. This could be a big blow to Trump and the unprecedented battle he s been fighting against a ruthless and moral-less opponent.White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is leaving his position in President Donald Trump s administration. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve s last day,  press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement Friday.  We are grateful for his service and wish him the best. The Drudge Report first reported the news, and said that he may return to the conservative website Breitbart.The political strategist reportedly submitted his resignation to the president on Aug. 7, according to The New York Times. While it was scheduled for Monday, Bannon s resignation was delayed in the aftermath of the violent protests in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. Trump and administration officials have been deliberating for some time as to when and how to release Bannon.Bannon was one of the first people to jump on board the president s political team when he announced his bid for the presidency in 2015. Rumors floated Thursday that Bannon might lose his job after the political strategist landed in hot water after The Prospect released an article Wednesday in which Bannon made some unsavory comments regarding members of the administration.  Daily CallerAnn Coulter told the Daily Caller that the Bannon firing is  Not good news  and that  Trump should ve hired ten more like him Conservative commentator Ann Coulter is upset about Steve Bannon s ouster and believes it  makes it appear that Trump is easily manipulable by the media. Bannon, a staunch conservative and supporter of Trump s agenda, left his post as White House chief strategist Friday after months of media criticism. The former Breitbart executive kept a whiteboard in his wall that kept track of Trump s campaign promises and was in a constant battle against moderates in the White House like Gary Cohn and Jared Kushner. This makes it appear that Trump is easily manipulable by the media,  Coulter told The Daily Caller Friday over email.  They just need to give all credit to any White House staffer they want to get rid of. I dread to think of who the media decide to get rid of next. President Trump has recently been upset about a book that heavily credits Bannon with Trump s White House victory. He told a close confidant,  I hate it when people take credit for an election I won. Coulter wrote to the TheDC,  Trump is right that Bannon isn t responsible for Trump s win. Of course, Trump won the nomination and the presidency of his own will! Bannon supported those issues and supported Trump at least as early as January 2016,  Coulter added.  Who else in the White House did? Most of the White House staff wasn t on the Trump train until after the election. She went on to write:  Not good news. Instead of firing Bannon, because Trump had his nose out of joint about the media giving Bannon all credit for the victory, Trump should ve hired ten more like him. Media heads would have exploded. Former Speaker of the House and longtime Trump supporter Newt Gingrich is seriously worried about the future of Donald Trump s presidency.Gingrich, who has consistently been one of Trump s most optimistic supporters, said Friday morning that Trump is more isolated than he realizes and needs to make  serious changes  if he s going to have a stable presidency. I think he s in a position right now where he s much more isolated than he realizes,  Gingrich said in an interview with Fox News  Bill Hemmer.  On the Hill, he has far more people willing to sit to one side and not help him right now, and I think that he needs to recognize that he s taken a good first step with bringing in General Kelly, but he needs to think about what has not worked. You don t get down to 35 percent approval and have people in your own party shooting at you and conclude that everything s going fine.

CHRISTIAN GROUPS FEARFUL AFTER TARGETED in Fake Hate Groups List Released by CNN,"CNN published a hate group map and list from the Southern Poverty Law Center that targeted many Christian Organizations. The organizations are fearful for their safety after the bogus  hate map  with the headline,  Here are all the active hate groups where you live.  The Southern Poverty Law Center will have blood on their hands if they cause the injury of anyone in these Christian groups. It s bad enough that they labeled these groups as hate groups but now the people in the groups are fearful.Todd Starnes of Townhall reported:The list included among others American Family Association, Family Research Council, Alliance Defending Freedom, Liberty Counsel and Pacific Justice Institute.American Family Association blasted the CNN story calling it a  sham news article that could easily incite violence and place AFA employees and supporters in harm s way. Liberty Counsel President Mat Staver demanded an immediate retraction   calling CNN s report  false, defamatory and dangerous. Liberty Counsel is not a hate group,  he said.  The false  hate  label is very damaging to our reputation and is a safety risk to our staff. Liberty Counsel is a Christian ministry, and hates no one. Conservatives and Christians have good reason to be worried.In 2012, Floyd Lee Corkins opened fire inside Family Research Council headquarters in Washington, D.C. A security guard was shot and wounded.The domestic terrorist told police he wanted to kill as many employees as possible to intimidate opponents of same-sex marriage. Corkins brought along Chick-fil-A sandwiches, which he intended to smear on the faces of dead staffers.Corkins told authorities that he picked his target using the Southern Poverty Law Center s so-called  hate map. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins appeared on my nationally syndicated radio show Thursday to condemn CNN for using material from an organization that is  an attack dog of the Left. They are not a neutral arbiter that is calling balls and strikes. They are on the field   playing. They are pushing an agenda and anyone who opposes them   they slap a label on them,  Perkins told me. They are inciting violence and it needs to stop,  he added.READ MORE: TOWNHALL",politics,"Aug 18, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
BOTTOM FEEDERS PAINT “TEAR IT DOWN” on New Orleans’ Joan of Arc Statue,"HERE WE GO yet another statue of a military hero is reportedly under fire. This figure astride a horse was vandalized with the spray-painted words  Tear It Down .Who was this historical figure? General Lee? Stonewall Jackson? Nathan Bedford Forrest?No, this was a figure who hails from the north.Of France:The phrase  Tear it Down  was hastily sprayed in black paint across the base of the golden Joan of Arc statue on Decatur Street in the French Quarter sometime earlier this week. It has since been removed, with only the vaguest traces of the paint remaining. The  Tear it Down  tag would seem to relate to the debate surrounding the city s ongoing removal of four Confederate monuments. But the statue of Joan of Arc, a 15th-century military leader, martyr and Catholic saint, hasn t been mentioned in the controversy to this point.Amy Kirk Duvoisin, the founder of the annual Joan of Arc parade that ceremonially pauses at the statue on the first day of Carnival season, says she s confused by the vandalism. Surely, people realize she s not related to American history,  she said referring to the French icon.Nah, I wouldn t be so sure.KEEP JOAN OUT OF THIS!According to plaques accompanying the statue, the sculpture of Joan of Arc, who is also known as the Maid of Orleans, was  a gift of the people of France to the citizens of New Orleans  in 1972.On May 1 in Paris, the controversial former right-wing Nationalist Front Party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, known for his restrictive views on French immigration, led a rally at a duplicate golden statue of Joan of Arc in Paris.The Monumental Task Committee, an organization that describes itself as being devoted to  preserving, restoring and protecting monuments,  is soliciting for donations through its website to restore the Joan of Arc statue.Read more: NOLA ",politics,"Aug 18, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

VICE MAGAZINE CALLS FOR ISIS-LIKE DESTRUCTION: “Let’s Blow Up Mount Rushmore”,"It is becoming increasingly difficult to separate leftists from Islamic terrorists as both destroy monuments, statues, and seek to eliminate freedoms we enjoy. On a day in which an Islamic terrorist killed over a dozen people in Barcelona, senior editor Wilber Cooper has the audacity to publish an article for VICE Magazine urging the left to destroy Mt. Rushmore just like ISIS would.In his article  Let s Blow Up Mount Rushmore,  Cooper attacks the Founding Fathers and calls for a demolition of the monument. His call to erase historical markers, such as statues, echoes the recent movement from left-wingers for a culture war that would decimate Americans  political traditions and heroes. Those targeted heroes include Thomas Jefferson, former president and chief author of the Bill of Rights   such as the First Amendment   and General and President George Washington, who declined offers to become a dictator after winning the Revolutionary War.Cooper argues that these historical monuments and statues help preserve a system of racial exploitation and inequality, and should be erased to help build a new society. He says,  It s going to be impossible to improve America if we can t be honest about its origins and its past. He insists that  Trump and his white supremacist cohorts believe the reverence some Americans have for these statues is simply respect for history, and that tearing them down is tantamount to ripping pages out of a textbook. But monuments built by the state are not history they are manifestations of power. Upon acknowledging the insensitivity of the article s title given the tragic events which occurred earlier today in Spain, VICE Magazine deleted the original article and wrote an editor s note:  The headline and URL of this story have been updated. We do not condone violence in any shape or form, and the use of  blow up  in the original headline as a rhetorical device was misguided and insensitive. We apologize for the error. They have since changed the title to  Get Rid of Mount Rushmore.  Wow. What an improvement. Leftists continue to contradict their self-proclaimed peace-seeking objectives and prove that they are actually seeking to burn down the United States by getting rid of every trace of this great country s history. And you can bet they are coming for the Constitution next.Read more: Breitbart",politics,"Aug 17, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

ATLANTA JUDGE Punished for Telling the Truth About Radical Antifa Protesters “Tearing Down Monuments”,"And once again, the snowflakes want to erase parts of history they know nothing about. And what s more, they attack and penalize those who try to defend it.This week, an Atlanta judge was suspended upon posting his thoughts about Confederate monuments and so called  anti-fascist  protesters on Facebook. Judge James Hinkle wrote,  It looks like all of the snowflakes have no concept of history. It is what it is. Get over it and move on.  He went on to add,  The nut cases tearing down monuments are equivalent to ISIS destroying history. ISIS AND ANTIFA BELOW- BOTH HATE AMERICA AND DEAL WITH CONFLICT BY USING VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION.He noted that, Confederate monuments in Virginia have the rear ends of horses facing north. Following these posts, Hinkle was told by Gwinnett County s chief magistrate that he was suspended. Chief Judge Kristina Blum released the following statement:  I have made it clear to all of our judges to conduct themselves in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity, impartiality, and fairness of the judiciary. I consider any violation of those principles and policies to be a matter of utmost concern. Hinkle, who also served as the mayor of Grayson for over twenty years, previously made his views well known on social media when he posted he was  proud to be a deplorable infidel.  While many have been calling for his permanent removal, Hinkle has stated that he did not see what he did wrong.

MO DEMOCRAT LAWMAKER Under Investigation By Secret Service For Saying: “I Hope Trump Is Assassinated” On Facebook…But Response By Man Who Claims Cousin Is On Trump’s Secret Service Detail Could Be More Serious Threat,"The U.S. Secret Service is investigating a Facebook post from Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, in which she stated:  I hope Trump is assassinated! A conversation between MO state Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Christopher Gagn  of Ferguson, MO, (In his Facebook profile he claims he s an  Investigative Journalist focused on Social Justice, Police Misconduct and Prison Reform ) was screen shot and saved before either party had a chance to delete it. The conversation included the senator openly hoping that President Trump would be assassinated and Facebook user Christophe Gagne, who told her that his cousin is on President Trump s  Secret Service Detail . Gagn s comments seem to infer that his cousin is being forced to protect President Trump because he had to sign up for 6 years of service and has already served 4 years of his contract protecting Barack Obama. Gagn  went on to say,   I truly believe [it] will happen sooner not later.  while referring to the assassination of our president.For obvious reasons, everyone seems to be focused on what the MO state Senator said when she openly hoped for Trump s assassination, but shouldn t the Secret Service be making a call to Christopher Gagn  who claims to have a cousin assigned to protecting the life of our president and claiming that he will be assassinated sooner than later? Does Gagn have some sort of an inside scoop? For all we know, Gagn  may not even be telling the truth about having a cousin on President Trump s Secret Service detail, but sure seems it would certainly be worth the time it would take for the Secret Service to look into it.  St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Chappelle-Nadal s comment, referring to President Donald Trump, has since been removed. But Chappelle-Nadal confirmed to the Post-Dispatch that she had written it in response to another commenter before deleting it. I didn t mean what I put up. Absolutely not. I was very frustrated,  Chappelle-Nadal told the newspaper.  Things have got to change. The U.S. Secret Service s St. Louis field office  is looking into this,  the office confirmed.Kristina Schmidt, special agent in charge, told the Post-Dispatch that  hypothetically  in such investigations, agents try to  determine intent, to determine if there was a violation of federal law. If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. Attorney. Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it,  Schmidt said.According to a screenshot of the now-deleted conversation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, another commenter named Christopher Gagn  was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trump s Secret Service detail. But, what I posted earlier, I truly believe will happen, sooner   not later,  he wrote.

THROWING GAS ON RACIAL FIRE? VA Police Confirm….Governor Terry McAuliffe LIED About Weapons Being Hid Around Charlottesville By White Nationalists,"Will the mainstream media report about this?Contradicting statements by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia State Police say they did not find caches of weapons stashed around Charlottesville in advance of last Saturday s deadly white nationalist rally.In an interview Monday on the Pod Save the People podcast, hosted by Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, McAuliffe claimed the white nationalists who streamed into Charlottesville that weekend hid weapons throughout the town. They had battering rams and we had picked up different weapons that they had stashed around the city,  McAuliffe told Mckesson.McAuliffe s comments were picked up by other news outlets and spread through social media. But Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, says that no such stashes were found. The governor was referring to the briefing provided him in advance of Saturday s rally and the extra security measures being taken by local and state police,  Geller tells Reason.  As a safety precaution in advance of August 12, such searches were conducted in and around Emancipation and McIntire Parks. No weapons were located as a result of those searches. The Virginia State Police also disputed McAuliffe s claims that Virginia State Police were underequipped to deal with the heavily armed militia members at Saturday s rally. The governor was referencing the weapons and tactical gear the members of various groups attending the rally had on their persons,  Geller says.  I can assure you that the Virginia State Police personnel were equipped with more-than-adequate specialized tactical and protective gear for the purpose of fulfilling their duties to serve and protect those in attendance of the August 12 event in Charlottesville. McAuliffe claimed in an interview with The New York Times that law enforcement arrived to find a line of militia members who  had better equipment than our State Police had.  In longer comments that were later edited out of the Times  story, McAuliffe said that up to 80 percent of the rally attendees were carrying semi-automatic weapons.  You saw the militia walking down the street, you would have thought they were an army,  he said.

She just made that statement that statues and monuments to two of America s most prominent Founding Fathers, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson,  need to come down. CNN host Kate Bolduan asked Rye if the country s ongoing discussion about race and white supremacy, spurred by the violence in Charlottesville Va. last weekend, is really about Confederate statues and monuments.Rye, a former executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus, said the problem is people are taught American history incorrectly, because they are only told about the  glories  of the country s past, not darker issues like racism.She added that because George Washington and other great American historical figures owned slaves, they deserved to be called out and recognized not for their accomplishments, but for their title of  slave owner. George Washington was a slave owner, and we need to call slave owners out for what they are, whether we think they were protecting American freedom or not,  Rye said.  He wasn t protecting my freedom. My ancestors weren t deemed human beings to him. So to me, I don t care if it s a George Washington statue or a Thomas Jefferson statue or a Robert E. Lee statue.

ANY violence & hate is contemptible pic.twitter.com/fqtomLASmK  Steph (@steph93065) August 16, 2017Senator Rubio probably doesn t visit the Antifa website, but if he did, he might have seen this special credit card sized knife that Antifa was selling on their website for their members to use at Trump rallies to stab people they disagree with:These groups today use SAME symbols & same arguments of #Nazi & #KKK, groups responsible for some of worst crimes against humanity ever 4/6  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) August 15, 2017Mr. President,you can't allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of blame.They support idea which cost nation & world so much pain 5/6  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) August 15, 2017Republican Rep Steven Smith shared a video with Senator Rubio, who apparently needs visual aids to see why President Trump was unwilling to call the violence in Charlottesville  one-sided :Have you seen the video? No police protection, two violent groups. Clearly two, with one blocking the road. How is it one-sided? pic.twitter.com/0W5CYqPT6M  Rep. Steven Smith (@RepStevenSmith) August 16, 2017The #WhiteSupremacy groups will see being assigned only 50% of blame as a win.We can not allow this old evil to be resurrected 6/6  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) August 15, 2017Rubio s third tweet explicitly endorses violent responses to hate speech, but the last one is the money shot, as Rubio embraces the essence of Whataboutism and agrees with the media that left-wing thuggery is a fact on the Charlottesville ground that must be ignored if we are to properly condemn white nationalism.McCain and Romney are politically irrelevant, but Rubio still has political ambitions. Imagine the priceless look of surprise on his face when he gets branded a Nazi because he favors pro-growth tax cuts, free-market reforms, or balks at allowing illegal aliens to vote. He ll be so astounded at the way  hate speech  is expanded to cover his policy positions, and how the next wave of Antifa thugs justifies a violent response.

OOPS! NY GOV CUOMO Announces Statues of Confederate Generals “Will Be Removed Because NY Stands Against Racism”…IGNORES STATE Was Named After OWNER of African Slave Trading Company,"Really Andrew? Does all of New York really stand against racism? Isn t  Al Sharpton, one of the greatest race agitators of all time, a resident of New York? Wasn t he one of Barack Obama s generals in the race war he spent eight years orchestrating from our White House? Wasn t Al Sharpton behind the massive march in New York City where organizers held bull horns calling for the death of police officers? Where was your selective outrage when Al Sharpton was one of the most frequent visitors to our White House?Who could forget the infamous  Beer Summit,  where former President Barack Obama hosted Prof Henry Gates, a prominent black scholar, and Sgt James Crowley, a white police sergeant, for beers in the White House Rose Garden, that was actually a photo-op for Obama where he pretended to be working towards the goal of defusing racial tension in America.And now, as though the last 8 years of race agitating from the highest office in the land never happened, Governor Andrew Cuomo s joining the leftist mob in an attempt to erase American history, foolishly believing that if Democrats are seen as the party removing confederate statues, perhaps Americans will forget that the Democrat Party was in fact, the party who fought so hard to keep slavery alive in America.Here s the ridiculous tweet from Governor Andrew Cuomo:Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson will be removed from the CUNY hall of great Americans because New York stands against racism.  Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) August 17, 2017Sean Davis, co-founder of The Federalist quickly schooled the leftist governor on the history behind the naming of the state of New York:New York is named after the head of a British slave-trading monopoly. https://t.co/edp3ZzYWyr  Sean Davis (@seanmdav) August 17, 2017The Duke of York was the main shareholder in and the director of the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading in Africa; established at the time of the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660. The shareholders in this Company were a combination of the Stuart Royal family along with a number of wealthy London merchants. The Company established London s monopoly of the English slave trade. It created slave ports on the West coast of Africa where British-produced goods were exchanged for Africans who were then transported as slaves to colonies in the Caribbean and the Americas.In 1664, the Duke of York, as Admiral of the Navy, annexed the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam (it was then renamed New York in his honour). When the Duke took over New York one of the first actions of the new authority was to grant the colony port privileges and the right to use warehouses to ships engaged in the slave trade (1) ~ i.e. ships owned by the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading in Africa in which the Duke was the largest shareholder.Previously, under the Dutch West India Company, the African slaves of New Amsterdam had lived in what was known as  half-freedom ; that is to say under the Dutch they had some rights and some, limited, independence. However, once under Stuart, British rule they became chattel slaves (i.e perceived as personal property of the slave owners in a way that was different from previous slave-systems. It was slavery used as labour under an emerging and consolidating capitalism). Though it is worth noting that these urban slaves of New York never accepted the complete servitude endured by their rural counterparts.President Trump took to Twitter this morning to denounce decisions being made by leftists in positions of authority to erase the history of our great nation:Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You ..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017 can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson   who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!

BRAINIAC PROTESTERS VANDALIZE…Attempt to Take Down ‘Peace’ Monument,"This is what mob rule does It s lawless idiots who decided to vandalize and tear down a  Peace  Monument in Atlanta. Has it come to this? Where does this end?THE PARAGRAPH BELOW FROM THE AJC IS THE MOST DISTURBING:A protester was hurt by metal falling from the edifice as the group tried to tear it down, AJC photographer John Spink reported Sunday night. Tensions rose as the lone policeman on the scene was surrounded by black-clad Antifa protesters shouting  pig.  Black Lives Matter protesters put themselves between the police officer and the Antifa crowd, and the gathering soon dispersed.Protesters vandalized and attempted to take down the Peace Monument in Piedmont Park in Atlanta on Sunday, mistaking it for a pro-Confederate statue. The protesters were marching in response to the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday where one woman died after being deliberately hit by a car, and two law enforcement personnel were killed when the helicopter they were in crashed. The Atlanta march traveled from Woodruff Park to Piedmont Park Sunday, where some damaged the Peace Monument, erected in 1911,  a blog on the Atlanta Journal-Constitution website said.  The sculpture features an angel standing above a Confederate soldier, guiding him to lay down his weapon. But the memorial attacked by protesters   some dressed in black and wearing masks   was erected to encourage healing and reconciliation. ATLANTA HISTORY BUFF FILLS US IN:  These guys realized a national healing needed to take place,  said Kennedy, a history buff who keeps the three-volume set  The Chronicles of the Old Guard  on his bookshelf.  They organized a peace tour of the North, which is really remarkable. These were guys who fought in the Civil War, against Union troops. They would go meet with Union soldiers and began to repair those fissures the war created. It speaks to what we call the Atlanta spirit.

ICELAND PROUDLY CLAIMS TO HAVE “ERADICATED” Down Syndrome…In Most Gruesome Way Imaginable,"Mainstream news channels rarely draw attention to the negative side of abortion, but CBS News did so this week with a report about Iceland s near 100-percent abortion rate for babies with Down syndrome.  few countries have come as close to eradicating Down syndrome births as Iceland,  the report begins.  Since prenatal screening tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, the vast majority of women   close to 100 percent   who received a positive test for Down syndrome terminated their pregnancy. Just a handful of children with Down syndrome have been born in Iceland in the past decade. Two are born each year, on average, but the rest are killed in the womb. For most of the children who were born, their mothers decided not to have prenatal screening tests.This deadly discrimination against babies with disabilities is a problem in countries across the world, not just Iceland. In 2014, the Danish government reported 98 percent of unborn babies who tested positive for Down syndrome were aborted. CBS reports the rate in France was 77 percent in 2015, 90 percent in the United Kingdom and 67 percent in the U.S. between 1995 and 2011. Some put the rate even higher in the United States, but it is difficult to determine the exact number because the U.S. government does not keep detailed statistics about abortion.In many of these countries, late-term abortions are legal in cases of fetal anomalies, such as Down syndrome. The UK, for example, prohibits abortions after 24 weeks but allows wide exceptions for late-term abortions involving fetal anomalies.Iceland hospital counselor Helga Sol Olafsdottir does not see any problem with the fact that so many women are having their unborn babies aborted because of Down syndrome. This systematic discrimination is simply a  woman s choice  in her mind.The issue is not gray. It s very clearly wrong, says Penny Nace, president and CEO of Concerned Women for America. This is eugenics and barbarianism at best,  Nace said.  These individuals have no less worth than anyone else. Iceland and many other countries are killing human beings in abortions simply because they have a disability. Down syndrome varies in severity, but most people with the genetic disorder live into their 60s. Some even live on their own, hold down jobs, go to college and get married.For entire story   Life News",politics,"Aug 16, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
BALTIMORE PURGES CONFEDERATE STATUES In Dark Of Night…MAYOR Explains: “I did not want to endanger people in my own city”,"In a city whose former Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, told police officers to  stand down  in the middle of a full-blown riot started by Black Lives Matter activists, Baltimore s new mayor Catherine Pugh, has now ordered the city to be whitewashed of any history that pertains to the Civil War era.In a stealth purging of history, the city of Baltimore removed four Confederate statues from city property under cover of night early Tuesday morning.City crews began the destruction of the monuments just before midnight and finished by 5:30 a.m., the Hill reported.The city council quietly approved the removal late on Monday in a unanimous vote. It s done,  Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh told the Baltimore Sun.  They needed to come down. My concern is for the safety and security of our people. We moved as quickly as we could. I did not want to endanger people in my own city,  the African American mayor said.  I had begun discussions with contractors and so forth about how long it would take to remove them. I am a responsible person, so we moved as quickly as we could.    Breitbart NewsBaltimore Sun: Pugh declined to say how much it cost to remove the statues, or where they had been taken. She said the city would provide cost details soon, but planned to keep the location of the statues secret to avoid conflict.The monuments were loaded onto flatbed trucks and hauled away before sunrise Wednesday, bringing an abrupt end to more than two years of indecision across two mayoral administrations.The four monuments   the Lee-Jackson Monument, a monument to Chief Justice Roger B. Taney at Mount Vernon Place, the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument on Mount Royal Avenue and the Confederate Women s Monument on West University Parkway ",politics,"Aug 16, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
THE PURGE: NYC Mayor De Blasio to Review ‘All Symbols of Hate” on City Property,"THE PURGE CONTINUES THE NYC MAYOR has just opened a can of worms so big that it ll be hard to control it. He wants to review  all symbols of hate  on city property then leave it to his panel of  experts  to decide what stays and what goes. This should be interesting. Isn t this subjective? Someone might think one thing is a symbol of hate but not another. Where does this purging end?Mayor de Blasio said late Wednesday that the city will conduct a 90-day review of  all symbols of hate on city property  in the wake of violence sparked by white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend.A 32-year-old woman was killed and more than a dozen people were injured when a vehicle slammed into a group of counter-protesters on Saturday, and two state troopers died when the helicopter from which they were monitoring events suddenly crashed.Opposition to the removal of a statue of Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee was at the heart of rallies by white nationalists and KKK members in Charlottesville this year.New York City officials said they re putting together a panel of  relevant experts and community leaders  who will define the criteria and make recommendations for which items to remove.EXPERTS? WHO SAYS?MEANWHILE IN THE EAST VILLAGEThe South is rising   in the East Village.Residents are seeing red over a pair of Confederate flags hanging in the window of an East 8th Street apartment building, following the deadly white power rally in Virginia this week.The flags have been hanging in the fifth-floor window of the building near the corner of Avenue D for months, but anger is boiling over in the aftermath of the weekend s carnage   with neighbors pelting rocks and bricks at the window Wednesday morning. They re scary, we don t know who we are dealing with in the neighborhood. I feel uncomfortable because that represents evil. I see the protests in the news and I come home and see this,  said local Louise Abddhal, 56, as a chorus of others yelled at the window.Residents had turned a blind eye to the offensive banners in the past, but started getting mad after Saturday s rally in Charlottesville, where a neo-Nazi fatally mowed down counter-protester Heather Hayer. It s been there forever and no one said anything. Now it s going crazy. Virginia is bringing more light and attention too,  said longtime resident Janet Brown. .The Dixie-head has changed the flags around several times   there was a  neo-Nazi  one for awhile, according to Brown   and he now has two Israeli flags and an American flag between the Confederate ones.But the baffling collection is just making residents angrier. He is a Jew with a Confederate flag! Are you kidding me?  said one neighbor, who wouldn t give his name. Confederate flags in the window, bro! That is a bunch of racists. Right here in the avenue, bro! In the hood! This sh-t is real. He is looking to start a f ing riot. The building s property manager said he s aware of the flags and is trying to get the resident to take them down.Footage of a man throwing rocks and screaming expletives at the windows on Wednesday morning shows police arriving and telling him to stop   but witnesses say cops didn t make any arrests.Via: NYP",politics,"Aug 16, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
“I DID THE RIGHT THING” Pro-North Korea Communist Helped Pull Down Confederate Statue…NOTE: It’s NOT About the Statues!,"A member of the Worker s World Party pulled down the statue in Durham, NC. It s really not about the statues It s a culture war and a leftist revolution. In other words, this is serious business to the organized communist groups who became emboldened during Obama s 8 years in office. TheY don t want the  progress  to stop. The  progress  is destroying capitalism and making America more socialist and communist leaning. Don t believe us? Check out the WWP and you ll see it s another name for the communist party in America: Worker s World PartyMISSION: DESTROY AMERICAOne of the activists who toppled a Confederate statue in Durham, N.C., on Monday night is a member of an extreme leftist group that supports the totalitarian regime in North Korea and wants to abolish capitalism. COPS & KLAN GO HAND IN HAND Taqiyah Thompson, a student at North Carolina Central University, was arrested Tuesday following a press conference in which she defended the actions of the demonstrators and equated police officers to Confederate soldiers and Ku Klux Klan members. I did the right thing,  she said.  Everyone who was there   the people did the right thing. The people will continue to keep making the right choices until every Confederate statue is gone, until white supremacy is gone. That statue is where it belongs. It needs to be in the garbage. Thompson is a member of the Worker s World Party (WWP), a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist group originally formed in 1959 as a hard-line offshoot of the more moderate Socialist Workers Party. In addition to supporting a wide range of far-left causes, the group also defends the North Korean regime of dictator Kim Jong-Un against alleged U.S. imperialism.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"Aug 16, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

“ALT-LEFT” PROFESSOR Makes Outrageous Claim: Flag-Burning Antifa ‘Preserving Fabric of America’ [Video],"Political grandstanding has become a blood sport It s obvious that the CNN anchor set up the question so Dyson s answer could be to  slaughter  our president with his words shameful! Professor Dyson and Mitt Romney (who supports Antifa) are CLUELESS!Dyson:  This man is lethally ignorant, incapable of even having a kindergartner s comprehension of race. For those who say look, the confederacy is about history and heritage, it is. The history and heritage of racism! The history and heritage of bigotry. Building their sense of biological and in many cases theological and national identity upon a lie, a mythology of white supremacy. The belief that some people are inherently superior and some people are inherently inferior.For the president then to defend the actions against taking down Robert E. Lee, or Stonewall Jackson   remember, these people hated America enough to want the secede from it. The people that we claim, black lives matter, the antifa movement and so on, are interested in preserving the fabric of America. Mr. Miller says again, that there was violence there, but the problem is to equate that violence in reaction to the bigotry, with the bigotry itself is to misunderstand the fact that when you go to cancer treatment, the radiation is tough treatment, but it is meant to remove the cancer.So what he fails to understand and what the president especially fails to understand is that you are complicit with the worst currents of bigotry in this country when you try to draw a false equivalence between secessionists, racists and confederate defenders and bigots and Neo-Nazis and African-American and white people and others who have defended the rights of this nation to really seek a path of healing beyond the consternation we see now. That s the problem with this president, he ain t got the right moral vision, he doesn t have the right words to express that moral vision and he lacks an understanding of American history. This is the most illiterate, incompetent president in the history of this nation and it shows and it tells on him in the midst of this racial crisis where he is incapable of showing basic decent compassion for those who are vulnerable and who are victims of white supremacy in this country.

COLLEGE HOLDS EARLY SEGREGATED ORIENTATION To Help ONLY Minority Students With Financial Aid and Schedules,"THIS IS EXPECTED FROM THIS LEFTY COLLEGE Will it trickle out to other colleges? Participants were able to move in before most other students.  Privilege much? Victimhood translates to doing exactly what the  so called  victims fought against .Go figureThe University of California, Berkeley invited certain  special populations  of new students to move in a day early to attend racially-exclusive orientation sessions.According to a guide to the new  Golden Bear Orientation  program, the school offered a special programming on Monday for a variety of populations, including Hispanic students, black students, Native American students, and Asian American/Pacific Islander students. We want all our students to make it to orientation and to have an accessible and equitable experience.  Tweet This Most other students,  meanwhile, spent the day moving into their residence halls and preparing for the main freshman orientation program, which runs from August 15-22.The  Black Student Orientation  aimed to address  the specific transitional and community needs of African American/Black students  at the university with  community building activities, academic and campus life workshops, and a resource fair. As part of the  Black Student Orientation,  students participated in a  Black World Tour  in which they were taken around the surrounding area for a showcase of  black owned businesses. [RELATED: Black Harvard grads to hold separate commencement ceremony]Similarly, a  Familia Orientation  was offered for  Chicanx and Latinx  students on August 13, while an  Asian American Pacific Islander Student Orientation  was reserved for responding to the  specific transitional and community needs of Asian American, Pilipinx , and Pacific Islander students. A final  special population  orientation was provided for  native students  enrolled at the elite institution, who were encouraged to show up early to  map locations of your classes, get to know campus, meet continuing Cal Native students and other new Native students, and have a little fun before classes start. In fact, the Native American Student Development Office touts on its website that  another bonus  of attending the exclusive orientation was being  eligible for early move-in,  a benefit that the African American Student Development Center similarly advertises on its website, noting that participants were able to move in before  most other students.

#CHARLOTTESVILLE’S Vice-Mayor Disrespects Trump…Here’s Why He Refuses to Call Him President Trump [Video],"How in the world did this racist thug get elected? He s disgusting! He kept calling POTUS  45  then Chris Cuomo asked why he was doing that His answer is idiotic and disrespectful:  That s just what I call him. I believe that when he begins to act as if he deserves to be in that office, and leads in terms of unifying people, then he will deserve the name of President Trump. But at this point, I believe that he has not done the things in regards to bringing this country together. CHRIS CUOMO: Do you believe the president helped with what he said yesterday?WES BELLAMY: I believe that 45 did make some strides in regards to specifically condemning the white supremacists and the KKK . . . I would love to move away from the remarks and comments of 45 and focus more on what s going on here on the ground in Charlottesville . . . So again, I m not as concerned with what 45 is doing, I m more concerned with us progressing as a community.CHRIS CUOMO: Wes, quick question. Why do you refer to the president as 45? Yes, he is the 45th president, but is that intentional, or is that just a quick term.BELLAMY: Well, that s just what I call him. I believe that when he begins to act as if he deserves to be in that office, and leads in terms of unifying people, then he will deserve the name of President Trump. But at this point, I believe that he has not done the things in regards to bringing this country together, he has not done the things in regards to making us a more unified place. Nor has he decided to condemn the individuals in a rapid pace, or as he should, or speak out in the way we believe he should. But again, I m not here to talk about 45.BELLAMY IS A KNOWN RACIST BUT CBS IS COMPLICIT WITH THEIR DESIRE TO CENSOR BELLAMY S RACIST TWEETS: CBS reporter Jan Crawford interviewed BELLAMY in her April 13 Evening News segment about the Robert E. Lee statue at the center of Charlottesville  controversy. Crawford downplayed the racist comments and made no mention of Bellamy s punishment for the disgusting tweets he sent (see below) His past tweets suggest that he was part of the race problem. But CBS purposefully minimized his history, shifting the blame onto the vice mayor s opponents.  Supporters of the statue unearth crude tweets written by Bellamy as a younger man,  Crawford noted,  and he also was targeted with death threats, but Bellamy feels his fight is justified. Just what kinds of  crude  things did Bellamy say? There were racist tweets, such as his comment in 2009:  I DON T LIK WHIT PEOPLE SO I HATE WHITE SNOW!!!!! FML!!!!  And his 2010 tweet:  I really #hate how almost 80% of the black people here talk white. There were inappropriate and crude tweets. The same year, he tweeted:  ALRIGHT. My phone goin ham. Lol. THERE IS A DIFF BETWEEN ASS& EATIN PUSSY!!! I repeat THERE IS A DIFF BETWEEN ASS& EATIN PUSSY! There were also sexist posts.

How dare they demand anything of us This terrorist group should be named and shamed.The Daily Caller reported:Nihad Awad, CAIR s national executive director, urged state and local governments to erase every symbol and every vestige of Confederate history immediately. A fitting response to the deadly terror attack on anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville would be for officials in states and cities nationwide to immediately announce that every street, every school, every flag, and every public memorial honoring those who took up arms in defense of white supremacy and slavery will be removed or have its name changed to instead honor those who fought for civil rights,  Awad said in a statement to The Daily Caller. Removal of these memorials would be a small step forward in turning the page on the darkest period in our nation s history,  Awad also said.THE CAIR TEMPLATE FOR ERASING OUR HISTORY AS AMERICANS:Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) Resolution Template Requesting the Removal of All Confederate Memorials, Flags, Street Names, and Symbols from Public Spaces and Property August XX, 2017Requesting the Removal of All Confederate Memorials, Flags, Street Names, and Symbols from Public Spaces and Property Whereas the preservation of these memorials validates the subjugation experienced by African-Americans due to their size, prominent placement and public display;  Whereas the investments and arrangement made to recognize Confederate figures communicates core beliefs that promote the endurance of white supremacy and racism;  Whereas every Confederate memorial, flag, street name, and symbol proclaims the injustices and suffering experienced by African-Americans as insignificant and dismissible;  Whereas every Confederate memorial, flag, street name, and symbol commemorates and honors those who fought to enslave African-Americans;  Whereas every Confederate memorial, flag, street name, and symbol diminishes the numerous contributions and services African-Americans made, and continue to make, to the United States;  Whereas every Confederate memorial, flag, street name, and symbol celebrates individuals who campaigned against giving African-Americans their rights and liberty;  Whereas every public symbol that references the Confederacy in the United States glorifies individuals who sought to divide the nation and preserve white supremacy;  Whereas the removal of all memorials, flags, street names, and symbols of Confederacy from public spaces and property reaffirms to the public, especially African-Americans and other minority groups, that we do not endorse the ideals these objects represent;  Whereas the removal of all public references to the Confederacy would respect the entitlement of African-Americans and others to equal protection of their civil and human rights;YADA, YADA, YADA ",politics,"Aug 15, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
HERE WE GO: GEORGIA POLITICIAN Calls for Removal of Stone Mountain’s Giant Carving of Confederate Leaders: “A blight on our state”,"The politicians are using our monuments to history as bargaining chips to gain votes. It s sickening to see the back and forth with the cowardly bunch of lily livered sellouts who would rather win their seat than fight for what the people want. Yes, the people WANT to keep these incredible statues and carvings because anyone with half a brain knows you should never erase the past EVER! If we erase our history, who are we?    Pat BuchananIt s heartbreaking to see these pieces of our history torn apart or removed to gather dust somewhere. What s wrong with these politicians in Georgia who are bowing to the liberal elites? Stand up for those who have relatives both black and white who fought in the Civil War. Shame on you!PANDERING FOR VOTES USING OUR MONUMENTS AS COLLATERAL Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams called for the removal of the giant carving that depicts three Confederate war leaders on the face of state-owned Stone Mountain, saying it  remains a blight on our state and should be removed. We must never celebrate those who defended slavery and tried to destroy the union,  Abrams said in a series of tweets posted early Tuesday, a response to the deadly violence sparked by white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, Va.Removing the faces of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson would take a monster of a sandblaster and require a change in state law. The Georgia code has a clear mandate for the memorial, saying it should be  preserved and protected for all time as a tribute to the bravery and heroism of the citizens of this state who suffered and died in their cause. Lawmakers and civil rights groups have called for the removal of Confederate symbols at the memorial for years. After the 2015 shooting deaths of nine black worshipers by a white supremacist in Charleston, several legislators pushed for a boycott until Rebel flags at the site come down.Georgia leaders have embraced recent changes to distance the state from its Rebel history.Gov. Nathan Deal quietly struck Confederate Memorial Day from the state s official holiday calendar and removed the statue of a segregationist leader from the state grounds. State-issued license plates featuring the Rebel emblem have been altered, though only slightly. Statues and paintings of Confederate leaders in the statehouse are facing fresh criticism. And the state is set to unveil a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. outside the Capitol this month.Four high-profile Republicans are in the race, and several were critical of her stance. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle said the state has taken  great strides  to add exhibits that give a more inclusive view of the Civil War. Instead of dividing Georgians with inflammatory rhetoric for political gain,  he said,  we should work together to add to our history, not take from it.

The angry shopper posted a photo of the mannequins on Facebook, saying a number of people refused to do anything when they spotted the outstretched arms reminiscent of the Nazi salute.Belk told ABC the store was reviewing its surveillance footage.

He said it s  game on  if North Korea fires missiles at Guam.  If they shoot at the United States, I m assuming they hit the United States. If they do that, then it s game on,  Mattis said.  I think if they fire at the United States, it could escalate into war very quickly, yes. That s called war, if they shoot at us. Mattis then said,  Let s not do this, OK, folks? Let s not start saying,  General Mattis said it s war,   Secretary Mattis said it s war,  War is up to the president, perhaps up to the Congress. The bottom line is we will defend the country from an attack. It s not that I m over here, you know, Dr. Strangelove, you know, doing things like that, OK? Mattis made the point that he would know within minutes if a missile was fired towards the U.S. He said,  We ll take it out. You don t shoot at people in this world, unless you want to bear the consequences. OK? All right. THERE YOU GO! THIS IS A VERY STRONG REBUKE TO THE THREATS AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED.

"CAN YOU HEAR HIM NOW? President Trump Doubles Down: Condemns ‘Evil’ KKK, White Supremacists, Neo-Nazis [Video and Transcript]","President Trump condemned hate groups today AGAIN! Yes, it seems the left didn t hear the president the first time around. They needed their own special speech but they ll still find something to complain about. Allowing Trump to be a good guy just doesn t fit their narrative. No matter how beautiful the speech was today, the Democrats will continue the rhetoric against Trump The last thing they want is a united America THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I m in Washington today to meet with my economic team about trade policy and major tax cuts and reform. We are renegotiating trade deals and making them good for the American worker. And it s about time.Our economy is now strong. The stock market continues to hit record highs, unemployment is at a 16-year low, and businesses are more optimistic than ever before. Companies are moving back to the United States and bringing many thousands of jobs with them. We have already created over one million jobs since I took office.We will be discussing economic issues in greater detail later this afternoon, but, based on the events that took place over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, I would like to provide the nation with an update on the ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everyone.I just met with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the deadly car attack that killed one innocent American and wounded 20 others. To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend s racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered.As I said on Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence. It has no place in America.And as I have said many times before: No matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal. We are equal in the eyes of our Creator. We are equal under the law. And we are equal under our Constitution. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.Two days ago, a young American woman, Heather Heyer, was tragically killed. Her death fills us with grief, and we send her family our thoughts, our prayers, and our love.We also mourn the two Virginia state troopers who died in service to their community, their commonwealth, and their country. Troopers Jay Cullen and Burke Bates exemplify the very best of America, and our hearts go out to their families, their friends, and every member of American law enforcement.These three fallen Americans embody the goodness and decency of our nation. In times such as these, America has always shown its true character: responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.As a candidate, I promised to restore law and order to our country, and our federal law enforcement agencies are following through on that pledge. We will spare no resource in fighting so that every American child can grow up free from violence and fear. We will defend and protect the sacred rights of all Americans, and we will work together so that every citizen in this blessed land is free to follow their dreams in their hearts, and to express the love and joy in their souls.Thank you.

WATCH: CONSERVATIVE PRO-FREE SPEECH Activist May Go Blind After Leftist Agitators Throw ACID IN HIS EYES at Charlottesville Rally…Leftists Tweet “I hope you go blind”," Baked Alaska  is a former liberal who wrote for the ultra-liberal Buzzfeed publication.  He s now a conservative activist and Trump supporter who regularly attends pro-Trump and free-speech rallies to document the violence from the Left, and to show his support for his fellow conservatives.Baked Alaska attended the Charlottesville rally this weekend to peacefully show his support for free speech and was met, not surprisingly, by violence from leftist thugs. The type of violence he encountered however, wasn t your run of the mill George Soros funded Antifa gang violence, it was more like the kind of violence you see in the Middle East by Muslim extremists. Baked Alaska was walking down the sidewalk filming the activities at the protest, he was met by protestors screaming,  Black Lives Matter!  Within seconds of encountering this very large group of protesters, Baked Alaska can be heard screaming that he was sprayed with  pepper spray  in the eyes.As it turns out, Baked Alaska was actually sprayed in the eyes with ACID.Shorty after the incident, Baked Alaska tweeted about the horrific act of violence committed against him:Hospital has sent me to the ER, I was told there's a large possibility I'll have permanent eye damage. Keep me in your prayers thank you fam  Baked Alaska  (@bakedalaska) August 13, 2017Here is one of Baked Alaska s friends updating his supporters on his condition.

WAKE UP! GEORGE SOROS “Drastically Ramps Up” Effort To Destroy America,"George Soros is trying his best to destroy America! He is ramping up his efforts now! James Woods said it best when he tweeted that Soros would be happy with what happened in Charlottesville: Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement that there would be an investigation into what happened in Charlottesville. We re hoping Sessions digs deep! If AG Jeff Sessions doesn t dig deep ASAP to uncover Soros  involvement in Antifa and BLM, then this Soros-funded war will continue. We need a fighter to win the battle against this evil Hungarian globalist!Liberal billionaire George Soros s advocacy arm is ramping up its lobbying efforts this year, disclosure forms show.SOROS WANTS OPEN BORDERS AND GLOBALISM:The amount Soros spent on lobbying shot up to $11 million in 2013, a drastic increase from the $3.4 million the group had spent in 2012. The uptick could be attributed to the group s push for  comprehensive immigration reform  during this time.The Open Society Policy Center, a D.C.-based nonprofit that focuses on advocacy efforts and is a separate entity from the Soros grant making Open Society Foundations, has spent nearly as much on lobbying in the first half of 2017 as the group did in the entirety of 2016.The Open Society Policy Center reported spending $4.6 million in the first and second quarters, which runs from Jan. 1 to June 30, according its disclosure forms filed to the House of Representatives and the Senate.THREE IN-HOUSE LOBBYISTS? The group has three in-house lobbyists who lobby the U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, National Security Council, the Department of Defense, and the Department of State.Soros even  tried to influence the decision of the Supreme court on immigration according to The Daily Caller:Open Society Foundations, Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros  stated vehicle for progressive social change, orchestrated a well-funded attempt to secure a desired outcome in a U.S. Supreme Court case on illegal immigration enforcement, according to a newly discovered memo between the organization s top U.S. officials and board members.Soros drastically extended the policy scope of his lobbying efforts as the year progressed, including to issues that have been seen as a direct strike against the Hungarian-born billionaire.IF HUNGARY (SOROS  HOME COUNTRY) CAN TRY AND BAN HIS GOV T INTERFERENCE, WHY CAN T WE?From January to March, Soros s group lobbied on three issues. From April to June, the group lobbied 17 different issues, including the Bill on Foreign Funded Organizations in Hungary (LexNGo), Hungary s crack down on foreign-funded organizations in the country.Hungary s parliament approved the law that targets foreign-funded organizations in June, which they have said  can threaten the country s political and economic interests and interfere with the functioning of its institutions,  according to text of the law.Although the law does not mention Soros by name, politicians in Hungary previously said they wanted to  sweep out  organizations tied to Soros.Soros s Open Society Foundations has given money to a number of prominent NGOs in Hungary. The group has said that the country s bill  seeks to suppress democratic voices in Hungary. The lobbyists also worked on issues such as the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2017 and the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018, among others.Soros s lobbying efforts have quietly skyrocketed in recent years.The policy center reported spending $19,120,000 on lobbying for policy and legislative efforts with Congress and government agencies between 2002 and 2012, which averages out to $1.9 million per year.WE HAD A PUPPET MASTER PULLING THE STRINGS IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR 8 YEARS!

"MEDIA WON’T SHOW VIDEO Of Trump Telling Matt Lauer David Duke Is A “Bigot” and A “Racist…IGNORES HILLARY’S Ties To Former KKK Leader, Democrat Senator Robert Byrd","It is awfully ironic how the liberals are bashing President Trump for placing blame on both sides for the violence in the Charlottesville incident and not condemning just the white supremacists, considering they conveniently overlooked Hillary and Obama s close friendship with former KKK member, Robert Byrd.Following the Charlottesville incident involving a car crashing into a crowd of people, President Trump seemed to be one of the only figures in the country condemning both sides for their displays of violence and bigotry. It was not clear who, exactly, was behind the attack, or which group was responsible.Trump waited until the dust settled and condemned both sides, as both sides warrant condemnation in this situation: from the white supremacists to the black supremacists, to the Communists, to Antifa, the situation was hardly one-sided.David Duke attempted to link Trump to the bigotry and hatred that was present in Charlottesville, however, it would be a far cry to say that the President is in any way happy with or affiliated with Duke or those he associates with, and to say so is to insult the President and his supporters.However, President Trump, back when he was dropping out of the Reform Party primary in 2000, condemned David Duke.When pressed by Matt Lauer on why he saw the Reform Party as self-destructing, Trump commented: Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party.   Gateway PunditWatch Trump s 2000 interview with Lauer here:Despite mounting criticism for Donald Trump s failure to disavow former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke s support, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton once heaped praise for late Klan leader Sen. Robert Byrd.In a video uploaded to the State Department s official YouTube page on June 28, 2010, Clinton commemorated late Sen. Byrd by saying,  Today our country has lost a true American original, my friend and mentor Robert C. Byrd. Via: Daily CallerAnd when the former KKK member, Senator Robert Byrd died, Barack Obama gave the eulogy:President Obama lauded the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd today for keeping faith with his family, his state of West Virginia and his beloved U.S. Constitution. He was a Senate icon, he was a party leader, he was an elder statesman, and he was my friend,  Obama told thousands who gathered for Byrd s funeral on the steps of the golden-domed West Virginia statehouse.

HERE YOU GO! TRUMP CONDEMNS DAVID DUKE…Calls Him A “Bigot” and A “Racist” [Video],"Following the situation in Charlottesville, Trump was one of the very few people to call out all sides for displays of violence and bigotry: white supremacists, black supremacists, Communists, and Antifa. In short, this flurry of frustration was far from one-sided.Amidst all of the chaos, David Duke tried to link Trump to the bigotry and violence that was present in Charlottesville. This is certainly interesting considering the fact that Trump called Duke out on his own bigotry nearly seventeen years ago. In an interview with Matt Lauer in 2000, Trump condemned Duke while being questioned about his reasons for dropping out of the Reform Party primary.Trump attributed the party s  self-destructing  nature to the people involved with it, specifically Duke. When pressed on this matter by Lauer, Trump responded,  Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party. Further proof that Trump is never afraid to call a spade a spade, or a racist a racist.Read more: The Gateway Pundit",politics,"Aug 13, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Of course, the media is blaming Donald Trump for the horrific accident that he clearly had nothing to do with. As a side note, does anyone remember the media blaming former President Barack Obama when the city of Ferguson, MO was burned to the ground by Black Lives Matter rioters? Yeah, either do we.But what about the black woman who INTENTIONALLY drove her car into a crowded street on the strip in Las Vegas with her 3-year old toddler in the back seat? Does anyone even remember this happening?In December 2015, Las Vegas police say a 24 year old woman, with her 3 year old toddler in the back seat, intentionally drove her vehicle into a crowded Las Vegas strip with the intention of running people over. Here s the story MSNBC published that was written by the Associated Press. The AP doesn t waste any time attempting to gain sympathy for the driver, and in only the third paragraph of the story, the AP want to make it perfectly clear that the reader knows she may not be guilt of intentional homicide. They re quick to quote the murderer s defense lawyer who told them,  Just because she s charged, doesn t mean she s guilty From the AP article:A woman accused of intentionally plowing a car carrying her child through crowds of pedestrians on a Las Vegas Strip sidewalk is distraught and overwhelmed, her defense attorney said after she briefly appeared in court for the first time.Lakeisha Nicole Holloway, 24, pursed her lips and blinked as she was led in shackles into a courtroom. She was not asked to enter a plea but nodded to acknowledge that she would remain in jail through the holidays while both sides investigate Sunday s crash that killed an Arizona woman and injured dozens of others. This is sad and tragedy for everybody involved,  defense lawyer Joseph Abood said after the hearing, adding,  Just because she s charged, doesn t mean she s guilty. A woman with her 3-year-old daughter in the car smashed into crowds of visitors on the Las Vegas Strip, then drove to a hotel and told a valet to call 911 after killing a woman from Arizona and injuring at least 35 others, including at least five Canadians, police said.People jumped on the car and banged on its windows, but Lakeisha N. Holloway, 24, would not stop driving on the sidewalk, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo told reporters. Video appeared to show the crash in front of the Paris and Planet Hollywood casino-hotels was intentional, he said.The 1996 Oldsmobile sedan was fully on the sidewalk twice Sunday night, including once when it traveled for 200 feet, police said. The child in the car was not hurt.The 24-year-old told police told she was homeless and tired, and denied using drugs or alcohol. Holloway also told police she had been unable to rest or sleep because security officers kept running her and her daughter and her car off casino properties.Here s a look at how MSNBC s parent company NBC covered the horrific Charlottesville incident yesterday. By the third paragraph in the part of the article that describes the accident, MSNBC interviews a witness from the other side of the protest (not the alleged perpetrator s defense lawyer, like in the story above) who clearly states there is no question about the motive or of the driver s guilt:  It was very clearly intentional. NBC: Described as a group of  anti-racist protesters  by a witness who took video of the crash, the group of marchers was packed close together at the end of a street near the intersection of Fourth and Water streets in downtown Charlottesville when the car struck.Brennan Gilmore, a 37-year-old who works for a start up, shot the footage and said he heard tires squealing before he saw a car build up speed and ram the crowd. It hit a number of people before plowing into the bumper of another car. It was very clearly intentional,  Gilmore told NBC News.  From the far end of the street it accelerated, slowed down right before the crowd and then slammed on the gas through the crowd sending bodies flying. And then it reversed back into the street dragging bodies and clothes. And then boom the TRUMP tie-in (which was not really a tie-in at all):Fields  mother, Samantha Bloom, told The Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn t know it was a white nationalist rally. I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump s not a white supremacist,  Bloom told the AP. (The last sentence that includes Fields  mother s statement about Trump NOT being a white supremacist [bold], was omitted from many mainstream media sources, as it didn t fit their narrative.)In February 2017, Holloway was found mentally competent to stand trial after nearly a year committed at Lakes Crossing maximum security psychiatric facility. Holloway then pleaded not guilty in the case. Nearly 3 years later, her case has still not been tried. Lakeisha Holloway faces 71 felony counts in connection to the Dec. 20, 2015 incident that left a woman dead and injured 34 others. Her trial is scheduled to begin on Feb. 5, 2018.If you want to learn more about this case, you ll have to look for updates in local Las Vegas news sources. You won t likely find it being covered by the mainstream media.

NFL’s NEWEST ATTENTION SEEKER Takes Place of Unemployed Kaepernick…Calls Anyone Who Disagrees With Him “RACIST”,"Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch sat during the national anthem over the weekend, ahead of a Saturday preseason game against the Arizona Cardinals, the AP reports.The NFL player was photographed on top of an orange cooler with a banana in Glendale, Ariz.Last year, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat and kneeled during the national anthem and protested police brutality.Lynch previously backed Kaepernick, telling comedian Conan O Brien in September 2016,  I d rather see him take a knee than stand up, put his hands up and get murdered. If you re really not racist then you won t see what he done, what he s doing, as a threat to America, but just addressing a problem that we have,  Lynch said at the time.Raiders coach Jack Del Rio says he didn t know about Lynch s plans ahead of the game, according to NFL.com. On Marshawn, talked to Marshawn trying to make sure we re on the same page,  the coach said.  He said,  This is something I ve done for 11 years. It s not a form of anything other than me being myself.  I said,  So you understand how I feel, I very strongly believe in standing for the national anthem.

H.R. McMaster Repeatedly Refuses to Say if He Can Work with Steve Bannon…A Deep State Set Up? [Video],"Alert! Alinsky tactics at work here! Remember  Pick a Target? Well, the media and Deep State have picked their target Breitbart News has been exposing H.R. McMaster so now the media and Deep State are going hard after Steve Bannon EVEN HARDER THAN THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE. The media and politicians have been targeting Bannon since the election. They ve been calling him all of the usual names like  Nazi  or  White Supremacist . They re clearly afraid of Bannon because he has the media and the left figured out just like Breitbart did. We re hoping Bannon won t get squeezed out by Kelly and McMaster! This could cause a HUGE policy shift for the Trump presidency. Not good, not good at all for Trump supporters who want America back after 8 awful years of Obama.White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster repeatedly refused  say whether he could work with chief strategist Steve Bannon Sunday on  Meet The Press,  dodging the question three times! Three times! This is a Deep State wake up call!IS BANNON ON THE WAY OUT? NOT GOOD!Did you notice that Scaramucci went after President Trump today? AND Steve Bannon? Yes, he was on the morning shows letting it rip on those two!Axios reported Saturday that Bannon has entered President Donald Trump s doghouse and that top officials believe he s part of leaks meant to target McMaster. Bannon was previously executive chairman of Breitbart, and the right-wing website has published a series of stories attacking McMaster in recent weeks.SHOULDN T THE TRUTH COME OUT ON MCMASTER?New Chief of Staff John Kelly has said he will not tolerate the infighting and anonymous comments to the media that characterized predecessor Reince Priebus  tenure, according to Politico.Earlier in the interview, host Chuck Todd asked what was  going on  between him and Bannon. McMaster dismissed the saga as  a lot of noise  and didn t mention Bannon s name.At the end of the interview, Todd repeatedly asked McMaster if he could work together with Bannon, but McMaster wouldn t answer. Can you and Steve Bannon still work together in this White House or not?  Todd asked. I get to work together with a broad range of talented people, and it is a privilege every day to enable the national security team,  McMaster said. You didn t answer. Can you and Steve Bannon work in that same White House?  Todd asked. I am ready to work with anybody who will help advance the president s agenda and advance the security, prosperity of the American people,  McMaster said. Do you believe Steve Bannon does that?  Todd asked. I believe that everyone who works in the White House, who has the privilege, the great privilege every day of serving their nation, should be motivated by that goal,  McMaster said.VIA: WFB ",politics,"Aug 13, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
BLACK MAN CLAIMS He Was KICKED OUT Of Swanky LA Gym Because He Supports President Trump…WATCH Jesse Peterson Tell His Incredible Story,"Equinox Los Angeles, one of the swankiest gyms in America, where celebrities like Chloe Kardashian, Mickey Rourke, Renee Zellweger and Sean Combs have been seen exiting is apparently okay with accepting their exorbitant fees from gym members, as long as they don t support our current President, Donald J. Trump.On their Facebook page, Equinox makes no secret about the fact that transgenders are welcome at their DC location: Members pay $200 to $300 initiation fees and $160 to $250 monthly rates. They rave about the gym s amenities, which include classes taught by former Olympians and spa treatments.Equinox gym makes it pretty clear however, in one of their Facebook posts that they tolerate all people of all beliefs. They actually tell Facebook users that if they have  narrow minds  that they  need not apply . Hmmm .so asking a member to leave because he supports our president isn t  narrow minded? Watch the video below, as one of the sweetest conservative voices in social media, Jesse Lee Peterson tells his story of how he was treated by Equinox Gym in Los Angeles. (The video cuts off part of Jesse s head, but his story is definitely worth listening to.) Conservatives and specifically, conservative Trump supporters are under attack by leftist bullies everywhere. We need to stand strong and stick together. There has never been a more important time to stand your ground and be unafraid of who you are. We cannot allow the Left to bully us into submission.

HUCKABEE BACKS TRUMP’S COMMENTS ON PROTESTS: “Is he supposed to do what Barack Obama used to do and jump to conclusions”,"A voice of reason speaks out! Mike Huckabee told Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro that he has a  special repulsion  for white supremacists and that Trump did the right thing in his statements about Charlottesville. It s part because I m white,  he elaborated.  It s part because I have seen this evil and hateful attitude that elevates some people above others. And as a believing Christian, I m especially offended because anybody who believes The Bible, especially the gospels, will have to accept that there is no way that God is a respecter of persons- as scripture makes clear, He doesn t love some people more than others because of their color, because of their affiliation, even with Him. He mentioned that because he believe in the gospels that  every person has equal worth,  that makes him pro-life.Pirro asked Huckabee if the outrage over the president s remarks are just  Trump haters  who   will look for any reason to dump on  him. Well it seems like a lot of them are, I don t know what they expect the president to do,  Huckabee responded.  At the time that he made the comment, the driver of the car had not even been identified. That s exactly right!  Pirro exclaimed. And so what is he supposed to say?  Huckabee continued.  Is he supposed to do what Barack Obama used to do and jump to conclusion and make a decision like he did in Ferguson. Missouri, which turned out to be totally untrue? The president has to be careful in taking steps. I thought what he condemned was what we all could immediately condemn and that was the violence, the car some coward in a car drove into innocent people to try and kill them. And he condemned that! What else is he supposed to do at that point? Amen!Via: Mediate ",politics,"Aug 12, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
A LOOK INSIDE NORTH KOREA’S Lavish Underground Nuclear Bunker…Is This Why Kim Jong Un Is Unafraid Of Nuclear Conflict? [VIDEO],"A defector from North Korea is cautioning against underestimating Kim Jong Un when it comes to nuclear weapons   and he says President Donald Trump may be key to stopping him.Song Byeok escaped from the North in 2002 and currently resides in South Korea. In a new interview, he told The Independent the threat of nuclear war is real as long as Kim Jong-un is in power. I think Kim Jong Un could wage nuclear war if his power is threatened and that is why he needs to be removed as soon as possible,  he said.The 48-year-old defector used to create propaganda art for the regime, now he creates protest work.  AoLThese pictures show the inside of Pyongyang s 360ft deep metro system   that will double up as a nuclear bunker if war breaks out between North Korea and the US.Images show commuters using the world s deepest underground train system which includes two lines with a combined length of 18 miles beneath North Korea s capital.Construction work on the Pyongyang Metro started in 1968 and was inaugurated in 1973 by Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of current dictator Kim Jong-un.Watch this fascinating look into North Korea by photographer Andrew McLeod: And while it is usually busy with commuters, the depth of the subway system means citizens could also use it as a shelter should tensions between North Korea and America boil over into full-scale war.The trains are old carriages from Germany which were bought up by North Korea in 1999 as they were heading for the scrap heap. Pyongyang now claims the trains were built in North Korea, but despite attempts to conceal their origin, some old graffiti tags can be seen on the carriages.French photographer Eric Lafforgue captured these images during a trip to the hermit state and said there were only 17 stations on two lines.He said the fare was the equivalent of half a US cent  You have to validate your ticket at one of these automatic machines. But they did not work the day I visited. Instead, a train attendant checked was checking the tickets by hand.For entire story: Daily Mail ",politics,"Aug 12, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
#CHARLOTTESVILLE While Media and Politicians Stir the Pot…Are We Missing the Elephant in the Room?,"A tweet caught my eye after exploring all of the hate and violence posted from Charlottesville. Did you dig deeper and do you know: Who Paid For Helmets, Bus Rentals, Body Armor on both sides in Charlottesville? Are we missing the elephant in the room? Is this event being used for political purposes (see VA Gov. McAuliffe video below) to shut down free speech and to denounce President Trump who has NO CONNECTION to any of these radical groups? George Soros must be so proud right now What s missing in all of the news reports is that the group that got permission to rally (we don t agree with them but they got permission to rally) was infiltrated by bussed in Black Lives Matter and Antifa thugs who are very violent. Remember Berkeley? The rally then became a violent mob Was this the plan by the left when they bussed in hundreds in opposition? A perfect scenario for the left Something isn t right here George Soros of MoveOn.org was advertising for protesters too:Antifa is paid by DNC funder George Soros but not one Democrat is being asked to condemn them for Charlottesville  Jack Posobiec   (@JackPosobiec) August 12, 2017The Truth is that Trump supporters and most Americans on both sides reject this violence!

KATIE COURIC TWEETS Disgust After Two Of Her Producers Are Sprayed With Urine At Charlottesville Protest…Doesn’t Mention ANTIFA Thugs Sprayed Them,"Katie Couric took to Twitter to call out Charlottesville, VA protesters who allegedly sprayed urine at two of her producers. What leftist hack Katie Couric doesn t mention is that the protesters who sprayed her producers with urine were actually ANTIFA protesters. By leaving that little factoid out of her tweet, she has clearly attempted to mislead anyone reading her tweet into believing that the offending protesters were part of the white nationalist group. While we strongly condemn any group that believes they are superior because of their race or skin color, these people actually obtained a permit to protest, and until Antifa showed up, their protest was peaceful.Two of my producers just got sprayed with urine.

New Report Shows 3.5 MILLION MORE ADULTS Registered To Vote Than Are Alive…Is This Why Leftist Media Predicted Hillary Would Win? [VIDEO],"WATCH the euphoric reaction of Clinton crony and ABC host George Stephanopoulos discuss the probability of Hillary winning the presidential election against candidate Trump with Nate Silver. According to Stephaopoulos, is rarely incorrect in his predictions. Was Silver considering the effect voter fraud would have on our elections that appears to be almost exclusively favoring Democrats?FAST FORWARD TO August, 2017, as America witnesses one report after anohter of unbelievable voter fraud and/or major voter discrepancies across several states in America.  Americans are finally starting to understand how the Democrats, and their allies in the media were so certain that Hillary would win against the much more popular candidate Donald J. Trump:National Review   Some 3.5 million more people are registered to vote in the U.S. than are alive among America s adult citizens. Such staggering inaccuracy is an engraved invitation to voter fraud.The Election Integrity Project of Judicial Watch   a Washington-based legal-watchdog group   analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau s 2011 2015 American Community Survey and last month s statistics from the federal Election Assistance Commission. The latter included figures provided by 38 states. According to Judicial Watch, eleven states gave the EAC insufficient or questionable information. Pennsylvania s legitimate numbers place it just below the over-registration threshold.My tabulation of Judicial Watch s state-by-state results yielded 462 counties where the registration rate exceeded 100 percent. There were 3,551,760 more people registered to vote than adult U.S. citizens who inhabit these counties. That s enough over-registered voters to populate a ghost-state about the size of Connecticut,  Judicial Watch attorney Robert Popper told me.Take a look at the margin in battle ground states Trump won in 2016, in which Electoral College votes can be decided by incredibly narrow margins. Consider the multitude of ghost voters in:Colorado: 159,373Florida: 100,782Iowa: 31,077Michigan: 225,235New Hampshire: 8,211North Carolina: 189,721Virginia: 89,979(For a deeper dive into these data, please download my spreadsheet here.)President Donald J. Trump s supporters might be intrigued to learn that Hillary Clinton s margins of victory in Colorado (136,386) and New Hampshire (2,736) were lower than the numbers of ghost voters in those states. Clinton s fans should know that Trump won Michigan (10,704) and North Carolina (173,315) by fewer ballots than ghost voters in those states.It s past time to exorcise ghost voters from the polls.Watch Barack Obama criticize Donald Trump for questioning the integrity of the vote: ",politics,"Aug 12, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
VIRGINIA DMV Issues Vulgar License Plate Bashing President Trump…Recall!,"How did this man get this license plate? How did it pass the DMV s rules of no vulgarity? It s obvious that it s a plate that bashes President Trump but someone in the DMV let it pass through. Now he s going to fight for his right to keep an obviously vulgar license plate? Maybe he should grow up and have a decent plate on his car. The Trump-bashing is childish and this guy was a teacher!What does this license plate say? Don Butler of Richmond, a former teacher, says he chose the F and the K because they re the first and last letters of the word flunk, and President Donald Trump has flunked. The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, however, says he needs to give up the plate.The letters FTRU MPK grace the back of his Lexus SUV.But the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles sent Butler a letter demanding he send back the plate because it violates state rules.Butler requested a hearing, and he ll make his case to keep the plate on Monday morning. There s no question that it s an anti-Trump message,  he said in a phone interview Friday.But the former middle school teacher and retired lawyer says he doesn t understand DMV s concern. The F and K in the plate are the first and last letters of the word  flunk,  he said, and that s why he choose them. I think that Trump has flunked miserably,  he said. Apparently they re trying to read something else into it.   I have no idea what they think it means. SUUUUURE!

THESE 11 GOP SENATORS Tweeted Support for McConnell…Primary Them!,"Arrogant and smug is what we d call McConnell when he spoke to a group telling them Trump has  excessive expectations  of government Unbelievable!After 7 years of promises, the Senate leader can t do a thing McConnell should take the blame for the do-nothing Senate!Speaking at a Rotary Club gathering in Kentucky on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vented about how President Donald Trump s lack of political experience has led to him setting  excessive expectations  for legislative priorities.McConnell, R-Ky., told the group in Florence that he found it  extremely irritating  that Congress has earned the reputation of not accomplishing anything. Part of the reason I think that the storyline is that we haven t done much is because, in part, the president and others have set these early timelines about things need to be done by a certain point,  said McConnell, a Republican and the state s senior senator.Trump, a political newcomer, as McConnell noted, has a habit of declaring progress on major priorities that do not necessarily reflect the reality of lawmaking.For example, as the House was in the midst of negotiations about its Obamacare replacement bill in February, Trump announced that Congress was in the  final stages  of its bill and said it would be ready for  submitting  in March. While the House bill was unveiled in March, that chamber didn t vote on it until May, and health care votes continued until the end of July.That sort of disconnect has led to Trump s expressing disappointment when bills   chief among them health care reform   fail to end up on his desk, even though, as with health care, the political reality indicated all along how difficult it was going to be to pass legislation. Our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before. And I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process,  McConnell told the group.  So part of the reason I think people feel we re underperforming is because too many artificial deadlines   unrelated to the reality of the complexity of legislating   may not have been fully understood. President Trump tweeted back to McConnell: GET BACK TO WORK! Here s the list of Republican Senators who went against President Trump: PRIMARY THEM!

SKETCHY FIRM BEHIND SALACIOUS ALLEGATIONS Against Trump Tries to Pull a Fast One on Senate Judiciary Committee,"Remember Fusion GPS (please see our previous report on this below)? They are the opposition research firm behind the Trump  golden showers  dossier that attempted to embarrass the president with untrue stories of sexual escapades. Well, Fusion GPS had been ordered to turn over the dossier to the Senate Judiciary Committee late Wednesday but when they turned them over it was clear Fusion GPS was trying to pull a fast one on the Senate: The committee is reviewing the production received late this afternoon from Mr. Simpson, but virtually all of the documents appear to be merely news clippings rather than records of Fusion s substantive communications. The paltry document production escalates the standoff between Fusion GPS and the Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley.After Simpson declined an invitation to testify before the committee last month, Grassley issued a subpoena to compel him to appear. But the subpoena was withdrawn after Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, said he would voluntarily meet in a closed session with committee staff.A date for that meeting has not been set. WHY NOT???Last month, the committee requested records from Fusion GPS, the Trump campaign, Donald Trump Jr. and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the election.The Trump campaign gave the committee 20,000 pages of records last week while Trump Jr. and Manafort produced 250 pages and 400 pages of records, respectively.The committee is one of three congressional panels investigating Russia-related matters, including the dossier and the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting held between Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney linked to Fusion GPS.In its request to Fusion, the Judiciary Committee asked for contracts that the firm signed for its work on the dossier.Fusion was initially hired to investigate Trump in Sept. 2015 by an unidentified Republican donor who opposed the real estate mogul. After Trump ascended to the GOP nomination, the donor dropped the project. But Fusion soon found a Democratic ally of Hillary Clinton s   also still unidentified   to continue the research. Fusion hired Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent, to conduct the investigation.Fusion and Steele s firm, Orbis Business Intelligence, have worked together on various projects since 2010.The committee also asked Fusion to produce contracts and communications regarding its work against the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law opposed by the Russian government.Who exactly was paying Fusion GPS for all of its projects against Trump? Read more: Daily CallerOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE DOSSIER:SHOCKING TESTIMONY Confirms Comey Used Fake Russian  Golden Showers  Dossier to Target Trump [Video]During congressional testimony, the CEO of Hermitage Capital was speaking about the  Foreign Agents Registration Act  (FARA). During the testimony the origin of the Fusion GPS  Russian Dossier  was discussed (please see our previous report on this below). The Hermitage Capital CEO revealed that the Russian government actually paid Fusion GPS to create the fake  Golden Shower  propaganda dossier on candidate Trump. Here s the kicker: That same dossier was used by the FBI in June/July 2016 to generate the FISA surveillance warrants against the Trump campaign.Yes, that means FBI Director Comey used the fake dossier  commissioned by Russia to attack Trump, as the framework to launch his FBI investigation into candidate Donald Trump and Russian collusion.Soooo why is Mueller still investigating President Trump?Entire video of Testimony Below:Graham s questioning begins at the 48:40 point:Foreign Agent Registration Requirements William Bowder, a Russian market investor, testifies at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on foreign agent registration requirements, as well as what he knows about Natalia Veslnitskaya, a Russian attorney who met with Donald Trump, Jr. in 2016. OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE DOSSIER:EXTRAORDINARY DETAILS EMERGE About How Senator John McCain Got  Dirty Dossier  On President Trump From Ex-Spy Where s The Media Outrage?Where was the media s outrage when a sitting United States senator, John McCain went on a wild goose chase, that led him overseas, in an effort to obtain what he believed was incriminating evidence that could be used to harm President Trump? How is it okay for Senator John McCain to actively seek dirt on a sitting president, but not okay for Donald Trump Jr. (who is NOT a government official) to meet with a Russian lawyer in an attempt to discover potential dirt on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton?Sen. John McCain commented on Tuesday about Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with the Russian lawyer. How serious do you think this particular shoe is?  Raju asked, referring to Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya after being promised dirt on Clinton that was reportedly part of a Russian government effort. I don t know. But it s certainly another shoe that s dropped that needs to be pursued and looked at,  McCain said.  TPMWatch RINO Senator John McCain express his concern overt the seriousness of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with the Russian lawyer about the lifting US sanctions on Russian adoption. It s curious that the reporter never asked McCain about his efforts to smear our president with a unsubstantiated dirty dossier from an ex-spy:Before we go any further into the messy details of John McCain s international dealings to find dirt on our sitting president, it s worth mentioning that as far as we know, no one was murdered as a result of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who entered the US without a visa under  extraordinary circumstances  thanks to the efforts of Barack Obama s DOJ. The same cannot be said about McCain s dealings with the  dirty dossier  on Trump. Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya is also said to have ties to Fusion GPS, the sketchy secretive Washington firm that commissioned the dubious intelligence dossier on Donald Trump.According to the Daily Caller   The Russian lawyer who offered Donald Trump Jr. damaging information about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reportedly has ties to the opposition research firm that commissioned the dossier on President Donald Trump.When the June 2016 meeting took place, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was in New York to defend Prevezon, a Russian holding firm accused of laundering money for corrupt Russian businessmen. Veselnitskaya had been working on the case for years with assistance from Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that compiled the Trump dossier.Fusion GPS denied any knowledge of, or role in, facilitating the meeting between Veselnitskaya and Trump Jr.According to The Sun: A FORMER KGB spy chief suspected of helping Brit spook Christopher Steele compile the Trump  dirty dossier  has been found dead in his car under mysterious circumstances.Oleg Erovinkin, described as a key source behind the widely discredited document, was found dead in the back of his car in Moscow on Boxing Day.Today, the Daily Mail reports: Sen. John McCain said he did  what any citizen would do  in turning over the dirty dossier, which contained unconfirmed secrets about the president-elect, over to the FBI.The Guardian charted the path of how the dossier came to be and how it was that McCain got his hands on the controversial documents.In turn, that firm outsourced the research to a  retired western European former counter-intelligence official, with a long history of dealing with the shadow world of Moscow s spooks and siloviki (securocrats),  explained the Guardian.Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal identified the ex-spy as Christopher Steele.The Guardian pointed out that just because a Democrat was willing to pay for the information that didn t mean that said Democrat was Hillary Clinton s campaign or the Democratic National Committee.Sometimes donors seek out this information in order to ensure they ve made a sound investment.***Yeah okay!***The contractor, who the Guardian didn t name, but the Wall Street Journal identified as Steele, reportedly found the information that he dug up to be concerning. He and another ex-British diplomat, Christopher Burrows, run their own company, Orbis Business Intelligence. If the allegations were real, their implications were overwhelming,  the Guardian wrote.On November 18, at the Halifax International Security Forum, McCain was introduced to a  former senior western diplomat  who had set eyes on the documents and knew who put them together, telling the Arizona Republican that the individual was  highly reliable. That man can now be named as Sir Andrew Wood, British ambassador to Moscow from 1995 to 2000.Wood told the Independent that he had met McCain, spoken to him about Trump, and about the potential for him to be compromised.In a carefully nuanced statement he said:  Yes I did meet Senator McCain and his aides at the conference. We spoke about the kind of activities the Russians can be engaged in. We also spoke about how Mr Trump may find himself in a position where there could be an attempt to blackmail him with Kompromat [a Russian term for compromising material] and claims that there were audio and video tapes in existence.   He added:  I would like to stress that I did not pass on any dossier to Senator McCain or anyone else and I did not see a dossier at the time. I do know Christopher Steele and in my view he is very professional and thorough in what he does. He did not however address whether he told McCain there was a dossier   and how to get it.Clearly, somebody did.From there, McCain dispatched a  trusted emissary  who flew across the Atlantic to meet the source of the documents at an airport that the Guardian did not name.The aide was instructed to look for a man with a copy of the Financial Times and that s how the individuals met, with the source taking McCain s emissary back to his house and giving the American a copy of the documents.Within 24 hours, the dossier was in Washington, though the contents of the file couldn t be verified without an investigation.  McCain, the Guardian said, was worried that his actions might be interpreted as revenge for some of the controversial comments Trump made about him   such as knocking the fact that the longtime senator had been a prisoner of war.However, McCain decided to hand over the documents to FBI Director James Comey on December 9. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI,  McCain said Wednesday in a statement about that matter. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue,  McCain said.For entire story: Daily MailRead more: CT",politics,"Aug 11, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
HOW NEWSWEEK ACCUSES Melania and Ivanka Of Sending Sexual Signals Will Even Make Trump-Haters Laugh,"The publication that just can t seem to get over Hillary s loss to President Trump has sunk to a new low. And yes, apparently that is possible Comparing our First Lady and our President s daughter to prostitutes?  Really? Perhaps no one told Newsweek that both of these beautiful, and yes, feminine women, happened to be successful businesswomen long before Donald Trump ever decided to run for President Newsweek attacked President Donald Trump s female relatives for wearing high heels in public in a piece published Thursday, saying it showed they were subservient to men. Melania, Ivanka, and Ivana Trump Wear High Heels, a Symbol of Everything That Is Beautiful and Horrifying About Them,  read the headline. The female consorts of the Leader of the Free World do not set foot in public without first molding their arches into the supranatural curve that Mattel toy designers once devised for Barbie s plastic feet,  the author complained.Newsweek argued that high heels are designed primarily to attract men, not for the comfort of the women wearing them. So to deconstruct why Trump women wear high heels: They are just buying into traditional binary views of male and female,  British psychologist Paul Morris opined. High heels thrust out the buttocks and arch the back into a natural mammalian courting,  an American anthropologist agreed.  Rats do it, sheep do it   lions do it, dogs do it. It is a naturally sexy posture that men immediately see as sexual readiness. [Heels] are a  come-hither  signal. When women wear high heels at work, they send sexual signals that should be avoided if they want to be taken seriously,  she said.Newsweek further noted that the first women to wear high heels were  Italian prostitutes in the 17th century  and that  the high heel was a staple of Victorian porn. Stiletto pumps are the ultimate test of a certain type of femininity. They signal the taut combination of power and weakness that conservative women must cultivate in order to survive among ideologues who are crafting our tax-free  Handmaid s Tale  future,  Newsweek concluded.

HILLARY’S PASTOR COMPARES Her Election Loss To Donald Trump To Death Of Jesus Christ [VIDEO],"A United Methodist minister, Rev. Bill Shillady is set to publish a book of daily Bible devotionals on August 15 2017. The book titled,  Strong for a Moment Like This  is said to be inspired by the verses regularly sent to Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was running for president.It will include 365 of the over 600 devotions as well as a forward by Clinton herself. The book s devotions are organized into 12 themes, such as forgiveness, doing good, courage, and women.A portion of the proceeds from the book will go to the United Methodist City Society in New York.   Praise The World RadioYEAH..Okay. A  portion of the proceeds  from the book will go to a church related organization, so where will the rest of the proceeds go? It s now been revealed that the pastor who s so enamored with Hillary Clinton, the woman who was seen frequently in church during the campaign, compared her election loss to President Trump to the death of Jesus Christ.WFB  Hillary Clinton s pastor compared her loss to Donald Trump to the death of Jesus Christ in a message he sent her the day after the November 2016 election. You, our nation, our world, is experiencing a black Friday,  Rev. Bill Shillady wrote to Clinton on Nov. 9, 2016, CNN reported.  Our hope is that Sunday is coming. But it might well be hell for a while. On Good Friday every year, Christians observe the crucifixion and death of Jesus, who they believe to be the Son of God. Two days later, they celebrate Easter Sunday, which marks the Resurrection of Jesus and the triumph over sin.One day after Clinton s stunning defeat at the hands of Trump, Shillady wrote that  life is filled with a lot of Fridays  and Good Friday  represented the day that everything fell apart. Today, you are experiencing a Friday. Your Friday is what happened in the last few weeks and last night in the tragic loss. But Sunday is coming!  Shillady wrote.Shillady went on to write about the suffering of Jesus for the world s sins and how his faith in God gave him  the grace and peace to submit to Friday. Friday is finished,  he wrote.  Sunday is coming. Death will be shattered. Hope will be restored. But first, we must live through the darkness and seeming hopelessness of Friday. Clinton, a Methodist, has reportedly discussed making her own spirituality more public, and Shillady has said she would make a  great pastor. Watch Pastor Shillady attempt to get the Democrat Party to pray at the DNC convention. Notice how he starts the prayer by saying,  Lord of many names . Even after many attempts to quiet the crowd and asking them to stop throwing balloons in front of his face while he prays, the mostly godless Democrats would have nothing to do with it Notice the tight shots the cameramen are forced to take because so few people in the audience are praying with the pastor.

WOW! FORMER NSA EXPERTS REPORT: Russians DID NOT Hack DNC Servers…It Was A LEAK…An INSIDE JOB By Someone With Access To DNC’s System,"It is now a year since the Democratic National Committee s mail system was compromised a year since events in the spring and early summer of 2016 were identified as remote hacks and, in short order, attributed to Russians acting in behalf of Donald Trump. A great edifice has been erected during this time.President Trump, members of his family, and numerous people around him stand accused of various corruptions and extensive collusion with Russians. Half a dozen simultaneous investigations proceed into these matters. Last week news broke that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had convened a grand jury, which issued its first subpoenas on August 3. Allegations of treason are common; prominent political figures and many media cultivate a case for impeachment.The president s ability to conduct foreign policy, notably but not only with regard to Russia, is now crippled. Forced into a corner and having no choice, Trump just signed legislation imposing severe new sanctions on Russia and European companies working with it on pipeline projects vital to Russia s energy sector. Striking this close to the core of another nation s economy is customarily considered an act of war, we must not forget. In retaliation, Moscow has announced that the United States must cut its embassy staff by roughly two-thirds. All sides agree that relations between the United States and Russia are now as fragile as they were during some of the Cold War s worst moments. To suggest that military conflict between two nuclear powers inches ever closer can no longer be dismissed as hyperbole.All this was set in motion when the DNC s mail server was first violated in the spring of 2016 and by subsequent assertions that Russians were behind that  hack  and another such operation, also described as a Russian hack, on July 5. These are the foundation stones of the edifice just outlined. The evolution of public discourse in the year since is worthy of scholarly study: Possibilities became allegations, and these became probabilities. Then the probabilities turned into certainties, and these evolved into what are now taken to be established truths. By my reckoning, it required a few days to a few weeks to advance from each of these stages to the next. This was accomplished via the indefensibly corrupt manipulations of language repeated incessantly in our leading media.There was no hack of the Democratic National Committee s system on July 5 last year not by the Russians, not by anyone else.Hard science now demonstrates it was a leak a download executed locally with a memory key or a similarly portable data-storage device.In short, it was an inside job by someone with access to the DNC s system. This casts serious doubt on the initial  hack,  as alleged, that led to the very consequential publication of a large store of documents on WikiLeaks last summer.Forensic investigations of documents made public two weeks prior to the July 5 leak by the person or entity known as Guccifer 2.0 show that they were fraudulent: Before Guccifer posted them they were adulterated by cutting and pasting them into a blank template that had Russian as its default language. Guccifer took responsibility on June 15 for an intrusion the DNC reported on June 14 and professed to be a WikiLeaks source claims essential to the official narrative implicating Russia in what was soon cast as an extensive hacking operation. To put the point simply, forensic science now devastates this narrative.This article is based on an examination of the documents these forensic experts and intelligence analysts have produced, notably the key papers written over the past several weeks, as well as detailed interviews with many of those conducting investigations and now drawing conclusions from them. Before proceeding into this material, several points bear noting.Qualified experts working independently of one another began to examine the DNC case immediately after the July 2016 events. Prominent among these is a group comprising former intelligence officers, almost all of whom previously occupied senior positions. Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), founded in 2003, now has 30 members, including a few associates with backgrounds in national-security fields other than intelligence. The chief researchers active on the DNC case are four: William Binney, formerly the NSA s technical director for world geopolitical and military analysis and designer of many agency programs now in use; Kirk Wiebe, formerly a senior analyst at the NSA s SIGINT Automation Research Center; Edward Loomis, formerly technical director in the NSA s Office of Signal Processing; and Ray McGovern, an intelligence analyst for nearly three decades and formerly chief of the CIA s Soviet Foreign Policy Branch. Most of these men have decades of experience in matters concerning Russian intelligence and the related technologies. This article reflects numerous interviews with all of them conducted in person, via Skype, or by telephone.The customary VIPS format is an open letter, typically addressed to the president. The group has written three such letters on the DNC incident, all of which were first published by Robert Parry at www.consortiumnews.com. Here is the latest, dated July 24; it blueprints the forensic work this article explores in detail. They have all argued that the hack theory is wrong and that a locally executed leak is the far more likely explanation. In a letter to Barack Obama dated January 17, three days before he left office, the group explained that the NSA s known programs are fully capable of capturing all electronic transfers of data.  We strongly suggest that you ask NSA for any evidence it may have indicating that the results of Russian hacking were given to WikiLeaks,  the letter said.  If NSA cannot produce such evidence and quickly this would probably mean it does not have any. Forensicator s first decisive findings, made public in the paper dated July 9, concerned the volume of the supposedly hacked material and what is called the transfer rate the time a remote hack would require. The metadata established several facts in this regard with granular precision: On the evening of July 5, 2016, 1,976 megabytes of data were downloaded from the DNC s server. The operation took 87 seconds. This yields a transfer rate of 22.7 megabytes per second.These statistics are matters of record and essential to disproving the hack theory. No Internet service provider, such as a hacker would have had to use in mid-2016, was capable of downloading data at this speed. Compounding this contradiction, Guccifer claimed to have run his hack from Romania, which, for numerous reasons technically called delivery overheads, would slow down the speed of a hack even further from maximum achievable speeds.In addition, there is the adulteration of the documents Guccifer 2.0 posted on June 15, when he made his first appearance. This came to light when researchers penetrated what Folden calls Guccifer s top layer of metadata and analyzed what was in the layers beneath. They found that the first five files Guccifer made public had each been run, via ordinary cut-and-paste, through a single template that effectively immersed them in what could plausibly be cast as Russian fingerprints. They were not: The Russian markings were artificially inserted prior to posting.  It s clear,  another forensics investigator self-identified as HET, wrote in a report on this question,  that metadata was deliberately altered and documents were deliberately pasted into a Russianified [W]ord document with Russian language settings and style headings. VIPS has assembled a chronology that imposes a persuasive logic on the complex succession of events just reviewed. It is this:On June 12 last year, Julian Assange announced that WikiLeaks had and would publish documents pertinent to Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign.On June 14, CrowdStrike, a cyber-security firm hired by the DNC, announced, without providing evidence, that it had found malware on DNC servers and had evidence that Russians were responsible for planting it.On June 15, Guccifer 2.0 first appeared, took responsibility for the  hack  reported on June 14 and claimed to be a WikiLeaks source. It then posted the adulterated documents just described.On July 5, Guccifer again claimed he had remotely hacked DNC servers, and the operation was instantly described as another intrusion attributable to Russia. Virtually no media questioned this account.It does not require too much thought to read into this sequence. With his June 12 announcement, Assange effectively put the DNC on notice that it had a little time, probably not much, to act preemptively against the imminent publication of damaging documents. Did the DNC quickly conjure Guccifer from thin air to create a cyber-saboteur whose fingers point to Russia? There is no evidence of this one way or the other, but emphatically it is legitimate to pose the question in the context of the VIPS chronology. WikiLeaks began publishing on July 22. By that time, the case alleging Russian interference in the 2016 elections process was taking firm root. In short order Assange would be written down as a  Russian agent. See Wikileaks founder Julian Assange s interview about the possibility of Seth Rich being the DNC leaker near bottom of the article. Behind the ICA lie other indefensible realities. The FBI has never examined the DNC s computer servers an omission that is beyond preposterous. It has instead relied on the reports produced by Crowdstrike, a firm that drips with conflicting interests well beyond the fact that it is in the DNC s employ. Dmitri Alperovitch, its co-founder and chief technology officer, is on the record as vigorously anti-Russian. He is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which suffers the same prejudice. Problems such as this are many. We continue to stand by our report,  CrowdStrike said, upon seeing the VIPS blueprint of the investigation. CrowdStrike argues that by July 5 all malware had been removed from the DNC s computers. But the presence or absence of malware by that time is entirely immaterial, because the event of July 5 is proven to have been a leak and not a hack. Given that malware has nothing to do with leaks, CrowdStrike s logic appears to be circular.Click HERE for the entire THE NATION article.  h/t Gateway Pundit Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has strongly hinted that the source for the DNC emails he released was Seth Rich. In this interview with Julian Assange, he seems to suggest on Dutch television program Nieuwsuur that Seth Rich was the source for the Wikileaks-exposed DNC emails and was murdered:",politics,"Aug 10, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

OKLAHOMA Supreme Court Rules Punishing Smokers With Cigarette Tax “Unconstitutional”…Lawmakers Forced To Fill SHOCKING Hole In State Budget,"OKLAHOMA CITY   The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled the cigarette tax passed late in the legislative session unconstitutional Thursday morning.The tax was expected to bring in more than $200 million of revenue for the state budget by tacking on an extra $1.50 per pack of cigarettes. The budget was planned and passed assuming the tax would hold.The tax was originally passed after the deadline for revenue raising bills, but Republican lawmakers tried to eke it through as a fee. A tax would have required a three-fourths majority to pass. Justices on Thursday ruled that, because the funds raised could be used for non-smoking related programs, the bill could not go through as a regulatory fee.The State now has a week to seek a rehearing. If it does not, the ruling is final.Gov. Mary Fallin issued a response to the Supreme Court s ruling:I am disappointed to hear the Supreme Court struck down the smoking cessation fee, but I certainly respect the justices  authority. I will be discussing with legislative leaders from both parties the need to address the $215 million shortfall this will create for the Department of Human Services, the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, the three agencies that received the bulk of the money that was to be generated by the cessation fee.These agencies and the people they serve cannot sustain the kind of cuts that will occur if we do not find a solution. My belief is we will have to come into special session to address this issue.House Minority Leader Scott Inman released the following statement on the ruling:Once again, Governor Fallin and Republican legislators have failed Oklahoma. My caucus and I sounded every alarm bell we could to stop this from happening, yet here we are, just as we warned.Today, I m urging Governor Fallin to call for a special session and for Republican leaders to come together with myself and Sen. Sparks and draft a truly bipartisan and constitutional budget plan that will help to restore, reinvest in, and rebuild Oklahoma.With our state agencies facing more budget cuts and with even more rulings waiting, the time is now to work out a budget agreement before a special session of the legislature. By coming together now and putting a plan in place, we can save precious time and taxpayer dollars to fix the mess that their failed leadership has put us in because of their failed policies to cut taxes for the wealthy and well-connected.This cigarette tax was just a Band-Aid put on their gaping wound of a budget hole. Schools are down to 4-day weeks, hospitals are closing down, and public safety is in a crisis, not because cigarettes are too cheap, but because Republican policies benefitting their donors have failed us.For entire story: News 9",politics,"Aug 10, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
HA! WHAT MAXINE WATERS Says We Must Give North Korea to Keep the Peace [Video],"Maxine Waters told a TMZ reporter that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should put threats aside and appease North Korea by giving them the  things that they re asking for . She responded as she was leaving an upscale steakhouse in Beverly Hills. She told the reporter that we can t afford to go to war. Pretty rich for a person who wants to spend unlimited amounts on everything else BUT what s MOST important to the U.S DEFENSE! I want us to be very careful, very alert to what is happening and to avoid war. I think we can do this with some diplomacy, but we have got to have Tillerson, who is our secretary of state, get those positions filled for deputy, for assistant, so that we can engage with North Korea. I think there s some things that they want from us, and we have to find out whether or not we can work with them on the things that they re asking for. This is exactly what Obama did for 8 years! It s exactly why we re in this position today!Read more: WFB",politics,"Aug 10, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
UPDATE ON 9/11 MEMORIAL Banned for “Triggering” College Snowflakes,"Great news! Southern Methodist University in Texas has reversed its decision to relocate an annual 9/11 memorial display made up of nearly 3,000 American flags to a less prominent part of campus after facing backlash from student groups.A huge thank you to The Young Americans for Freedom group! They had a hand in making this happen! They also were the ones who had set up the tribute honoring the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on SMU s Dallas Hall Lawn every year since 2010.But in July officials informed the group to move the display to Morrison-McGinnis Park because Dallas Hall Lawn is used for classes and a variety of events, said university spokesman Kent Best.SMU officials also had adopted a policy to ensure displays didn t include  harmful or triggering  messages, but they later removed the language from the then-policy as inappropriate. By that time, though, some student groups said the new policy was an attack on free speech. I don t believe it s the responsibility of the university to shield individuals from certain ideas that they might be offended by,  said Grant Wolf, the leader of the Young Americans for Freedom group, according to Dallas News. Wolf, along with other leaders from campus groups, sent a letter to university President R. Gerald Turner to express their frustration with the policy.  People absolutely have to have a right to their own opinions, but this does not come with a right to be shielded from opposing ideas, especially in an environment dedicated to the learning, sharing and developing of new ideas,  they wrote.They decried the relocation of the memorial. Moving the 9/11 memorial to an out of the way park is almost the same as not allowing it, said Heather Hall, president of the university s Turning Point USA chapter.  That s not free speech,  Hall said.  That s not American. That s definitely not what SMU stands for.   Read more:  Daily MailOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS BAN: The shocker about this is that students on both sides of the political spectrum want the 9/11 flags to be displayed where they ve always been displayed. The inability of college campuses to stand up to people who are perpetually offended is a sad statement on where we are in American tolerance these days. It s so ironic that the left wants you to march to their drum beat or else they will destroy you. Note to SMU: You had a good thing going with your student body coming together to memorialize 9/11 so let it continue!DALLAS, Tex.   In a time of extreme political divide, students both Republican and Democrat at one Texas college have found something they can agree on.For the past two years at Southern Methodist University, a campus group has planted thousands of American flags in front of Dallas Hall as a memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. That s simply contradictory to the very definition of free speech,  said Grant Wolf, the Young Americans for Freedom Chairman.But in July, SMU changed its policy, saying student groups can no longer have displays there.The lawn has historically hosted tributes and protests from students of all political affiliations. The leaders of two prominent student groups say the policy violates their right to free speech. They re basically cornering us into a segment of campus and saying you re not allowed to have a display here because it s triggering, harmful or offensive to students over there,  said Drew Wicker, the President of SMU College Republicans.SMU released a statement saying nearby Momac Park, where displays will be allowed, is larger than the lawn and is along one of the most prominent drives on campus.The university said it  respects the rights of all campus community members to express their opinions, as well as their right to be free from coercion or harassment.

"WATCH: CNN DOES SEGMENT From Bunker In Hawaii, Tells Viewers Hawaii’s Been Preparing For Nuclear Strike Since Trump Took Office…CNN’s Best Survival Tip: “FIND A CAVE”","CNN host Erin Burnett started out her segment on the threat of a nuclear attack by North Korea by explaining to her (very small) audience the danger Hawaii could face if nuclear North Korea, (the same nation Obama left ignored for 8 years), decided to strike Hawaii:  Guam of course, is not the only island within striking distance of North Korea. Another potential target within Kim Jong Un s range is Hawaii, which is where Sarah Sidner is live tonight. She s inside a bunker in Honolulu which houses the emergency center s state warning point.  Of course, there was no mention in Burnett s dramatic warning to her viewers of how Obama ignored the the very real nuclear threat that North Korea posed to the United States, or that President Trump was left to deal with a serious issue that President Bill Clinton bragged about handling while he was in office.Sidner went on to explain the very real threat that North Korea posed to the island of Hawaii and how Hawaiian officials there have been preparing for (here s the magic number)  at least seven months  (which, not surprisingly is about exactly the time that President Trump was inaugurated).Sidner then went on to explain that if a nuclear attack did take place on the island that not everyone would be affected. She explained to viewers in Hawaii, that if a nuclear missile was about to strike, they should get out of their cars and move to the inside of a building or their home, or find a cave. Find a cave?Watch the exchange here: Missile launch from North Korea to Hawaii is 20 mins. To create fear, @CNN reports from an underground bunker. https://t.co/Ylr5jbnk8k   A.D.

FEDERAL JUDGE Just Delivered Bad News to Hillary Clinton About the Missing Benghazi Emails,"Great news! A federal judge just ordered the State Department to make another attempt at locating Hillary Clinton s missing emails about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack. The interesting thing is that the judge is an Obama appointee who ruled with Judicial Watch. DIDN T DO ENOUGH .U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled Tuesday that the State Department did not do enough to  track down messages Clinton may have sent about the assault on the U.S. diplomatic compound on Sept. 11, 2012   an attack that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya,  Politico reported:In response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, State searched the roughly 30,000 messages Clinton turned over to her former agency at its request in December 2014 after officials searching for Benghazi-related records realized she had used a personal email account during her four-year tenure as secretary.State later searched tens of thousands of emails handed over to the agency by three former top aides to Clinton: Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan. Finally, State searched a collection of emails the FBI assembled when it was investigating Clinton s use of the private account and server.In all, State found 348 Benghazi-related messages or documents that were sent to or from Clinton in a period of nearly five months after the attack.Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, said the State Department s initial search was not good enough because it didn t search the email accounts of Clinton s top aides for relevant messages pertaining to Benghazi.Mehta, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, agreed with Judicial Watch in a 10-page ruling. To date, State has searched only data compilations originating from outside sources   Secretary Clinton, her former aides, and the FBI.   It has not, however, searched the one records system over which it has always had control and that is almost certain to contain some responsive records: the state.gov e-mail server,  Mehta wrote.",politics,"Aug 10, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
BRIAN WILLIAMS: It’s ‘Our Job’ to ‘Scare People To Death’ Over North Korea [Video],"MSNBC s Brian Williams spoke the truth on Tuesday night when he said that it is the media s job to  scare people to death  over North Korea. Wow! These are the first true words this serial liar has spoken in years!Williams commented that he thought Secretary of State Rex Tillerson s tone was different from President Trump s North Korea stance.Andrea Mitchell couldn t wait to jump in and criticize Trump:  There s pressure. This could have been a signal to Beijing as well;  Listen up, take this seriously.  It could have been President Trump sending signals in a number of directions. The next comment from Mitchell is hysterical because she uses two of the most anti-Trump people in Congress to say that even they criticized Trump s tone:  Senators Dianne Feinstein and John  Songbird  McCain wouldn t respond positively to pretty much anything that Trump said.Brian Williams then delivered his truth bomb:  Malcolm, our job tonight actually is to scare people to death on this subject so the talk isn t as free as it is about a preemptive or a surgical military strike. You know that part of the world. The population centers, Andrea and the General have talked about, South Korea, the Japanese, and so on and so on. What was Williams thinking? He let the cat out of the bag and actually told the truth. The lefty media is frothing at the mouth to make President Trump out to be clueless on strategy when in reality Trump is a master strategist! He s also surrounded himself with great military leaders!Would this crew of armchair quarterbacks want Trump to do what previous leaders did and kick the can down the road?

BREAKING NEWS: GENERAL MATTIS Issues Fiery Warning To N. Korea’s Kim Jong Un…STAND DOWN Or Face “End of Its Regime…Destruction of Its People”,"President Trump put North Korea s brutal dictator on notice yesterday, warning Kim Jong Un that North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States   they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen .President Trump sent this message on Twitter this morning. He was clearly letting the world know we are not planning to allow North Korea to threaten  the most powerful nation in the world : Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017The Korean People s Army responded to Trump s warning by saying the strike plan would be  put into practice in a multi-current and consecutive way any moment . They went on to say, The KPA strategic force is now carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam with medium-to-long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 in order to contain the US major military bases on Guam, including the Andersen Air Force base,  said the KPA, referring to a missile it first tested in May. US strategic bombers  threaten and blackmail [North Korea] through their frequent visits to the sky above South Korea , the KPA added.  It is a daydream for the US to think that its mainland is an invulnerable heavenly kingdom. Today, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis weighed in, as he issued a fiery warning to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, urging him to put an end to any  actions that would lead to the end  of the rogue regime  and the destruction of its people. The DPRK must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons,  Mattis said in a statement.  The DPRK should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people. He went on to say that President Trump since before taking office has been fully aware of the threat that North Korea s nuclear and missile programs pose. President Trump was informed of the growing threat last December and on taking office his first orders to me emphasized the readiness of our ballistic missile defense and nuclear deterrent forces,  Mattis continued.  While our State Department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means, it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth. The DPRK regime s actions will continue to be grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates.

WOW! ATLANTA GYM OWNER BANS COPS…Makes ‘No Apologies’ For Policy or Sign (Video),"It s one thing to have the media constantly painting police officers in a bad light on a near daily basis. But it s entirely another thing to have civilians discriminating against them on completely illegitimate grounds. This is exactly what happened this week when Jim Chambers, owner of the EAV Barbell Club in Atlanta, posted a sign on the front of his gym forbidding police officers.The message that the sign conveys alone is upsetting. But the expletives included make it an even more shocking and vulgar. While the sign is no longer posted on his gym s door, Chambers continue to stand by it. We ve had an explicitly stated  No Cop  policy since we opened, and we also don t open membership to active members of the military,  he said.As a lifelong political activist, Chamber says that his sign and policy serves as a political statement. He says groups who work out there are generally minorities who are uncomfortable with the presence of law enforcement agents. Chambers claimed that if any police officials had a warrant, they could do their job but that he is  not breaking the law. Chambers insists that they never have, and won t ever need the help of officers. He plans to put the  No Cop  sign back up without the foul language.When asked to comment, lawyers found the policy strange, but said because law enforcement officers are not a protected class under the law, only the courts can decide if EAV Barbell Club is violating any anti-discrimination laws. When asked to comment on the incident, the Atlanta Police Department stated,  Were we to respond to an emergency there, this sign would not stop us from lawfully doing our job.

WATCH: REMEMBER When President Clinton Took Credit for ENDING NUCLEAR THREATS from North Korea?,"Bill Clinton was falsely confident in his plan to end North Korea s nuclear threat with diplomacy. Over 20 years later, his efforts, along with those of every president succeeding him, have been futile.Every president since Clinton has allowed North Korea s nuclear ambitions to go unchecked. Perhaps now that North Korea allegedly has the capability of striking our mainland, America really needs is a president who is willing to stand up to North Korea s brutal dictator and let him know he s not playing with Barack Obama anymore.Will President Trump be the one to finally put an end to North Korea s threatening rhetoric by refusing to ignore Kim Jong Un s threats?North Korea now has an intercontinental ballistic missile that can range most of the continental U.S., and a new Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggests that North Korea has successfully miniaturized nuclear warheads for its missiles.In the early 1990s, Clinton faced a growing nuclear threat from North Korea, but he ultimately chose diplomacy and deals over the application of military force. I was determined to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear arsenal, even at the risk of war,  Clinton wrote in his memoirs. He decided to change course after receiving  a sobering estimate of the staggering losses both sides would suffer if war broke out. Watch Clinton brag about his great success with North Korea:NKorea Flashback: Bill Clinton on his deal with North Korea ""The world will be safer."" Whoops. pic.twitter.com/HDf86yqbEq  Mark Dice (@MarkDice) August 8, 2017Clinton chose the Agreed Framework, promising billions of dollars in aid for a North Korean nuclear freeze. This is a good deal for the United States,  he said at the time.  North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program. South Korea and our other allies will be better protected. The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons. The North Koreans negotiated in bad faith, however, offering false promises to convince the U.S. to unwittingly subsidize their nuclear program. The country began enriching nuclear material, and North Korea conducted its first nuclear test a little over a decade later. North Korea has since continued its steady march to becoming a fully-armed nuclear power. Evidence suggests that North Korea will achieve its nuclear weapons goals much sooner than analysts and experts previously expected.North Korea advanced its program throughout the Bush and Obama administrations, bringing the U.S. to the risky situation it now faces. North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,  Donald Trump declared to the White House press pool Tuesday.  They will be met with the fire and fury like the world has never seen. He has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said, they will be met with the fire and fury and, frankly, power the likes of which this world has never seen before. While the casualty count in a North Korean crisis might have been high in the 1990s, the cost of a conflict now that North Korea has nuclear weapons would be in the millions.

CANADA SENDS TROOPS TO U.S. BORDER To Deal With Illegals and Asylum Seekers Running From Trump’s New Policies On Immigration,"Immediately following President Trump s inauguration, liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took to Twitter to invite America s refugees and illegal immigrants to Canada. It was meant to be a jab at our new president after he promised to make it tougher for illegal aliens to cross our borders and for unvetted or poorly vetted refugees coming from terror hotbed nations to become guests of taxpaying Americans.It looks like Trudeau may have bitten off a little more than he could chew, as now he s forced to send troops to the northern US-Canada border in response to the overwhelming flow of asylum seekers into Canada.Canadian taxpayers will now be paying the price, as they ll be forced to house, feed, clothe, and provide free education to illegal aliens or asylum seekers coming from the US, who fear they won t be allowed to stay under the tougher guidelines the Trump administration is working to put in place. Canadian citizens must surely feel less safe with this huge increase in illegal border crossings, many of whom don t have proper documentation from their nation of origin.Illegal  refugees  have been flooding the 49th parallel from all over America to ILLEGALLY cross into Canada. According to Rebel Media s report, this is a well-organized effort with an American cab company and Greyhound as well as US and Canadian border agents working together to help loosely vetted illegal  fake refugees  cross the border from the US into Canada.Watch this incredible investigative report that was filmed by Rebel Media showing how the Canadian government has basically been complicit in a  fake refugee  human trafficking ring:  Canada has now been forced to send soldiers in to help keep up with the flow of illegals and asylum seekers through their porous northern borders with the U.S. But do they have any intention of sending any of them back to the US? Miami Herald Canada has sent about 100 soldiers to a remote spot on the Quebec-New York border where asylum seekers are crossing illegally.The Canadian military said in a statement Wednesday that the soldiers will help the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency at the site.They are preparing a place for tents that can hold almost 500 people. They will also install lighting and heating equipment.The military says the soldiers won t play a role in security and won t be helping with law enforcement.The migrants fear the U.S. is becoming less welcoming and have decided to try their luck seeking asylum in Canada. Officials estimate that 400 people crossed the border at the site on Sunday alone.Thousands of migrants are fleeing the United States for Canada via a remote back road in upstate New York.The Canadians arrest the migrants as soon as they step across the border. But the migrants prefer to take a chance by seeking asylum in Canada rather than risk being deported from the United States.Canadian police have set up a reception center on their side of the border. It includes tents where migrants are processed before they are turned over to the government agency that handles their applications for refuge.

HA-HA! RETIRED MARINE TROLLS LIBERAL NEW YORKERS…Says POTUS Is ‘Tough Love’ We Need [Video],"It s always a win-win when you can find a hobby you enjoy, especially when it allows you to get some exercise and enjoy the nice summer weather. This retired Marine hit the jackpot by finding a way to keep himself entertained and fit during retirement: trolling New York liberals by boat.Nearly every day, Dion Cini will row down the Hudson River while flying a  Trump 2020  flag to incite the frustration of New Yorkers, a group who overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton this past election.This retired Marine can t get enough of the responses he gets from people who spot him rowing around Manhattan. Sometimes you hear  I hope you get hit by a boat! I hope you drown!  he said.  From the top of their lungs as loud as they can. It can be from the edge of the river. It can be from cars driving by on the river. It can be from windows. I get it all the time and then I get it even on rooftop bars. Cini calls himself an  ultra-conservative  and thinks that Americans need a  wake-up call.   He said,  I call it tough love. (President) Trump is tough love. Cini recalled being told to leave Washington Square Park with his flag because it was  not conservative land  but he vowed that no one would stop him.Luckily, these angry New Yorkers haven t swayed Cini one bit. He s considering getting a bigger flag spanning twenty feet. And a bigger boat. Despite his retirement, it s inspiring to see that this Marine s devotion to patriotism hasn t wavered.Read more: BizPac Review",politics,"Aug 9, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Mid-interview (the 1:50 point) is when General McInerney drops the  Songbird  nickname Wow!You can tell their is no love lost between the General and McCain. Why did he call McCain songbird? Many believe that John  Songbird  McCain spilled his guts to get out of being tortured. There is evidence that McCain received  special  medical treatment from a Soviet physician and other  considerations  to avoid being tortured just so he could come home.No one disputes that McCain was a Vietnam POW, he spent 5  years in captivity in North Vietnam when he was shot down in his Skyhawk dive bomber on Oct. 26, 1967, and was taken prisoner with fractures in his right leg and both arms.Despite the notoriety he received upon his return he has been the subject of damning articles, and criticism by other veterans, and for good reason. McCain has a lot to hide, and has gone to great length to keep what happened in Vietnam a secret.He voted against a bill that was otherwise unanimously passed that would have released sealed records that would have revealed what happened in Vietnam, presumably because those records would have confirmed his dishonorable actions.

"MEDIA SPIN ALERT! FBI Does a “Predawn Raid” on Paul Manafort? Not Hillary, Rice, Lynch or Powers?","Why is the news just breaking that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort s home was raised by the FBI on JULY 26TH? Why would WaPo release this info now? While we have serious questions about the timing of this pseudo  Breaking  and  Developing  news, we have more serious questions on why none of the Obama criminals have also been treated to a raid by the FBI?  FBI agents raided the Virginia home of Paul Manafort, President Trump s former campaign chairman in late July, taking documents and other materials related to the *investigation into Russia s meddling in the 2016 election, The Washington Post reported.*AFTER ONE ENTIRE YEAR OF INVESTIGATIONS, THEY HAVE NOTHING!Armed with a search warrant, federal agents went to Manafort s Alexandria home during the predawn hours of July 26   one day after he met voluntarily with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.The search warrant seems to indicate that investigators may have had reason to believe Manafort could not be trusted to turn over all of the records requested in response to a grand jury subpoena, the Post reported, citing people familiar with the special counsel investigation.Special Counsel Robert Mueller has cranked up the intensity and legal pressure on Manafort on a series of unrelated investigations into various aspects of his personal and professional life.As a lobbyist and political consultant in the 1980s, Manafort worked with international clients including two dictators.Washington Post presumes to know why the FBI would raid Manafort s home but we still see nothing implicating him in any crime. He was Trump s campaign manager for a brief time and had his own past dealing with international clients. This shouldn t be a blip on the radar of the investigation connecting anything to President Trump!Washington Post reported: In many ways, Manafort is squarely in the crosshairs of the Russia-Trump collusion investigation: His brief tenure as the head of Trump s campaign happened as concerns about Russia s meddling in the 2016 election were heating up, he s got high-level connections to Russia in his own right, and he s got a whole host of scrutinized financial dealings that could make him a useful tool for investigators seeking cooperation.We d love to have input on this delayed reporting that has been the big story weeks after!

LEADER OF “Do-Nothing Senate” Mitch McConnell CAUGHT ON VIDEO Whining About President Trump’s “Excessive Expectations” Of Congress,"Speaking at a Rotary Club gathering in Kentucky on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vented about how President Donald Trump s lack of political experience has led to him setting  excessive expectations  for legislative priorities.McConnell, R-Ky., told the group in Florence that he found it  extremely irritating  that Congress has earned the reputation of not accomplishing anything. Part of the reason I think that the storyline is that we haven t done much is because, in part, the president and others have set these early timelines about things need to be done by a certain point,  said McConnell, a Republican and the state s senior senator.According to the latest Real Clear Politics poll, Congress currently has a 15% approval rating and a 73.3% disapproval rating. There is no mention anywhere in the poll that President Trump is somehow responsible for Congress  abysmal approval numbers: Trump, a political newcomer, as McConnell noted, has a habit of declaring progress on major priorities that do not necessarily reflect the reality of lawmaking.For example, as the House was in the midst of negotiations about its Obamacare replacement bill in February, Trump announced that Congress was in the  final stages  of its bill and said it would be ready for  submitting  in March. While the House bill was unveiled in March, that chamber didn t vote on it until May, and health care votes continued until the end of July.That sort of disconnect has led to Trump s expressing disappointment when bills   chief among them health care reform   fail to end up on his desk, even though, as with health care, the political reality indicated all along how difficult it was going to be to pass legislation. Our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before. And I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process,  McConnell told the group.  So part of the reason I think people feel we re underperforming is because too many artificial deadlines   unrelated to the reality of the complexity of legislating   may not have been fully understood.

BRILLIANT TRUMP ADVISER: “The Extreme Media” Has Gotten Donald Trump Wrong Since He Announced [Video],"What a treat! Laura Ingraham interviewed President Trump Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller tonight:Miller has been spot on from the beginning of his tenure as Senior Adviser to Trump He often  warmed up  the Trump rally crowds with incredibly uplifting speeches. He also gave a great speech about why not to vote for Hillary:Trump spokesperson Stephen Miller just hammers Hillary Clinton! You will love every minute of this!The guy is so dialed in on immigration and what needs to be done to reform it. One million people come into the U.S. yearly! 300K in the 70 s, 500K in the 80 s and now 1 million! NUTS!Ingraham pivots to speak about polls and the media Note that he calls the media the  extreme media LOL! Who doesn t love that new term?Ingraham discusses Trump s agenda and the populist movement. It s about trade, immigration, public safety to help ALL Americans.Uplifing everyone is the key!SOME BACKGROUND ON MILLER S RISE TO TRUMP S INNER CIRCLE:When Jeff Sessions first looked at Stephen Miller, he saw potential in the recent Duke University graduate.Miller, then in his early 20s, took up an offer from the conservative author David Horowitz to visit Capitol Hill to introduce him to members of Congress. Horowitz believed that Miller, who penned conservative columns at Duke and in Horowitz  Front Page Mag, would be a capable D.C. staffer. A meeting with Sessions was on the top of Miller s Washington wish list. What was supposed to be a 15-minute meeting became an hour-long meeting with the senator,  Stephen Boyd, Sessions  former communications director who eventually hired Miller.  Sen. Sessions immediately saw that Stephen Miller was an extraordinary young man who had a deep grasp of conservative politics. It wasn t only Sessions who saw something in Miller.When Donald Trump takes the oath of office on Friday, the 31-year-old Miller will be one of the president s closest confidants, serving as a senior White House advisor. That title, announced last month, comes after Miller worked as a senior policy advisor for the better part of a year on the Trump campaign. Trump also tasked Miller with writing his speech to the Republican National Convention, and initial reports indicated that Miller would be writing the inaugural address. The Trump camp is now saying that the president-elect wrote that one himself, although New York Magazine poked some holes in that claim.While Sessions did not have an opening for Miller at the time of that first meeting nearly 10 years ago, he told Boyd to put him on his radar. He came out and he said to me,  I want you to keep an eye on him and see if he can be a part of our team one day,'  Boyd recalled. After working as a press secretary to two House members, Miller was hired as a communications staffer on the Judiciary Committee, where Sessions was the top Republican. I remember setting up a staff and it was Friday afternoon, and I got the go-ahead to hire a press secretary just to work on Judiciary. [Sessions ] directions were very clear and he and I discussed it   that it was obvious this was a kid with a lot of talent,  Boyd said.Miller would move up the ranks from a Judiciary Committee staffer to press secretary for Sessions  office, eventually rising to communications director when Boyd departed to become chief of staff to Rep. Martha Roby, R-Montgomery, in 2012. Miller could not be reached for this story.On the surface, there didn t seem to be much in common between Sessions, who grew up near Selma, and Miller, who was raised in liberal Southern California.The turning point for Miller came after the Sept. 11 attacks, when he was disgusted with how his high school in Santa Monica ridiculed President George W. Bush and how the liberal-leaning faculty banned conservatives like Horowitz and talk show host Larry Elder from speaking at the school but allowed  leftists and a Communist  to address the student body, according to an interview he gave to the Los Angeles Times. During that dreadful time of national tragedy, anti-Americanism had spread all over the school like a rash,  Miller wrote in a 2003 essay,  How I Changed My Left Wing High School,  which Horowitz published.  The co-principal broadcasted his doubts about the morality of the air strikes against the Taliban to the entire school via the PA system. One teacher even dragged the American flag across the floor as we were sending off brave young men to risk their lives for it. It was then that I first took action, writing to prized radio personality Larry Elder. He invited me to discuss these issues on his program, which immediately drew the ire of the teachers, administrators, and even my fellow students. Their resistance only strengthened my resolve. Miller continued his conservative advocacy at Duke, when he gained attention for defending the white lacrosse players accused of raping a black stripper (the players were ultimately exonerated) at a time when public opinion was against them. His position led to appearances on cable news, further raising his profile. Three of our fellow students are being put on trial not because of evidence but because of a DA s incompetence and malice,  he wrote in the university s student paper.  Sadly, many in the community have shown that they are not fair minded but would rather hunt for witches than search for justice. Miller s writings were one of the main factors in Boyd hiring him. I focused on his material he had written for the other two members of the House. I was very impressed he had a column in college and he was a very good writer,  Boyd recalled.  I was impressed with his intellect, I was impressed with his grasp of politics. I was impressed with his ability to get the core of the matter and articulate it in a way [the public would] understand. Sessions  office later found out that Miller had an uncanny ability to channel the senator s when dealing with the press. Colleagues of Miller s and Sessions  told Politico that the two had a  mind meld,  a quality that Boyd also attested to. Miller has demonstrated an ability to capture the voice of his boss in a way that is very important and also exceeds the ability of most Capitol Hill staff,  Boyd said.That voice was mostly flexed on immigration, where explained Sessions  views to the public.When his boss was accused by pro-immigration groups of being a demagogue for his opposition to an unsuccessful 2010 bill to grant illegal immigrants amnesty for enrolling in college or enlisting in the military, Miller stuck to the issue instead of responding with another attack. The DREAM Act is a proposal for mass amnesty that would even include those who have committed serious criminal offenses,  he told AL.com in November 2010.  It would add millions of newly authorized workers at a time when Americans are struggling with high unemployment and recession. Besides being a conduit between the senator and the media, Miller also played a role on policy matters; he was instrumental in helping Sessions derail the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill in 2014 that would have given illegals a pathway to citizenship. Miller helped put together a briefing book for Republicans filled with talking points and data to bolster their case. We had been working on the ideas in it for months, and Stephen put it in the handbook in a very quick time in a very cogent fashion,  Sessions told Politico.  It was very timely and it impacted the outcome of the vote. Boyd said Miller s involvement on policy was unusual for a communications staffer. It is rare, although in his case I think it speaks to his grasp on the issues and his understanding as they impact the average man and woman,  Boyd said.  There s no doubt that there was a great trust between Sen. Sessions toward Stephen Miller and they made a great team. Miller s having switched to a high-level position on Trump s team at a relatively young age does not come as a shock to Boyd, who said his former colleague has adeptly articulated Trump s views. I think personally that Miller was one of the first people to really understand the deep frustration that the American working class is feeling, their concerns with open borders and trade policies that hurt them more than they help, and also brought an ability to channel that energy toward president-elect Trump,  he said.Steve Bannon, former Breitbart News CEO and Trump s campaign manager who will join Miller in the White House as chief advisor to the president, said Sessions  work in the Senate   with Miller s input   paved the way for Trump s candidacy. Whether the issue was trade or immigration or radical Islam, for many years before Donald Trump came on the scene, Sen. Sessions was the leader of the movement and Stephen was his right-hand man,  Bannon told Politico in their June profile of Miller.What started out as the potential of a recent college graduate has turned into high expectations for Miller.

FLASHBACK: TRUMP PLANS STRATEGY Against North Korea In ’99 Interview [Video],"There is no debating the fact that tensions between the United States and North Korea have reached a boiling point. But what s still being continuously debated is how to handle these tensions.President Trump threatened to use  fire and fury  against North Korea after it was revealed that North Korea successfully created a miniaturized nuclear weapon designed to fit inside its missiles. In an interview with NBC s Tim Russert in 1999, then businessman Donald Trump voiced his support for a pre-emptive military strike against North Korea.Trump told Russert that if he was President, a Trump administration would  negotiate like crazy  to  get the best deal possible.  If a deal was not possible, Trump said he would order a pre-emptive strike. He went on to successfully predict that that they re [North Korea] are going to have those weapons pointed all over the world and specifically at the United States.  He goes further by saying that it only does the U.S. minimal good to discuss the economy and Social Security without addressing the biggest problem: nuclear proliferation. He also calls out previous politicians   including Jimmy Carter   for not facing this situation head on and negotiating properly.Following President Trump s warning North Korea over further provocations, the Hermit Kingdom has announced it is considering striking Guam. The North Korean military warned it may carry out a preemptive operation once the US shows signs of provocation , and that it is seriously considering a strategy to strike Guam with mid-to-long range missiles. As Trump moves forward, this interview serves as evidence that his strategy will hold up against North Korea.Read more: The Gateway Pundit",politics,"Aug 8, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Daily CallerTrump didn t stop with his string of attacks on the con-man senator, Richard Blumenthal. He took to Twitter again yesterday to suggest Senator Blumenthal talk a  nice long vacation in Vietnam, where he lied about his service, so he can at least say he was there. I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam, where he lied about his service, so he can at least say he was there  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017Blumenthal criticized the Trump administration s decision to triple the number of leak investigations pursued by the Department of Justice, arguing in the CNN segment that the plan represented an attempt to  weaponize  leak probes.Trump s comments allude to a 2010 New York Times report which found that Blumenthal falsely claimed he had served in Vietnam during the U.S. occupation. In truth, Blumenthal served in the U.S. Marine Corps reserve, but he never left the U.S. in the course of service. The senator later explained that he  misspoke. In case anyone was thinking (or hoping) President Trump would discontinue using Twitter as a way to keep a direct line of communication open with Americans, it s not gonna happen. Most of his supporters have become used to his bombastic style and appreciate the way in which he has chosen to connect with Americans in a more direct fashion.Just before President Trump destroyed the con-artist senator from Connecticut, he sent this tweet, where, after he shared some of his most significant accomplishments to date, he made it perfectly clear to his followers that he  Will never change! :  Supreme Court pick, economic enthusiasm, deregulation & so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together.

MI SCHOOL SENDS Welcome Back Packet Warning Kids Against Wearing U.S. Flag To School,"ROSEVILLE, Mich.   Parents are raging after a Detroit area school district sent a packet to parents that lists the U.S. flag among items banned by the school dress code. A student s dress should not interfere with the learning environment,  Roseville Community School officials wrote.  The following are prohibited: The items include the typical slippers and sagging pants, spaghetti straps and bare midriff tops, but between  Hats or head gear  and  Low cut shirts,  the letter lists  U.S. Flag. Parents and others raged on Facebook Thursday. Here is a picture of the post by Facebook user and parent  Heather Marie :It didn t take long for school officials to clarify the  error. An informational packet was mailed out this week with an error,  according to a statement on the Roseville Community Schools website.  We apologize for the incorrect statement that was in reference to the US Flag. The statement that was published should have specified that the flag should not be worn in a demeaning manner.  EAG NewsHere s a screen shot of the  corrected  packet:The fact that Roseville Schools removed  U.S.  before the word  flag  from their corrected list of  Prohibited Apparel  is especially interesting. In fact, the words they replaced  U.S. flag  are so different, that many of the parents in Roseville think the school is just trying to cover their tracks.Here are a few of the comments under Heather Marie s post that got over 4K shares: After 1.8k plus shares, Fox 2 news, and channel 4 news the school has said that it was  a misprint  and they are able to wear the flag as long as it is not in a demeaning way. They said they took a short cut in printing the books, in all reality they were more than likely thinking no one was even going to read it. Anyways, I m happy that it has been fixed. Now I don t have to go and get all flag shirts and iron flags on the inside of them so they still show when they make them flip the shirt inside out for my 3 kiddos LMAO.   When letters get made and sent home before they make copies they proofread them several times. This is no accident they just realized that they have offended a lot of people and now want to try to fix their mistakes. You go mama bear! I agree parents should come together on that after all we are in the USA and it is our country I totally disagree with that . as a Roseville parent and a parent in the USA I proudly support the flag.

BURN! SEBASTIAN GORKA HUMILIATES MSNBC On Use of ‘Radical Islamic Terrorism’ [Video],"It s probably not the wisest decision to argue with Dr. Sebastian Gorka about the use of the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism    especially if you have absolutely no idea what you re talking about in the first place.Dr. Sebastian Gorka defended the Trump administration s use of the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism  in an appearance on MSNBC Tuesday. We will call it  radical Islamic terrorism. We will target the ideology, and we will call them out for being evil,  Gorka stated. MSNBC s Ali Velshi and Stephanie Ruhle then tried to criticize Gorka s use of the phrase.Velshi asked Gorka how it would help stop terror attacks if the White House called the problem  radical Islamic terrorism. Gorka then engaged a clever metaphor to help them understand. Gorka argued,  If you, God forbid, caught cancer, and the hospital was forbidden from calling it cancer and said,  You have the flu. Go home and hydrate and take some aspirins, would you actually have the right treatment?.' Ruhle responded, smugly, that there s still no cure for cancer and that it doesn t matter what you call it if it will still kill you.Velshi then accused Gorka of not having a good answer. Gorka fired back by saying that if you misdiagnose anything, whether it s a serious disease or a serious international geopolitical threat, you will never solve it. The White House Adviser then criticized the Obama administration for blaming this geopolitical issue on economic conditions and societal disenfranchisement It is about people having an ideology that is evil, and it has to be destroyed.

WHY THE HUGE 1.1 MILLION DROP in Food Stamp Enrollment? [VIDEO],"OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DROPPED OFF OF THE FOOD STAMP LISTS GREAT NEWS!The surprising group that dropped off is illegals Yes, some illegals ARE eligible for food stamps! The USDA has this SNAP FOR NON-CITIZEN GUIDANCEWith the states of Georgia and Alabama leading the way, more than 1.1 million Americans dropped off the food stamp rolls since President Trump took office in January 2017, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) statistics on food stamp enrollment. Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) dropped to 41,496,255 in May 2017, the most recent data available from the USDA, from 42,691,363 in January 2017 when Trump took office.According to the latest data, SNAP enrollment during the first few months of Trump s presidency decreased by 2.79 percent.Food stamp participation on average in 2017 has dropped to its lowest level since 2010, and the latest numbers show that this trend is continuing.Trump proposed cuts to SNAP in his 2018 budget proposal, suggesting that states match up to 20 percent of federal money allotted for the food stamp program and expand work requirements for able-bodied adults receiving food stamps.Trump s crackdown on illegal immigration has also prompted many immigrants, both legal and illegal, to cancel their food stamps over concerns that they might be denied citizenship or deported.Federal lawmakers are also working on legislation that would seek to expand food stamp work requirements and put time limits on how long those enrolled in the food stamp program can receive benefits.Read more: Breitbart News",politics,"Aug 8, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

This village idiot connects Mosque burnings to Trump when anyone with half a brain knows the Muslims are vandalizing their own Mosques (see below)! They don t even know who burned the Minnesota Mosque!The blame has been put on President Trump but could it be that the Muslims set fire to these Mosques to produce a backlash? some of the arson cases have not been solved so why is Buzzfeed blaming the attacks on anti-Muslim arsonists?BUZZFEED MAKES FALSE CLAIMS:In the past seven weeks, four mosques across the country have caught fire, according to BuzzFeed News. Three of those fires have been ruled arson, authorities stated.On Jan. 7, the Islamic Center of Lake Travis in Austin, which had been under construction, caught on fire. A week later, on Jan. 14, the Islamic Center of Eastside in Bellevue, Washington, burned.Two weeks after that, on Jan. 28, several hours after President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, a fire destroyed the Islamic Center of Victoria in Texas.According to BuzzFeed News, the Daarus Salaam Mosque near Tampa, Florida, caught on fire this past Friday, marking the fourth mosque in to go up in flames in fewer than two months.

UNIV Of GA PROFESSOR Allows Students To CHOOSE THEIR OWN GRADES To Help Alleviate Stress,"A University of Georgia professor has adopted a  stress reduction policy  that will allow students to select their own grades if they  feel unduly stressed  by the ones they earned.According to online course syllabi for two of Dr. Richard Watson s fall business courses, he has introduced the policy because  emotional reactions to stressful situations can have profound consequences for all involved. As such, if students feel  unduly stressed by a grade for any assessable material or the overall course,  they can  email the instructor indicating what grade [they] think is appropriate, and it will be so changed  with  no explanation  being required. If in a group meeting, you feel stressed by your group s dynamics, you should leave the meeting immediately and need offer no explanation to the group members,  the policy adds, saying such students can  discontinue all further group work  with their remaining grade being  based totally on non-group work. Similarly, when it comes to  tests and exams  for Watson s  Data Management  and  Energy Informatics  courses, all will be  open book and open notes  and  designed to assess low level mastery of the course material  (the  Stress Reduction  section has been removed from both syllabi, but an archived version of the  Data Management  syllabus has been provided here).Finally, for in-class presentations, Watson will allow  only positive comments  to be made, while  comments designed to improve future presentations will be communicated by email.   For entire story: Campus ReformPerhaps someone should give the good professor a ticket to Afghanistan so he can spend time with some of our young, brave, college-age troops who don t get to chose their next assignment because it might be  too stressful  for them.Parents of these students need to start speaking up.

U.S. SPY SATELLITES Detect North Korea Transferring Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles to Patrol Boat,"While the main stream media continues to chase anything and everything to try and take down President Trump, we have a serious problem with North Korea that s heating up. The madman in charge of North Korea continues to stand firm even after sanctions were unanimously voted for at the UN. North Korea s missile tests will continue in spite of any move the U.S. makes to stop them Dr. Sebastian Gorka spoke with Sean Hannity regarding this development:The latest from FOX NewsDespite the United States  insistence that North Korea halt its missile tests, U.S. spy agencies detected the rogue communist regime loading two anti-ship cruise missiles on a patrol boat on the country s east coast just days ago.It s the first time these missiles have been deployed on this type of platform since 2014.It also points to more evidence that North Korea isn t listening to the diplomatic threats from the West. The best signal that North Korea could give us that they re prepared to talk would be to stop these missile launches,  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in the Philippines Monday.TILLERSON TO NOKO:  WE ARE NOT YOUR ENEMY TILLERSON S FOUR NO S: The United States does not seek  regime change,  the collapse of the regime,  an accelerated reunification of the peninsula or  an excuse to send the U.S. military into North Korea.North Korea loaded two Stormpetrel anti-ship cruise missiles on a Wonsan guided-missile patrol boat at Toejo Dong on North Korea s east coast. North Korea is not showing any evidence it plans to halt its missile tests,  said one official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive information.  It s a trend that does not bode well for hopes of de-escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula.

"WHILE DEMOCRATS Were Focused On Russia and P*ssy Hats, President Trump Quietly Accomplished Something So Awesome, It Will Leave Conservatives Cheering","The Democrats and their allies in the media would like you to believe that President Trump has been so distracted by their allegations and by the untold number of  unnamed sources  they ve quoted in their fabricated stories about him, that he s been virtually paralyzed by the negative press. They d like you to believe he s been so distracted by their antics, that he s been unable to accomplish any of his campaign promises That is 180 degrees from the truth. And that s the case across a wide range of issues, but none is so important   or of long-lasting consequence   as the judiciary.So here s an update on Trump s judicial nominations, as compared to Obama, Bush 2, Clinton, and Reagan. Like Trump, each replaced a President of the other party and each came into office with a Senate of their own party. G.W. Bush made 15 of those 44 nominations on August 2, 2001.1. President Trump has made more judicial nominations at this point than Obama, Clinton, and Reagan combined, all of them outstanding.2. Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has held hearings for more judicial nominees at this point than the Committee held under any of these previous Presidents.3. Despite having to take a cloture vote on every nominee, the Senate has confirmed more judges so far than under these previous Presidents.That s just an incredible record, particularly with regard to the extremely high quality of these picks. And we should be very grateful: it was not at all obvious, even to many of the most ardent Trump supporters, that Donald Trump would be good on judges, given that this is far from his obvious area either of expertise or interest.But in fact, at the rate he s going at present, Donald Trump may well prove to be the best President in American history on judges. And of all the things he might achieve, that is orders of magnitude more important than all the rest.  Rod D.

WATCH: RACIST CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS Won’t Rule Out An “All-Black Political Party”…Black People Aren’t “Strong Enough” Yet To Form Their Own Party,"Close your eyes and picture Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) telling a white radio host that he wouldn t rule out an  all-white  party. Now picture his political career and his personal life being destroyed. Will the same thing happen to Maxine Waters, the woman the Democrat Party is talking about electing as their next leader?Waters joined  The Breakfast Club  radio show on Monday morning and was asked if it was time for black people to form their own political party. No, not at this point,  Waters said.  You have to show that you re willing and you re able to put the numbers together and exercise your influence. We still are not voting our influence yet,  she continued.  What we should do is organize our power, exercise our power, particularly in the Democratic Party because that s where most of us are. Waters then suggested that when black people are  strong enough  they may branch out into their own party.

FACTORY WORKER RIPS INTO Speaker Paul Ryan on the “Do Nothing” Congress [Video],"We love this guy! Factory worker Keith Ketzler: For eight horrible years I heard,  We don t have control of the House. We don t have control of the senate. We don t have the presidency and when we get in we got a plan and we re going to change stuff.  Well I tell you what, you re in there now and all I see is infighting. It s very dysfunctional.This guy just said whatever American would like to say to Paul Ryan! Notice how the answer was just more rhetoric blah, blah, blah All talk and NO ACTION!Paul Ryan is in the back pocket of the Chamber of Commerce and other special interest groups. He s talking out of both sides of his mouth. He needs to go!PAUL RYAN AUDIO GIVES US INSIGHT INTO HOW HE REALLY FEELS ABOUT TRUMP:AUDIO RELEASED: Paul Ryan Caught On Tape:  I am not going to defend Donald Trump not now, not in the future We all know Paul Ryan was no fan of President Donald Trump while he was running for office. Sadly, unlike the Democrats who held their noses and went  all in  for Hillary, our Republican Speaker of the House went out of his way to NOT support Trump during his highly contentious campaign. Now that a new audio tape has emerged, proving that Ryan went out of his way to make sure his colleagues in the House understood that he would  never  support Trump, this leaves Ryan looking pretty foolish considering the public support Trump has offered Ryan and his increasingly unpopular  Obamacare Lite  proposal.On a never-before-released private October conference call with House Republican members, House Speaker Paul Ryan told his members in the U.S. House of Representatives he was abandoning then-GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump forever and would never defend him ever again. In the Oct. 10, 2016 call, from right after the Access Hollywood tape of Trump was leaked in the weeks leading up to the election, Ryan does not specify that he will never defend Trump on just the Access Hollywood tape he says clearly he is done with Trump altogether. I am not going to defend Donald Trump not now, not in the future,  Ryan says in the audio, obtained by Breitbart News and published here for the first time ever.Now, Ryan still the Speaker has pushed now President Donald Trump to believe his healthcare legislation the American Health Care Act would repeal and replace Obamacare when it does not repeal Obamacare. Ryan has also, according to Trump ally Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), misled President Trump into believing that Ryan s bill can pass Congress. Paul and others believe the bill is dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate since a number of GOP senators have come out against it, and there are serious questions about whether it can pass the House. This is the first major initiative that Trump has worked on with Ryan and the fact it is going so poorly calls into question whether Speaker Ryan, the GOP s failed 2012 vice presidential nominee who barely supported Trump at all in 2016, really understands how Trump won and how to win in general.The October conference call apparently was intended only for House Republican members. It s unclear which or how many House Republicans took part in the call, whether the participants knew it was being recorded, who made the recording, or whether a recording exists of the entire call. The remarks on the portion provided to Breitbart News certainly sound like they were coming from Speaker Ryan, who seemed to be abandoning his party s presidential nominee altogether just weeks before the election. He says not only will he not defend the Access Hollywood comments, but he will not campaign with Trump at all between this call on Oct. 10, 2016, and the general election for the presidency on Nov. 8 and that Ryan would not defend Trump on anything generally.

VA Governor Switched Parties At Trump Rally Last Week","Civil political discourse took a beating in West Virginia this weekend when a Democratic senator profanely proclaimed that he was going to vote the way he wanted and didn t  give a s t  if it cost him his seat.

STUNNING DISREGARD FOR LAW: 11 CA Counties Have More Registered Voters Than Voting Age Citizens…Look Who They Voted For In Last Election,"But..b but it isn t fair to ask for voter ID says the party that dominates the states that refuse to cooperate with Trump s election commission. The more corruption that s exposed through post-election voting investigations, the more we begin to understand why so many Democrat pundits and liberal media outlets were so sure Hillary had the election in the bag..Eleven counties in California have more registered voters than voting age adults in the county.Judicial Watch announced it sent a notice-of-violation letter to the state of California and 11 of its counties threatening to sue in federal court if it does not clean its voter registration lists as mandated by the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). Both the NVRA and the federal Help America Vote Act require states to take reasonable steps to maintain accurate voting rolls. The August 1 letter was sent on behalf of several Judicial Watch California supporters and the Election Integrity Project California, Inc.In the letter, Judicial Watch noted that public records obtained on the Election Assistance Commission s 2016 Election Administration Voting Survey and through verbal accounts from various county agencies show 11 California counties have more registered voters than voting-age citizens: Imperial (102%), Lassen (102%), Los Angeles (112%), Monterey (104%), San Diego (138%), San Francisco (114%), San Mateo (111%), Santa Cruz (109%), Solano (111%), Stanislaus (102%), and Yolo (110%).In the letter, Judicial Watch noted that Los Angeles County officials  informed us that the total number of registered voters now stands at a number that is a whopping 144% of the total number of resident citizens of voting age. Remember when the Huffington Post denied voter fraud was an actual thing in America, while calling Hillary Clinton, (the candidate who clearly benefitted from illegal voting practices) the  legitimate President-Elect? Under Section 8 of the NVRA, states are required to make a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from official lists due to  the death of the registrant  or  a change in the residence of the registrant,  and requires states to ensure noncitizens are not registered to vote.There is  strong circumstantial evidence that California municipalities are not conducting reasonable voter registration list maintenance as mandated under the NVRA,  Judicial Watch wrote in the notice letter sent to California Secretary of State Alex Padilla.

UPDATE: FATHER HELPS STUDENTS After Lefties Censored Photos with Pro-Trump Slogans,"You may remember the story of a New Jersey high school that came under fire after President Trump s campaign logo and slogan were digitally removed from two students  yearbook photos and another student s quote from the president was also excluded.The students complained about Wall Township High School s censorship, which led to an outpouring of support   including from the president himself   and the eventual suspension of the school s yearbook club adviser.200 copies of the yearbook were reissued with the photos and quote intact, at a cost of $10,000.Now, it s been revealed that the father of one of the students footed a majority of the bill for the reprint.Joseph Berardo, father of Grant Berardo, donated $5,279 out of his own pocket.Another $3,000 was given by Lors Photography, which was hired by the school district to take yearbook photos.Jostens, the yearbook publisher, will issue a credit to the district for any further costs.Berardo said he put money toward the reprint because he felt it was  the right thing to do. I didn t want there to be some other program that didn t get funded because of this,  he said.  They responded appropriately and corrected it. Supporting the kids of Wall Township seemed like the right thing to do.

CITY TO DECIDE: Should They Allow Illegals to Vote in Local Elections?,"The slippery slope continues College Park is just the latest city in Maryland to propose that illegals be given the right to vote in local elections. If you re NOT outraged by this, we d love to know why not. Once you start allowing non-citizens to decide on anything within your city, doesn t this preclude the legal citizens from receiving their lawful voting rights?This is not unconstitutional but it is unAmerican!College Park, Md. is weighing whether or not to allow illegals  to vote in local elections.Officials in College Park, which is home to the University of Maryland s main campus, have yet to make their final decision, the Baltimore Sun reports.Opponents say immigrants   even those in the country legally, such as green-card holders   should not be able to have a say in the direction of the community until they complete the process of becoming a citizen.The measure s sponsor, City Councilwoman Christine Nagle, said it would be good for noncitizens living in the city to make decisions regarding local services. These are folks who have a significant stake in our community, and who rely on the facilities in our city,  Nagle said.  To me, it just made sense. College Park would not be the only city in the state to allow noncitizens to vote: Takoma Park, Md. has allowed noncitizens to vote since 1991, and two towns in Montgomery County have done the same. Other Maryland towns are considering and adopting the same measure.Via: Baltimore Sun",politics,"Aug 7, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

That has not appeased the activists, who are tentatively planning a Sept. 11 protest at Correa s district office. It s a bad example for our congressman,  said Orange resident Mike McGertrick, an activist with We the People Rising.  He shouldn t have anything religious in his office.

"ERIC BOLLING Accuser Is Serial Sexual Harassment Accuser, P*ssy-Hat Wearing, Trump-Hating, Left-Wing Activist Professor","Yesterday, Fox News announced that they were suspending Eric Bolling after accusations that the popular host sent lewd photos to at least three female coworkers   two at Fox Business and one at Fox News.Many believe the accusations against Eric Bolling are just more lies in a series of false sexual misconduct allegations levied against Fox News  top personalities, like Bill O Reilly and the now deceased Roger Ailes. The woman who attempted to smear Fox News host Sean Hannity quickly dropped her accusations when Hannity took off the gloves announced he would fight accuser Debbie Schulssel with  some of the finest and toughest lawyers in the country  after she accused the Fox News host of sexually propositioning her as allegations of sexual harassment continue to roil the network.Philly.com   Suspended Fox News host Eric Bolling s first public accuser is a major left-wing activist who held a protest sign at President Trump s inauguration accusing the president of being a rapist.Caroline Heldman, an Occidental College professor who appeared on Fox News, reportedly  filed a sexual harassment complaint just hours before Fox News announced O Reilly s departure,  according to People magazine.Now, she is back to accuse Eric Bolling, a major Trump supporter at the network. Here is Philly.com s report:Hours after Fox News announced it was suspending Bolling, Caroline Heldman, a politics professor at Occidental College and frequent guest on the network from 2008 to 2011, claimed the Fox News host made an unspecified number of unsolicited sexual advances to her. [Bolling] said he wanted to fly me out to New York for in-studio hits and to have  fun.  He asked me to have meals with him on several occasions, but I found excuses not to go,  Heldman wrote in a lengthy Facebook post.  Once, he took me up to his office in New York, showed me his baseball jerseys, and in the brief time I was there, let me know that his office was his favorite place to have sex. Bolling s team is denying the accusations. Heldman s social media profiles show her to be a staunch left-wing feminist activist.

MAXINE WATERS Gleefully Reveals Plan to Destroy Trump in Disturbing Interview [Video],"Rep. Maxine Waters said today that if Robert Mueller  does his job  and is able to prove collusion between President Donald Trump s campaign and the Russians, then  we ve got him. In an interview with MSNBC host and self-professed Waters fan Joy Reid, Waters reiterated that Democrats needed to work to remove Trump from office. Reid asked Waters if she had a sense that more Republicans in Congress were willing to  stand up  to Trump.Waters said she felt some Republicans did not know how to handle the situation or were simply waiting for the president to  implode. Many of them are not comfortable, and I believe that if Mueller does his job, if he s able to connect the dots, if he s able to show collusion, then we ve got him,  she said.  They will move away from him. Waters, a darling of progressives due to her constant calls for Trump s impeachment, has previously likened Mueller s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election to a contest of sorts. In an appearance Friday on MSNBC, she said Mueller is  going to win. Trump has consistently stated the Mueller probe is a  witch hunt  and pointed to the partisanship of the investigators on his team, although other Republicans have said Mueller s reputation is unquestioned.On  The View  last week, Waters said she welcomed the leaks coming from Trump s White House and was  so glad they re telling us what s going on.

"WATCH: KELLYANNE CONWAY Gives Dreaded Answer To Liberal Hack, “This Week” Host George Stephanopoulos’ Question About Trump’s Plans To Run In 2020","ABC host George Stephanopoulos sat down with Kellyanne Conway for an interview this morning on  This Week . Stephanopoulos started out the interview by mentioning the new jobs report and the explosion of the stock market under President Trump. He barely took a breath before he jumped directly to a poll that showed despite all of his many accomplishments, that Trump isn t very popular. Kellyanne Conway was quick to point out, that although Trump s poll numbers aren t as strong as she d like them to be, he s keeping his head down and focusing on his agenda. In other words, President Trump is laser focused on honoring the campaign promises he made to American people who elected him. What a novel idea One can only imagine the disappointment Stephanopoulos must have felt when he got the dreaded answer from Conway to his question about President Trump s plans to run in 2020. After all, who could forget when George Stephanopoulos  wife promised (but of course, didn t follow through) that she would move her family to another country if President Trump won the election?Watch:Conway responded to Stephanopoulos  question about Trump running in 2020:  The president says privately and publicly, often, George that he ll be president for seven and a half more years, so he plans on being a two-term president. Last week, the New York Times article attempted to convince their readers that the Republican Party is divided and fractured and that many of the members of the party were attempting to convince Vice President Mike Pence to run for president in 2020.Pence was furious at the accusation that he was somehow involved in a potential coup against President Trump. So much for the wishful thinking of not very credible and very biased New York Times.And finally, it wouldn t be an interview with the mainstream media if they didn t ask about Trump s phony Russia connection. Kellyanne Conway didn t disappoint with her answer as she blasted Stephanopoulos for pushing the fake narrative:  People just can t get over that election, George.

WATCH TRUMP SUPPORTERS CRASH Pro-Sanctuary City Press Conference Where Radicals Call for Open Borders [Video],"Supporters of the rule of law crashed a pro-illegal rally on August 4, 2017 at San Bernardino City Hall. This was a reaction to San Bernardino getting a letter from Jeff Sessions threatening to withhold their federal funds. Using the left s tactics on them is pretty great:Did you listen to the rhetoric coming from the speakers who were pushing open borders? Shame on them for using religion to break the law! The SEIU has been called Obama s  Purple Army  so they bussed in protesters for the protest They are usually paid to attend protests. They are more like Obama s useful idiots because they lose if more illegals come to take their jobs.The Press Enterprise reported:Attorney General Jeff Sessions  announcement that San Bernardino would not be eligible for crime-reduction funding spurred a demonstration outside San Bernardino City Hall on Friday, Aug. 4.On Thursday, Aug. 3, Sessions sent letters to four cities struggling with gun violence, including San Bernardino, telling them they would not be eligible for a program that provides money to combat drug trafficking and gang crime unless they confirm their cooperation with immigration officials.The letter asks if correctional and detention facilities will honor a written request from the Department of Homeland Security to hold a foreign national for up to 48 hours beyond the scheduled release date.In San Bernardino, that s up to the San Bernardino County Sheriff s Department, not the city. Regardless, the Sheriff s Department, in a statement, said it can t comply because it would be unconstitutional. San Bernardino is not going to be bullied,  said Kesha McGee, a lead organizer with Inland Congregations United for Change, at the planned demonstration.McGee said the interfaith group wanted to show support for the San Bernardino immigrant community.

LIFE IN THE MILITARY ACADEMY: Where Donald J. Trump Played By The Rules and Learned How To Be A Winner,"Many on the left and in the liberal media are hoping President Trump will butt heads with his new chief of staff, former general John Kelly, proving he is incapable of getting along with senior officials in his administration. But if Trump s experience in the New York Military Academy is an indicator, he will surely excel with his new Chief of Staff John Kelly and his disciplined military style.Donald Trump s freewheeling, off-the-cuff campaign style can sometimes make him look like he s winging it. Playing by the rules is not what the billionaire presidential candidate is known for. But during a little-known time in his childhood   military school   playing the game meant following the rules. And Trump learned how to win at it.When Rules Were Meant To Be BrokenBefore military school, Trump was famous for breaking the rules. Long before buildings would be named after him, schoolmates used the Trump name as shorthand for getting into trouble. We used to refer to our detention as a  DT    a  Donny Trump    because he got more of them than most other people in the class,  said Paul Onish, one of Trump s grade school classmates.Onish calls Trump one of his best friends at the Kew-Forest School in Forest Hills, Queens. Trump attended the school through seventh grade, and the two of them got into trouble together constantly   talking out of turn during class, passing notes and throwing spitballs. Onish remembers a few stunts on the soccer field, too. There was even a couple of incidences during half-time when we would eat whole oranges without peeling them in front of the competition to show them how tough we really were,  Onish said.Getting Sent Up The RiverIt was the late 1950s   and in the quiet, well-to-do community of Jamaica Estates, Queens, the nonstop antics became embarrassing for Trump s parents.So right before eighth grade, Trump s father sent him literally up the river to New York Military Academy in the Hudson Valley. Trump would spend the next five years there.Retired Col. Ted Dobias remembers the tall, lanky kid who showed up at his dormitory. I put [him] down at the end of the hall. He didn t know how to make a bed. He didn t know how to shine his shoes. He had a problem, you know, with being a cadet. You know, being a cadet, you gotta take care of yourself,  Dobias said.And Trump the cadet didn t quite know how, at first. Dobias had a reputation for being one of the school s toughest instructors. He was a hardened World War II veteran who made it clear to Trump   he didn t care who his daddy was. When he got out of line, he got the same treatment like everybody else. His name was Donald Trump, like Johnny Jones. It was all the same,  Dobias said.  Nobody was different. We treated everyone alike. When Following The Rules Becomes The GameNew York Military Academy, or NYMA, is tucked in a small speck of a town called Cornwall-on-Hudson. It s a short drive from West Point. Arriving here is like stepping back in time. Antique cannons squat on green fields. Buildings date back to the 1800s.Back in Trump s day, cadets would wake up near the crack of dawn, hurry into their uniforms and march in formation to breakfast. First-year cadets had to eat their meals squared-off   lifting their forks in a right angle path into their mouths. And after breakfast, they d scurry back to clean their rooms for inspection. Dobias said it was a place where kids who didn t like following the rules learned to like it. It s a hell of a thing for a kid to go to a military school   especially when you have to say,  Yes sir,   No sir,  have to learn how to salute, how to do about-face, how to march, how to carry a gun,  said Dobias.But instead of recoiling from the discipline, Trump thrived under it. In her book The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a Presidential Candidate, Gwenda Blair notes how  Donald seemed to welcome being in a place with clear-cut parameters, a place where he could focus on figuring out how to come out on top and get what he wanted. Mike Kabealo, one of Trump s roommates at NYMA, said in the confines of the school s rigid rules, Trump wanted to be a standout. Cocksure, positive and anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better kind of stuff   you know, he was very competitive,  Kabealo said.And friends say Trump channeled that competitiveness into everything at military school. When he was in charge of the rifle rack, he cleaned the rifles obsessively. He was meticulous about his uniform. When it was his turn to do inspections in the barracks, he whipped other cadets into shape. My bed wasn t really made right, and he ripped it,  said Ted Levine, another student who roomed with Trump at NYMA.Trump tore Levine s sheets off during inspections one morning. Levine s bed hadn t passed muster.Trump became captain of the baseball team, and Dobias was his coach. He was very coachable,  Dobias said.  If I told him,  Do this,  he ll do it. If I told him to do it the other way, he ll do it that way. So that s what made him a good baseball player. He accepted criticism. He wanted to be best. Not better. Here s a picture of Trump with his soccer team:Donald Trump s New York Military basketball team photo :Trump was made a cadet captain at NYMA   one of the highest honors for graduates. I don t think he had a handful of loyalists, you know?  Levine, his former roommate, said.  Because he was so competitive that everybody who could come close to him he had to destroy. But now, more than 50 years later, Levine says he and the other guys still kind of admire Trump.Today Levine s office is littered with Donald Trump knickknacks. Like a talking Trump doll that belts out Trumpisms such as  Brand yourself and toot your own horn,  and  Have an ego   there s nothing wrong with ego. Sometimes, Levine said, he squeezes the doll for advice. It s reinforcement   positive reinforcement of true values that are very important for businessmen,  he said.Values like winning   how to fight back and win.Levine gave the doll another squeeze. Never give up,  the doll squawked.  Under any circumstances, never give up.

CLIMATE SCAMMER AL GORE Utterly Embarrassed…Can’t Explain Why Sea Levels Aren’t Rising,"Climate grifter Al Gore is confronted about global warming and sea levels in this classic video where he just can t explain himself.  One of the challenges is taking what the scientists say and believing    Al GoreOUR LATEST ON AL GORE: NASA S NEW CLIMATE DATA Exposes Al Gore s Lies: The Timing of his New Movie Couldn t be More InconvenientAl Gore has become very wealthy from his invention of global warming and the creation of An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary which has been included in the science curricula of schools throughout the United States. However, the more real climate data we see, the more obvious the hoax becomes.This data couldn t come at a worse time for Al Gore, as his sequel to An Inconvenient Truth, released on July 28, got panned by critics.A.V. Club called An Inconvenient Truth  Less a movie than a glorified PowerPoint presentation .A new study from NASA confirms sea levels are falling   not rising.iceagenow.info reports: NASA satellite sea level observations for the past 24 years show that   on average   sea levels have been rising 3.4 millimeters per year. That s 0.134 inches, about the thickness of a dime and a nickel stacked together, per year. As I said, that s the average. But when you focus in on 2016 and 2017, you get a different picture.Sea levels fell in 2016, and with all of this winter s record-breaking snowfall, I wouldn t be surprised if they decline again this year.I clicked and zoomed on the above chart as NASA suggested, and obtained a close-up screen shot of sea levels from Jan 2016 to March 2017. This clearly shows the decline.Al Gore has falsely predicted that sea levels would rise by 20 feet, with some of the world s largest cities underwater.World Tribune reports: Although the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) only predicts a sea level rise of 59cm (17 inches) by 2100, Al Gore in his Oscar-winning film An Inconvenient Truth went much further, talking of 20 feet, and showing computer graphics of cities such as Shanghai and San Francisco half under water, Booker noted. We all know the graphic showing central London in similar plight. As for tiny island nations such as the Maldives and Tuvalu, as Prince Charles likes to tell us and the Archbishop of Canterbury was again parroting last week, they are due to vanish. All of the talk about the sea rising  is nothing but a colossal scare story,  Booker said, citing Swedish geologist and physicist Nils-Axel Morner, formerly chairman of the INQUA International Commission on Sea Level Change, who  for 35 years has been using every known scientific method to study sea levels all over the globe. Despite fluctuations down as well as up,  the sea is not rising,  Morner says.  It hasn t risen in 50 years.  If there is any rise this century it will  not be more than 10cm (four inches), with an uncertainty of plus or minus 10cm . And quite apart from examining the hard evidence, he says, the elementary laws of physics (latent heat needed to melt ice) tell us that  the apocalypse conjured up by Al Gore and Co. could not possibly come about.

PRESIDENT TRUMP’S NEW CHIEF OF STAFF Wants His Boss To Stop Tweeting…But Only About One Thing,"Right before eighth grade, Trump s father sent him literally up the river to New York Military Academy in the Hudson Valley. Trump would spend the next five years there.Retired Col. Ted Dobias remembers the tall, lanky kid who showed up at his dormitory. I put [him] down at the end of the hall. He didn t know how to make a bed. He didn t know how to shine his shoes. He had a problem, you know, with being a cadet. You know, being a cadet, you gotta take care of yourself,  Dobias said.And Trump the cadet didn t quite know how, at first. Dobias had a reputation for being one of the school s toughest instructors. He was a hardened World War II veteran who made it clear to Trump   he didn t care who his daddy was. When he got out of line, he got the same treatment like everybody else. His name was Donald Trump, like Johnny Jones. It was all the same,  Dobias said.  Nobody was different. We treated everyone alike. Back in Trump s day, cadets would wake up near the crack of dawn, hurry into their uniforms and march in formation to breakfast. First-year cadets had to eat their meals squared-off   lifting their forks in a right angle path into their mouths. And after breakfast, they d scurry back to clean their rooms for inspection. Dobias said it was a place where kids who didn t like following the rules learned to like it. It s a hell of a thing for a kid to go to a military school   especially when you have to say,  Yes sir,   No sir,  have to learn how to salute, how to do about-face, how to march, how to carry a gun,  said Dobias.But instead of recoiling from the discipline, Trump thrived under it. In her book The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a Presidential Candidate, Gwenda Blair notes how  Donald seemed to welcome being in a place with clear-cut parameters, a place where he could focus on figuring out how to come out on top and get what he wanted. Mike Kabealo, one of Trump s roommates at NYMA, said in the confines of the school s rigid rules, Trump wanted to be a standout.

When he was in charge of the rifle rack, he cleaned the rifles obsessively. He was meticulous about his uniform. When it was his turn to do inspections in the barracks, he whipped other cadets into shape.   NPRGiven his success in the military academy, is it any surprise then, that President Trump would choose a former general to be his chief of staff?White House Chief of Staff John Kelly aims to stop President Trump from making policy announcements on Twitter, according to a report Friday night.While Kelly acknowledges he can t stop Trump from tweeting, the new chief of staff would like to know what the president plans to tweet before he does so. He would prefer big policy decisions not be announced on Twitter.The goal is  pushing the tweets in the right direction,  Politico reported, citing a White House official.Trump made waves on July 26 when he announced on Twitter that he would ban transgender people from the military:After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow  Donald J.

MAJOR LIBERAL RAG RELUCTANTLY PUBLISHES Article On President Trump’s Outstanding Accomplishments…It’s How They Explain His Successes That Has Everyone Laughing,"The Atlantic, a publication that wouldn t know unbiased journalism if it bit them in the a$$ published what appears to be a reluctant piece on President Trump s outstanding accomplishments during his first 6 months in office. Most of the people reading this piece by The Atlantic are fans of their writing because they ve bought into the progressive, anti-American sentiment they were fed like crack cocaine in college. Almost like the patch that smokers wear to help them get through the withdrawal of nicotine while going through a cessation program, The Atlantic provides their readers with enough anti-Trump propaganda to keep them in business, while acting like a support group for their readers, who fear every anti-American piece of legislation Barack Obama worked so hard to implement, is all unraveling, thanks to this guy who  foolishly  wants  Make America Great Again . Of course, in the eyes of The Atlantic reader, America was never great to begin with.The parts where The Atlantic talks about President Trump s accomplishments are italicized and the comments the writer makes to counter Trump s successes have been highlighted.The Atlantic starts out the article by giving credit to Trump s  shadow government , as somehow being responsible for his amazing successes in his first 6 months. According to The Atlantic, the  actual government  is the fake news stories and the obsession with negative chatter surrounding Trump s presidency, while President Trump s accomplishments have been hidden in the  shadows .The Atlantic  Imagine, if you will, that there is a shadow government.The actual government, the administration of Donald Trump, is coming off the worst week of his presidency, although there haven t been any smooth weeks. Trump s top legislative priority, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, seems dead for the moment. (Tax reform? Forget it.) His administration has set a new standard for chaos and dysfunction, rolling through staffers the way other administrations run through, well, legislative initiatives. Trump s foreign policy remains inchoate and ineffective. Meanwhile, a special counsel investigation looms over the entire administration, threatening both its legitimacy and legal jeopardy for some of its members.Things are going considerably better for the shadow government. With the Trump administration s chaos sucking up all the attention, it s been able to move forward on a range of its priorities, which tend to be more focused on regulatory matters anyway. It is remaking the justice system, rewriting environmental rules, overhauling public-lands administration, and greenlighting major infrastructure projects. It is appointing figures who will guarantee the triumph of its ideological vision for decades to come. let s consider the Trump administration s accomplishments. Spoiler alert: like climate change, they re real.One of the two biggest victories has come on border security, which was one of Trump s top campaign priorities. Border crossings have already plummeted, suggesting that rhetoric making it clear to immigrants that they are not welcome is effective in its own right. Customs and Border Protections report that apprehensions of unauthorized people are down nearly 20 percent from the same time in 2016. (Trump continues to radically exaggerate these figures, though.) This decline has occurred despite Trump being foiled on his actual policy proposals at the border. Construction hasn t begun on his border wall yet, and federal courts have repeatedly smacked down his Muslim travel ban.That said, he did get one good result in courts and that points to a second area of success. The Supreme Court allowed parts of the travel ban to go forward, in a victory that would not have happened without Neil Gorsuch on the court, filling a seat that under all previous customs would have been filled by Barack Obama s appointee Merrick Garland. Given his legislative struggles, the most enduring Trump victories are likely to come in the judicial branch.Trump may get to appoint several more justices to the high court. And in the meantime, he s filling up lower courts with lifetime appointees. As the veteran Democratic official Ron Klain wrote recently,  A massive transformation is underway in how our fundamental rights are defined by the federal judiciary. For while President Trump is incompetent at countless aspects of his job, he is proving wildly successful in one respect: naming youthful conservative nominees to the federal bench in record-setting numbers. There are the quiet, far-reaching changes. Getting back to Pruitt, the environment is one of the places where the Trump administration has had its largest impact. The most prominent move was Trump s June 1 announcement that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. But the EPA is moving on other fronts as well. It s working to dismantle Barack Obama s Clean Power Plan, a signature policy aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. In June, following a February executive order from Trump, the EPA began the process of rescinding the 2015 Waters of the United States rule, which aimed at protecting smaller bodies of water and streams in the same way that larger ones had been. In December, in the closing weeks of his administration, Obama banned drilling in the Arctic and parts of the Atlantic Ocean; the Trump administration promptly set about undoing that ban. (How interested oil companies will be remains to be seen.)The New York Times found in June that Pruitt s EPA  has moved to undo, delay or otherwise block more than 30 environmental rules, a regulatory rollback larger in scope than any other over so short a time in the agency s 47-year history.  And it might have done more if not for constraints imposed by judges. EPA tried to abandon an Obama-era rule on methane emissions, but a court on Monday forced it to continue enforcing the rule.Other agencies are also in on the environmental deregulation act. The State Department reversed an Obama-era decision, clearing the way for the Keystone XL pipeline to begin construction. The Interior Department is considering reversing a rule on fracking on public lands, and might also reverse some equipment regulations on offshore drilling equipment implemented after the 2010 Gulf oil spill. The department has rolled back a ban on coal mining on public lands.Although the Justice Department had staunchly opposed a Texas voting law that has repeatedly been smacked down by courts as discriminatory, Sessions switched the department s position, and it has now told courts the law ought to be allowed to remain. The attorney general has also sought to cut off funding to so-called sanctuary cities, though his legal authority to do so is disputed.Curiously, since he campaigned as an atypically LGBT-friendly Republican, Trump has also made a range of changes on gay issues. Last week alone, the Justice Department announced that sexual orientation was not covered by Section VII, and the president said that transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the military. The administration has also rejected Obama-era protections for transgender students.

UN AMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER Unmasked Hundreds of Trump Associates During 2016 Election [Video],"Adam Kredo of WFB asks the question we all want the answer to:  The fact that this information subsequently leaked to the press, I think raises even more questions about why a U.N ambassador over in Turtle Bay needs to unmask.  Samantha Power is a longtime Obama loyalist but her husband might be the key to all of this (see below).Power is believed to have made  hundreds  of unmasking requests to  identify individuals named in classified intelligence community reports related to Trump and his presidential transition team, according to multiple sources who said the behavior is unprecedented for an official in her position,  according to the Washington Free Beacon.Hannity asked Kredo how Power would ever have the authority to make the unmasking requests, and then asked whether this has ever happened previously to his knowledge. No, it s truly unprecedented,  Kredo said.  It s certainly odd, and I think the House Intelligence Committee, rightfully so, has subpoenaed her to find out what is going on here. Look, it s hundreds of unmasking requests in just the final year of the Obama administration. WE VE FOLLOWED THE  QUEEN OF GEORGE SOROS  AND HERE S WHAT WE KNOW:In 2005 06, Power worked as a foreign policy fellow in the office of U.S. Senator Barack Obama.In a 2007 interview, Power said that America s relationship with Israel  has often led foreign policy decision-makers to defer reflexively to Israeli security assessments, and to replicate Israeli tactics  The United States, she explained, had brought terrorist attacks upon itself by aping Israel s violations of human rights.Power has had her fair share of controversy, specifically after she was forced to resign from the president s 2008 campaign following negative remarks she made about Hillary Clinton.In an interview with The Scotsman during the heat of the 2008 presidential race, Power called Clinton a  monster. Power was soon back in with the Obama camp. Her husband is Obama s former Regulatory Czar Cass Sunstein.SUNSTEIN IS ONE SCARY GUY WHO WANTED GOVERNMENT TO INTRUDE ON YOUR PRIVACY:SALON reported:Cass Sunstein has long been one of Barack Obama s closest confidants. Often mentioned as a likely Obama nominee to the Supreme Court, Sunstein is Obama s head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs where, among other things, he is responsible for  overseeing policies relating to privacy, information quality, and statistical programs.  In 2008, while at Harvard Law School, Sunstein co-wrote a truly pernicious paper proposing that the U.S. Government employ teams of covert agents and pseudo- independent  advocates to  cognitively infiltrate  online groups and websites   as well as other activist groups   which advocate views that Sunstein deems  false conspiracy theories  about the Government. This would be designed to increase citizens  faith in government officials and undermine the credibility of conspiracists. The paper s abstract can be read, and the full paper downloaded, here.Sunstein advocates that the Government s stealth infiltration should be accomplished by sending covert agents into  chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups.  He also proposes that the Government make secret payments to so-called  independent  credible voices to bolster the Government s messaging (on the ground that those who don t believe government sources will be more inclined to listen to those who appear independent while secretly acting on behalf of the Government). This program would target those advocating false  conspiracy theories,  which they define to mean:  an attempt to explain an event or practice by reference to the machinations of powerful people, who have also managed to conceal their role.

"WOW! THE WASHINGTON POST Publishes #RealNews Story About President Trump : Under Trump’s Leadership, Gains Against ISIS Have “Dramatically Accelerated”","The Washington Post   Nearly a third of territory reclaimed from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria since 2014 has been won in the past six months, due to new policies adopted by the Trump administration, a senior State Department official said Friday.Brett McGurk, the State Department s senior envoy to the anti-Islamic State coalition, said that steps President Trump has taken, including delegating decision-making authority down from the White House to commanders in the field, have  dramatically accelerated  gains against the militants.Combined Islamic State losses in both countries since the group s peak control in early 2015 total about 27,000 square miles of territory   78 percent of militant holdings in Iraq and 58 percent in Syria. About 8,000 square miles have been reclaimed under Trump, McGurk said in a briefing for reporters.Although the Trump administration has yet to announce its new strategy for the campaign against the Islamic State, McGurk cited  key changes  under Trump. In addition to the delegation of decision-making authority, which he said has allowed much greater responsiveness to opportunities and changing circumstances, he cited a  campaign of annihilation  that has concentrated on surrounding cities held by the militants before launching offensives, to ensure that no militants will escape.He said the 2,000 militants remaining in Raqqa  most likely will die in Raqqa.  The United Nations has estimated that 25,000 civilians also remain in the city.McGurk, who held the same job in the Obama administration, also cited renewed administration efforts to  increase burden sharing from the coalition  among what he said were 73 countries. Most of them do not contribute to the warfighting but are expected to help with stabilization efforts in cleared areas, including in the Iraqi city of Mosul, where U.S.-backed Iraq security forces declared victory over the Islamic State last month.",politics,"Aug 4, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
4 Of 8 DETROIT MAYORAL Candidates Are Felons…Two Convicted Of Assault With Intent To Commit Murder: “Black marks on your record show you have lived a little…”,"Half of the eight mayoral hopefuls on Detroit s primary ballot next week have been convicted of felony crimes involving drugs, assault or weapons, a Detroit News analysis shows.Three were charged with gun crimes and two for assault with intent to commit murder. Some of the offenses date back decades, the earliest to 1977. The most recent was in 2008.Political consultant Greg Bowens said there are candidates with past hardships in every election cycle. It s not something unique to Detroit or the political arena in general, he said. Black marks on your record show you have lived a little and have overcome some challenges,  said Bowens, a former press secretary to Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer and NAACP activist.  They (candidates) deserve the opportunity to be heard, but they also deserve to have the kind of scrutiny that comes along with trying to get an important elected position. Tuesday s Detroit mayoral primary election is the first since the city exited bankruptcy in 2014. The field of eight will be narrowed to two who will face off in the fall.Under state election law, convicted felons can vote and run for office as long as they are not incarcerated or guilty of certain fraud-related offenses, or crimes involving a breach of the public trust. The Detroit News reviewed the backgrounds of all the mayoral contenders.

AUDIT: Obama’s IRS ‘Misled’ Americans to Get Them to Sign Up for Obamacare,"Soooo the IRS lied to Americans to  prod  them to comply and sign up for Obamacare. They lied about the cost of Obamacare. Does anyone see the criminality in this? It s a classic bait and switch but by our government! The Obama administration  misled  Americans into thinking signing up for Obamacare would be cheaper than it really was, according to an inspector general s report Thursday that said the IRS dramatically understated the actual cost of enrolling. IRS officials sent the letters to try to prod Americans to comply with the 2010 health law s  individual mandate  that penalizes them for not holding coverage.But as part of the letters, the IRS said most people could find plans for $75 a month or less once government subsidies were figured in. That was untrue   in fact, the average cost was more than twice that figure, at $168 a month, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said. Many of the nearly 7.5 million taxpayers who receive letters and seek insurance may feel misled if the actual cost of their insurance is much higher than the $75 per month detailed in their notification letter,  the inspector general concluded. The IRS said it was only using numbers provided by Department of Health and Human Services and verified by the Treasury Department. They said the $75 figure was true for some taxpayers.The inspector general said it asked for that documentation but never received it.Auditors said their own analysis found the HHS studies were based on a smaller sample and was limited to those who chose lower-coverage plans with fewer benefits.According to the new audit, federal regulations require agencies to present accurate information.Investigators uncovered the misleading information as part of a broader audit about how the IRS was handling its role in alerting Americans who aren t complying with Obamacare s mandate to hold insurance.Read more: WT ",politics,"Aug 4, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
WHOA! NEW EMAILS SHOW COMEY FBI LIED About Meeting Between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch On Tarmac…Proves Media Colluded With Obama’s DOJ To Kill Story About Tarmac Meeting [VIDEO],"A new email dump from the FBI via a FOIA request by the ACLJ reveals what appears to be collusion between the media and the DOJ to squash the story about the 2016 meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton on the tarmac in Phoenix, AZ.Also Comey reportedly said the FBI had no documents related to this meeting to fill a prior FOIA request. That apparently isn t true, given this new email dump.  The Right ScoopWatch:From the ACLJ: We have just obtained hundreds of pages in our ongoing investigation and federal lawsuit on former Attorney General Loretta Lynch s tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton while the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI had an ongoing criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails. The results are shocking.Watch Lynch s explanation of her meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac:First, the Comey FBI lied to us. Last July, we sent FOIA requests to both the Comey FBI and the Lynch DOJ asking for any documents related to the Clinton Lynch plane meeting. The FBI, under the then directorship of James Comey, replied that  No records responsive to your request were located. The documents we received today from the Department of Justice include several emails from the FBI to DOJ officials concerning the meeting. One with the subject line  FLAG  was correspondence between FBI officials (Richard Quinn, FBI Media/Investigative Publicity, and Michael Kortan) and DOJ officials concerning  flag[ing] a story . . . about a casual, unscheduled meeting between former president Bill Clinton and the AG.  The DOJ official instructs the FBI to  let me know if you get any questions about this  and provides  [o]ur talkers [DOJ talking points] on this . The talking points, however are redacted.Another email to the FBI contains the subject line  security details coordinate between Loretta Lynch/Bill Clinton? On July 1, 2016   just days before our FOIA request   a DOJ email chain under the subject line,  FBI just called,  indicates that the  FBI . . . is looking for guidance  in responding to media inquiries about news reports that the FBI had prevented the press from taking pictures of the Clinton Lynch meeting. The discussion then went off email to several phone calls (of which we are not able to obtain records). An hour later, Carolyn Pokomy of the Office of the Attorney General stated,  I will let Rybicki know.  Jim Rybicki was the Chief of Staff and Senior Counselor to FBI Director Jim Comey. The information that was to be provided to Rybicki is redacted.Also of note several of the documents contain redactions that are requested  per FBI. It is clear that there were multiple records within the FBI responsive to our request and that discussions regarding the surreptitious meeting between then AG Lynch and the husband of the subject of an ongoing FBI criminal investigation reached the highest levels of the FBI.However, on October 21, 2016, the Comey FBI replied to our legal demands that  No records responsive to your request were located.  This is in direct contravention to the law, and we are preparing further legal action to force the FBI to come clean and turn over ALL documents related to this matter to us in a timely manner.Second, the hundreds of pages of (heavily redacted   more on that below) documents paint a clear picture of a DOJ in crisis mode as the news broke of Attorney General Lynch s meeting with former President Clinton. In fact, the records appear to indicate that the Attorney General s spin team immediately began preparing talking points for the Attorney General regarding the meeting BEFORE ever speaking with the AG about the matter.Third, there is clear evidence that the main stream media was colluding with the DOJ to bury the story. A Washington Post reporter, speaking of the Clinton Lynch meeting story, said,  I m hoping I can put it to rest .  The same Washington Post reporter, interacting with the DOJ spin team, implemented specific DOJ requests to change his story to make the Attorney General appear in a more favorable light. A New York Times reporter apologetically told the Obama DOJ that he was being  pressed into service  to have to cover the story. As the story was breaking, DOJ press officials stated,  I also talked to the ABC producer, who noted that they aren t interested, even if Fox runs with it. Two days after the meeting, DOJ officials in a chain of emails that includes emails to Attorney General Lynch herself stated that the media coverage of the meeting  looks like all or most are FOX  and that  CBS . . . just says a few lines about the meeting. Fourth, DOJ bureaucrats have redacted all the talking points, discussions of talking points, a statement on the meeting that was apparently never delivered because there was not enough media coverage on the meeting, and its substantive discussions with the FBI on the matter. They absurdly claim the  deliberative process exemption  to FOIA, which is only supposed to apply to agency rulemaking processes.The ACLJ won t stop until justice is served on this matter:Discussions about Attorney General Lynch s ethically questionable meeting with former President Clinton during her investigation into Hillary Clinton clearly has nothing to do with any rule making process. We will be taking these redactions back to federal court. The law is on our side. We will keep pressing on with our investigation of former Attorney General Lynch until we get to the bottom of this.To donate to the ACLJ and help to fund the important work they re doing, click HERE.Here s James Comey discussing the Lynch and Clinton meeting on the tarmac:Here is Loretta Lynch s testimony before Congress regarding her meeting with Bill Clinton:",politics,"Aug 4, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
MAXINE WATERS Wants Leaks to Continue…Claims World Leaders are “Glad” about Leaks [Video],"Maxine Waters wants the leaks to continue even if they are confidential!

REPORT: ROBERT MUELLER Targets Trump Son With Grand Jury,"Remember when Chelsea Clinton faced the same scrutiny as the Trump children by the media? Remember when the media scrutinized her involvement in the crooked Clinton Foundation, or when the media asked her why, after the email from her mother was exposed by Wikileaks that she knew the truth about the Benghazi attack having nothing to do with a video, but didn t tell anyone? Remember when the media asked her about her former Secretary of State mother and former President Barack Obama lying about the attack that left 4 Americans dead? Yeah neither do we. According to a Thursday Wall Street Journal report, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been using a federal grand jury to assist his investigation into alleged Russian election interference. The report claims the grand jury has been in operation in Washington, DC for several weeks, although it does not provide a source for this information. As the article acknowledges, grand jury proceedings are typically sealed and participation is kept secret.The grand jury discussed is a different one from the Alexandria, Virginia one impaneled to investigate former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn earlier this year.The exact targets of Mueller s Russia grand jury were not clear from the Journal s report but Reuters followed up the report with an afternoon tweet claiming subpoenas were issued relating to Donald Trump Jr. s meetings with a Russian attorney last year. That meeting and the emails relating to it were the topic of wide media focus last month.In an accompanying report, Reuters specified  two sources  for their claims, indicating those close to the grand jury are breaking the confidence of that body. Leaking information from a grand jury investigation is often a federal crime. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B), the following people, and more, are sworn to secrecy under threat of criminal contempt of court:(i) a grand juror;(ii) an interpreter;(iii) a court reporter;(iv) an operator of a recording device;(v) a person who transcribes recorded testimony;(vi) an attorney for the governmentThe impaneling of a grand jury alone does not indicate any burden of proof has been met or evidence uncovered regarding collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or any other matter under Special Counsel Mueller s purview. Grand juries can be convened effectively at will by an official, like Mueller, with federal prosecutorial power.Grand juries are the means by which federal criminal indictments are issued, but also serve an investigative purpose that is likely an important aim in this case. Once impaneled, the grand jurors can, typically at the express urging of the prosecutor, issue wide-reaching subpoenas and call before them witnesses. In turn, the prosecutor can use this testimony and evidence to assemble a case for probable cause and ask the jury to issue an indictment, all without the defense counsel and other protections with which Americans are familiar from a trial setting.

AG JEFF SESSIONS Warns Leakers…Taking Steps to Stop the Leaks that “Hurt Our Country” [Video],"Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced today that the DOJ is taking steps to reduce the amount of leaking from the White House:Sessions said during his Friday press briefing that everyone in government  can do better  and must practice more discipline when it comes to the leaking of classified information. Simply put, these leaks hurt our country,  Sessions said.  All of us in government can do better. To prevent these leaks every agency and Congress have to do better,  Sessions said.

Why Donald J. Trump Is The Only One Who Can Defeat An Anti-American Party That’s Gone Unopposed For 50 Years ,"Every American should read and share this brilliant article.So, to my friends on the Left   and the #NeverTrumpers as well   do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be  collegial  and  dignified  and  proper ? Of course I do. These aren t those times. This is war. And it s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years.So, say anything you want about this president   I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don t care. I can t spare this man. He fightsHE FIGHTSMy Leftist friends (as well as many ardent #NeverTrumpers) constantly ask me if I m not bothered by Donald Trump s lack of decorum. They ask if I don t think his tweets are  beneath the dignity of the office.  Here s my answer:We Right-thinking people have tried dignity. There could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than George W. Bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency. We tried statesmanship. Could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized  collegiality  as John McCain? We tried propriety   has there been a nicer human being ever than Mitt Romney? And the results were always the same.This is because, while we were playing by the rules of dignity, collegiality and propriety, the Left has been, for the past 60 years, engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of Saul Alinsky and the Chicago mob.I don t find anything  dignified,   collegial  or  proper  about Barack Obama s lying about what went down on the streets of Ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the Democratic Party. I don t see anything  dignified  in lying about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks. I don t see anything  statesman-like  in weaponizing the IRS to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent. Yes, Obama was  articulate  and  polished  but in no way was he in the least bit  dignified,   collegial  or  proper. The Left has been engaged in a war against America since the rise of the Children of the  60s. To them, it has been an all-out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale. It has been a war they ve fought with violence, the threat of violence, demagoguery and lies from day one   the violent take-over of the universities   till today.The problem is, through these years, the Left has been the only side fighting this war. While the Left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way, the Right has continued to act with dignity, collegiality and propriety.With Donald Trump, this all has come to an end. Donald Trump is America s first wartime president in the Culture War.During wartime, things like  dignity  and  collegiality  simply aren t the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors. Ulysses Grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the Army for conduct unbecoming. Had Abraham Lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted Grant, the Democrats might well still be holding their slaves today. Lincoln rightly recognized that,  I cannot spare this man. He fights. General George Patton was a vulgar-talking, son-of-a-bitch. In peacetime, this might have seen him stripped of rank. But, had Franklin Roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum, then Hitler and the Socialists would barely be five decades into their thousand-year Reich.Trump is fighting. And what s particularly delicious is that, like Patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated Rommel s, he s shouting,  You magnificent bastards, I read your book!  That is just the icing on the cake, but it s wonderful to see that not only is Trump fighting, he s defeating the Left using their own tactics.That book is Saul Alinsky s Rules for Radicals   a book so essential to the Liberals  war against America that it is and was the playbook for the entire Obama administration and the subject of Hillary Clinton s senior thesis. It is a book of such pure evil, that, just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted, Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer.Trump s tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but, in reality, he is doing exactly what Alinsky suggested his followers do. First, instead of going after  the fake media    and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past 60 years not just wrong, but diametrically opposed to the truth, from the Tet Offensive to Benghazi, to what really happened on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri   Trump has isolated CNN. He made it personal. Then, just as Alinsky suggests, he employs ridicule which Alinsky described as  the most powerful weapon of all. Everyone gets that it s not just CNN   in fact, in a world where Al Sharpton and Rachel Maddow, Paul Krugman and Nicholas Kristof are people of influence and whose  reporting  is in no way significantly different than CNN s   CNN is just a piker.Most importantly, Trump s tweets have put CNN in an untenable and unwinnable position. With Trump s ability to go around them, they cannot simply stand pat. They need to respond. This leaves them with only two choices.They can either  go high  (as Hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth) and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can double-down on their usual tactics and hope to defeat Trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguery.The problem for CNN (et al.) with the former is, if they were to start honestly reporting the news, that would be the end of the Democratic Party they serve. It is nothing but the incessant use of fake news (read: propaganda) that keeps the Left alive. Imagine, for example, if CNN had honestly and accurately reported then-candidate Barack Obama s close ties to foreign terrorists (Rashid Khalidi), domestic terrorists (William Ayers), the mafia (Tony Rezko) or the true evils of his spiritual mentor, Jeremiah Wright s, church.Imagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the Obama administration s weaponizing of the IRS to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the Mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and the Obama administration s cover-up. This makes  going high  a non-starter for CNN. This leaves them no other option but to ratchet up the fake news, conjuring up the next  nothing burger  and devoting 24 hours a day to hysterical rants about how it s  worse than Nixon. This, obviously, is what CNN has chosen to do. The problem is, as they become more and more hysterical, they become more and more obvious. Each new effort at even faker news than before, and faker  outrage  only makes that much more clear to any objective observer that Trump is and always has been right about the fake news media.And, by causing their hysteria, Trump has forced them into numerous, highly embarrassing and discrediting mistakes. Thus, in their desperation, they have lowered their standards even further and run with articles so clearly fake that, even with the liberal (lower case  l ) libel laws protecting the media, they ve had to wholly retract and erase their stories repeatedly.Their flailing at Trump has even seen them cross the line into criminality, with CNN using their vast corporate fortune to hunt down a private citizen for having made fun of them in an Internet meme. This threat to  dox    release of personal information to encourage co-ideologists to visit violence upon him and his family   a political satirist was chilling in that it clearly wasn t meant just for him. If it were, there would have been no reason for CNN to have made their  deal  with him public.Instead, CNN   playing by  Chicago Rules    was sending a message to any and all: dissent will not be tolerated. This heavy-handed and hysterical response to a joke on the Internet has backfired on CNN, giving rise to only more righteous ridicule.So, to my friends on the Left   and the #NeverTrumpers as well   do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be  collegial  and  dignified  and  proper ? Of course I do. These aren t those times. This is war. And it s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years.So, say anything you want about this president   I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don t care. I can t spare this man. He fights.Townhall published this brilliant article on July 13, 2017.

DEMOCRATIC SENATOR Justifies Leaking of Trump’s Phone Conversations [Video],"Senator Jeanne Shaheen justifies leaking phone conversations of President Trump! She says that Trump s tweeting is  a problem  and that it s a  serious situation . She s on the Foreign Relations Committee!MSNBC s Chris Matthews asked Shaheen what she thought of officials leaking the conversations: My experience is that when people feel like they need to leak something like that, it s because they have concerns about what s going on and I think that s one of the challenges. When we have a president who tries to make national security policy or foreign policy through tweeting, then we have a problem, and my guess is that s why people are leaking this kind of information, because they want the public to know how serious this situation is. What in the world is this woman talking about? Under no circumstances is this ok! Shaheen is on the Foreign Relations Committee!

FOX LEGAL EXPERT CALLS OUT ‘PARTIAL’ MUELLER: Must Resign After Latest Hire Who Was Appointed by Obama [Video],"Gregg Jarrett says Mueller must resign after his latest new hire for the panel of lawyers.

Fitton said:  I don t understand what this investigation is about.. You know my count is 14, 15 lawyers to have working on this one investigation to investigate to investigate what? An employment dispute between Comey and the President? You have the conflicts caused by Comey leaking records to get Mueller appointed, you have Constitutional concerns about the way the office operates.

Sununu:  If the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice, the White House should have been officially notified. Sununu:  What bothers me the most and there must be a reason for it, is Mueller making four of his first hires so blatantly biased lawyers, pro-Democrat lawyers with a bias certainly against the President. Maybe Mueller has decided internally that this isn t going anywhere and that the only way he can have credibility on a decision saying that there s nothing there is to have that decision come from a group of lawyers that are so blatantly biased against the President.

"McMaster Gave Susan Rice Continued Access To Classified Info, She Still Has Clearance","This very important scandal is unfolding before us. It has many, many  legs  with different Obama administration officials involved. Don t count on the main stream media to fill you in. This is a big deal!Andrew McCarthy said it best: The national-security adviser is not an investigator. She is a White House staffer. The president s staff is a consumer of intelligence, not a generator or collector of it. If Susan Rice was unmasking Americans, it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on American interests; it was to fulfill a political desire based on Democratic-party interests. Circa News has been uncovering disturbing information regarding the  unmasking  of American citizens and how Obama provided a way for the unmasking to go  unfettered . Susan Rice and Samantha Power both have  unfettered access  to classified material and likely unmasked many in government. Sara Carter reports below on H.R. McMaster s involvement in this unmasking:Almost one month after it was disclosed that former President Obama s National Security Adviser Susan Rice was unmasking members of President Trump s team and other Americans, Trump s own national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, sent an official letter giving her unfettered and continuing access to classified information and waiving her  need-to-know  requirement on anything she viewed or received during her tenure, Circa has confirmed.The undated and unclassified letter from McMaster was sent in the mail to Rice s home during the last week of April. Trump was not aware of the letter or McMaster s decision, according to two Senior West Wing officials and an intelligence official, who spoke to Circa on condition that they not be named. This is the letter from McMaster to Rice. Names, phone numbers and personal addresses have been blurred. I hereby waive the requirement that you must have a  need-to-know  to access any classified information contained in items you  originated, reviewed, signed or received while serving,  as National Security Adviser,  the letter said. The letter also states that the  NSC will continue to work with you to ensure the appropriate security clearance documentation remains on file to allow you access to classified information. Circa revealed in March that during President Obama s tenure, top aides   including Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch   routinely reviewed intelligence reports received from the National Security Agency s incidental intercepts of Americans abroad. They were doing so by taking advantage of rules Obama relaxed starting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism, espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats, according to documents obtained by Circa.In June, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Rice as part of the committee s larger investigation into the unmasking of Americans under the Obama administration. Rice maintains that she never accessed the information inappropriately and has agreed to testify before the committee.Under the law, and under certain conditions, it is common practice for some senior government officials to be given the unfettered access to classified information, and their  need to know  is waived under  Executive Order 13526 Section 4.4 Access by Historical Researchers and Certain Former Government Personnel.  But the White House officials told Circa that under the current congressional investigation, and given President Trump s ongoing concern that members of his team were unmasked, Rice s clearance should have been limited to congressional testimony only or revoked until the end of the investigation. Rice and Brennan have confirmed they sought the unredacted names of Americans in NSA-sourced intelligence reports, but insisted their requests were routine parts of their work and that they did nothing improper. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power also has legal authority to unmask officials.In a June tweet, Trump called the revelation that Rice and other Obama senior officials were unmasking members of his team the  big story  the  unmasking and surveillance  that took place during the Obama administration. Basically, this letter which was signed in the last week of April undercuts the president s assertion that Susan Rice s unmasking activity was inappropriate. In essence, anybody who committed a violation as she did would not be given access to classified information,  said a senior West Wing official, who was shown the document by Circa and verified its authenticity.  In fact, they would have their security clearance and right to  need-to-know  stripped. The point is, is that it lowers the bar for her,  the Senior West Wing official said. This memo McMaster sent to Rice makes it so that she doesn t have to prove a continuing  need-to-know  to have access to classified information and in effect is a White House pardon of Susan Rice and could be used by other Obama officials who conducted targeted unmasking of the campaign as a defense,  the official added.REMEMBER THAT RICE RECENTLY LIED AGAIN ABOUT THE UNMASKING   SHE DID IT ON NATIONAL TV:If the Obama administration was good at anything, it was good at lying to hijack the narrative.Remember when Susan Rice lied after Benghazi? It is what she does so well. Flash forward to the latest hot water she s in and it s hard to tell what she d want us believe this time WHICH SHOULD WE BELIEVE? WHAT SHE SAID TO ANDREA MITCHELL OR TO JUDY WOODRUFF?Susan Rice appeared on Andrea Mitchell. She claimed she didn t leak  nothing to nobody Did you catch that double negative?There might be more to that because she s using words in the two sentences very carefully .Check it out:SUSAN RICE VERSION ONE:WATCH: Susan Rice insists  I leaked nothing to nobody  https://t.co/kAsbu4VJDN  MSNBC (@MSNBC) April 4, 2017SUSAN RICE VERSION TWO: I know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today. What she says is a lie but who is surprised by this? We know that Susan Rice lied 5 times on 5 different morning shows the morning after Benghazi. Why wouldn t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including Obama.Susan Rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now. She claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it. Yes, red flags are everywhere on this! The reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the Trump presidency and embarrass him:The bottom line is that laws were broken when the names were unmasked Someone s in BIG trouble!Read more: circa news",politics,"Aug 3, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
TRINITY COLLEGE TAKES MAJOR HIT With Donors After Reinstating Professor Who Sided With Sanders Supporter That Opened Fire On Republicans: “White People Should ‘F***ing Die”,"Four days after James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on a group of Republican congressmen at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, Trinity Professor Johnny Eric Williams sided with anonymous blogger  Son of Baldwin,  who proposed that black emergency personnel should let wounded white people die rather than lend assistance. Baldwin posted his opinions under the hashtag, #LetThemFuckingDie.Professor Williams linked Son of Baldwin s statement, adopted the hashtag as his own, and posted some additional denunciations of white Americans for  their destructive mythology of whiteness and their white supremacy system.  Referring to all  self-identified  whites,  he wrote,  The time is now to confront these inhuman assholes and end this now. When Campus Reform broke the story on June 20, it rapidly spread through the media. Trinity College put Professor Williams on leave, beginning June 26.But after Trinity Dean and Vice President Tom Cresswell reviewed Williams  statements, he returned with a 31-page report that found his Facebook posts were  extramural utterances  protected by Trinity College s policy of academic freedom. Trinity College President Joanne Berger-Sweeney endorsed Dean Cresswell s findings, and added that she doesn t  condone the hashtag  which  offend[s] me personally  and  contradicts our fundamental institutional values.  Nevertheless, Williams has been reinstated in good standing.Trinity reached the decision because, like many other colleges, it has failed to draw meaningful lines between valid and invalid claims on academic freedom. That failure plunges colleges ever deeper into the mire of ethnic chauvinism, categorical hatreds, anti-intellectual diatribe, mind-deadening vulgarity, and psychopathology. Worse, we are getting used to this mire and finding it harder to defend essential distinctions. If we are at the point where #LetThemFuckingDie is upheld as a wholesome exercise in  extra-mural  academic speech, we are in serious trouble.   The FederalistThe hate-filled anti-white professor s disgusting Facebook comments didn t come without a price. Trinity College has reported to have lost 16 students and $200,000 in donations as a result of sociology professor Johnny Eric Williams.Washington Times   Trinity College President Joanne Berger-Sweeney sent a letter to school community members on Monday that detailed financial losses attributable to a Mr. Williams  racial tirade. He attracted national media attention after calling white people  inhuman a-holes  who need to  die  just days after a gunman critically wounded Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise and targeted other Republican lawmakers for assassination. We can and will recover from the financial cost of this incident; the work before us now is to heal as a community,  Ms. Berger-Sweeney wrote, the Hartford Courant reported Tuesday. The official said that she was  disappointed  in the wake of decisions by angry donors and former students, but offered respect  and hope that those individuals ultimately will see that there continue to be many good reasons to invest in Trinity. If you see [white people] drowning. If you see them in a burning building. If they are bleeding out in an emergency room. If the ground is crumbling beneath them. If they are in a park and they turn their weapons on each other: do nothing,  a June 16 article by  Son of Baldwin  says.  Let. Them. F-ing. Die. And smile a bit when you do,  an article shared on the professor s Facebook page on June 18 said.Mr. Williams was placed on leave after the scandal broke, but a report issued July 14 reinstated him and paved the way for a January 2018 return to the classroom.The Federalist   Trinity s dilemma is in large part a matter of a double standard, created to coddle black radicals on campus. The prevailing view among colleges and universities is that robust declarations of racial resentment by African-American professors or students should be considered within the bounds of academic freedom. This allowance is a one-way street. Similarly abusive language from a white or Asian professor would almost certainly be met with severe sanctions.Trinity s decision is but one incident of many in which college officials granted a pass to  hate speech  by radical professors. In 2015, Boston University Professor Saida Grundy received a slap on the wrist after tweeting:  Why is America so reluctant to identify white college males as a population problem?  Earlier this year, Texas A&M Professor Tommy Curry quietly skirted dismissal after an interview emerged in which he said  look, in order to be equal, in order to be liberated, some white people may have to die.  Students too get a pass.Gordon Barnes, editor-in-chief of The Advocate, the CUNY graduate student newspaper, published an editorial in fall 2014  In Support of Violence.  Barnes declared,  The time for peace has passed; indeed it never existed in this country.  He specifically called for violence against the police:  Violence directed towards state representatives is not only warranted, it is necessary.  CUNY apparently thought nothing amiss in Barnes  extra-mural utterances. To the contrary, in 2017 the CUNY Graduate Center featured Barnes for a  Ph.D. Snapshot  to advertise its history program.Remarks by a faculty member or a graduate student advocating violence against racial groups might well be reasonable grounds for strong sanctions, including possible dismissal. But this hasn t happened because colleges and universities have appointed so many faculty members who present themselves as authentic voices of black rage. It is plainly difficult to call someone to account for doing exactly what he was hired to do. Rage-filled black professors are not going to lose their positions for expressing rage.This situation grew out of decades in which colleges went out of their way to appoint black faculty members who held separatist views and who affected angry attitudes as a badge of authenticity. The initial impetus for such appointments came from liberal white professors who argued that recruiting in this vein would help the colleges retain black students, many of whom couldn t seem to come to grips with the traditional curriculum and the mostly white faculty that taught it.We saw this reflected in the Faculty Minutes of Bowdoin College, when we were researching the study that became  What Does Bowdoin Teach?  Faced with the skepticism of his colleagues, Professor Daniel Levine pushed for the immediate creation of Afro-American Studies in 1969. Bowdoin had no one qualified to teach the program. Levin responded by insisting, over and over,  It must be so!  He got his way. Bowdoin dived head first into creating a program grounded in angry politics, rather than scholarship.",politics,"Aug 3, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"DEMOCRAT HEADS SET TO EXPLODE: Feds Waive Environmental Regulations To Begin Construction On 15-Mile Border Wall At Site Of 31,000 Illegal Alien Apprehensions","The Department of Homeland Security announced its plans to build a 15-mile prototype of the border wall in San Diego.The department issued a waiver from numerous environmental laws and regulations to build the wall with  robust physical characteristics  to prevent illegal immigration crossings in an area of  high illegal entry. The Department is implementing President Trump s Executive Order 13767, Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements, and continues to take steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border,  the department said in a statement Tuesday announcing plans to issue the waiver.In one of his last moves as DHS secretary, Gen. John Kelly signed the notice on July 26, before he was tapped to serve as White House chief of staff.The waiver was published in the Federal Register on Wednesday.The notice outlines the plans for projects along a 15-mile stretch along the Southwestern border in the San Diego sector. The department said the area is in need of further border protection immediately, as it is the site of over 31,000 illegal alien apprehensions, the seizure of 9,167 pounds of marijuana, and approximately 1,317 pounds of cocaine last year alone. The construction of border wall prototypes in the Project Area and the robust physical characteristics that are to be incorporated into the border wall prototypes are intended to deter illegal crossings,  the notice states.The department will waive several environmental regulations to build the prototype wall, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and a host of others.DHS said it is still committed to safeguarding the environment but is eliminating onerous rules that would delay construction.For entire story: Washington Free Beacon",politics,"Aug 3, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
KID ROCK BAND MEMBER PREDICTS: ‘That F*cker Could Win’ Senate Race,"Kid Rock Keyboardist Jimmie Bones is shocked but sure that Kid Rock could win it all and defeat Senator Debbie Stabenow to be the new Senator from Michigan.In an interview with Billboard, Kid Rock keyboardist Jimmie Bones said his bandmate has a good shot at defeating incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) when he decides to officially enter the race. Y know what? That f*cker could win, that s what I think,  Bones told the outlet.  He could very well pull this off. A lot of people thought Trump couldn t win and was just a joke, and lo and behold here we are. In Michigan [Rock] could very well win. Bones jokingly volunteered to serve as Senator Rock s  Secretary of Useless Information. Kid Rock has announced voter registration drives but has yet to declare his candidacy for the US Senate. His interest in running has concerned incumbent Debbie Stabenow enough that she s warned supporters. Let s hope this happens.HERE S WHY THE DEMOCRATS ARE SCARED HE LL RUN:Kid Rock did an interview with liberal former CNN host Piers Morgan in 2013. During that interview, it s clear that Bob Ritchie, aka Kid Rock, who is a rock star in more ways that one in the state of Michigan, has many similarities to President Donald Trump.Piers Morgan starts out his interview by pointing out that after he and Kid Rock spent several hours together during his interview, when Rock was asked about his time with Piers, he responded,  Who the (bleep) is Piers Morgan? , giving the impression that the leftist media doesn t really have much value in his eyes, or at the very least, he doesn t hold them in very high regard.Watch:Part II of Kid Rock s interview with Piers Morgan delves into Rock s political views on gun control, abortion, gay marriage and his support for the Republican Party. Although his pro-choice stance won t likely resonate with many Republicans, there will be a number of pro-choice Republicans as well as crossover Democrats and pro-life Independents his pro-choice stance will appeal to. He also touches on Rock s decision to raise his son Robert James Ritchie Jr. by himself, that he fathered with his on again, off again girlfriend he d been dating since the 8th grade.",politics,"Aug 3, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
WATCH: 10-YR OLD BOY Offers To Mow White House Lawn…President Trump Accepts…Invites Him To White House,"Note to media: If you won t report the good things surrounding Trump s spectacular 6 months in office, including positive stories involving scores of his supporters of all ages, ethnicities and genders, Sarah Huckabee Sanders will.Here's Sarah Huckabee Sanders reading a letter from 10-year-old Frank from Virginia https://t.co/0TCpj3P2xE  Meg Wagner (@megwagner) August 2, 2017This smart little entrepreneur clearly touched the president s heart with this letter: Dear Mr. President,It would be my honor to mow the White House lawn for some weekend for you, even though I m only 10, I d like to show the nation what young people like me are ready for. I admire your business background and have started my own business. I ve been mowing my neighbors  lawns for some time, please see the attached flyer, here s a list of what I have and you re free to pick whatever you want: power mower, push mower, and weed whacker, I can bring extra fuel for the power mower and charge batteries for the weed whacker, and I ll do that with no charge.Sincerely,Frank. Huckabee-Sanders, who is a mother of 3 young children, was probably tickled pink to offer President Trump s response to this ambitious young man in person: Frank, I m happy to report back to you that I just spoke with the President, he wanted me to be sure and tell you that you re doing a great job and keep working hard. He also asked me, we found out when we called, to let you know that we would be reading this letter to wish you a happy birthday.

Verified #FakeNews AP Attempts To Discredit Fox News Over Alleged Fake Seth Rich Story…Worries Shepard Smith’s Reputation Could Be Harmed,"AP published an article today that attempts to discredit the very popular Fox News cable network over their coverage of the Seth Rich murder. Instead of questioning Fox News  coverage of the Seth Rich murder case, perhaps Americans should be questioning why the AP is NOT covering the suspicious case of the Seth Rich murder.An excerpt from the ridiculous AP story including the photo-shopped photo they used to discredit FOX can be found below. How professional is this photo? David Bauder, the writer for this AP hit piece on Fox News actually said that he hopes for the sake of their more liberal hosts like Shepard Smith, that the story isn t true, yet the AP publishes a huge picture of Fox News with an electronic banner that appears to be on the front of the Fox News studio:  the fake news media and Trump (illegible) . We re pretty sure you don t post an inflammatory photo-shopped picture (like the one below) if you re not trying to discredit Fox News.NEW YORK (AP)   Things had started settling down following a tumultuous year at Fox News Channel before it was hit with a cover headline in the New York Daily News,  Fake News Channel,  and questions about the independence of its journalists on Wednesday.A defamation lawsuit filed this week accuses the network of making up quotes and pushing a false story that benefits President Donald Trump, even inviting the chief executive into the editorial process.In essence, Fox is accused of creating fake news to debunk a story Trump has complained is fake news. The charge is a very serious one, if substantiated,  said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, communications professor and director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.  It speaks to the credibility of Fox as a news organization. In a year, Fox has been hit by the forced departures of its late chairman, Roger Ailes, and most popular personality, Bill O Reilly, following harassment charges. Ailes  successor, Bill Shine, resigned, prime-time hosts Megyn Kelly and Greta Van Susteren left and there have been several sexual harassment and race discrimination lawsuits.Yet the network s conservative audience has remained mostly loyal. While not as dominant as it was before MSNBC s resurgence in the past few months, Fox ranked as the most popular prime-time network on cable television in July for the fifth time in the past seven months, the Nielsen company said.Fox hosts like Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and the team on Trump s favorite morning show  Fox & Friends  make no secret of their opinions, and those shows have strongly backed Trump in his first six months. Fox, though, is different from some politically oriented news organizations in maintaining a staff of respected journalists who try to play it straight   people like Shepard Smith, Chris Wallace, Bret Baier and John Roberts.We hate to tell you AP, but about 99% of Fox News viewers wish Shepard Smith would go away That s the side of Fox that would be most damaged if the allegations are proven true, since they involved the reporting of an investigative news story on the network s web site, not material from its opinion programs. Any news organization that has any aspirations of being bona fide expects the public to take what they are saying seriously, not that they are being fed something that is being made up,  said Paul Levinson, chairman of Fordham University s communications department. I m no fan of Fox, but I m hoping this turns out not to be the case. The private detective who filed the lawsuit, Rod Wheeler, said he was paid to investigate the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich by a wealthy GOP donor anxious to establish a link between Rich and the leak of emails damaging to Hillary Clinton s campaign. The idea was if that could be done, it would end stories about Trump s possible collusion with Russians.Really AP? Do you have proof of your allegations that the Seth Rich story was manufactured to  end stories about Trump s possible collusion with Russians? So far, there hasn t been one iota of truth that substantiates the leftist media s fabricated Trump-Russia collusion story, but there seems to be an awful lot of evidence pointing to the fact that the former DNC staffer Seth Rich s murder was not about a robbery. On June 30, 2017 Breitbart News caught the AP publishing a totally manufactured story about a meeting between Trump s EPA administrator and Dow Chemical s CEO that never happened :Breitbart- June 30, 2017: The Associated Press is at it again, pushing more fake news. Sadly, the once-great news wire service is trying to cover up its mistake nearly the exact mistake that cost three editorial staffers at CNN their jobs in a scandal that first exploded a week ago today.A Breitbart News investigation has led to the correction by the Associated Press which originally resisted of the fake news it printed as deeper questions of responsibility, accountability, and journalistic ethics consume the AP heading into Fourth of July weekend.This time, the Associated Press invented an imaginary meeting between EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris, and then alleged that some kind of impropriety happened as a result.This is exactly the same mistake CNN made a week ago, when it alleged that Anthony Scaramucci the founder of SkyBridge Capital and an associate and ally of President Donald Trump held  meetings  with Russian investment fund leaders and was under investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee and Treasury Department as a result.A Breitbart News investigation uncovered that no such  meetings  took place, the Senate Intelligence Committee was not investigating the matter, and the Treasury Department had already at the urging of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to now Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before Trump s inauguration looked into it and determined the matter to be entirely  without merit. The very fake news scandal that is consuming CNN right now is the biggest scandal in the network s history, and comes as media D.C.-wide find themselves under intense scrutiny amid a litany of industry mistakes.Breitbart News s investigation into CNN s very fake news piece forced the network to retract it and has led to the resignation of three top officials from inside CNN. Now that the Associated Press has made literally the exact same mistake with different actors and players alleging a meeting took place that never occurred, something that supposedly led to something untoward that also didn t happen the news wire service is not stepping up and holding its staff to the same level of accountability. The only difference between the CNN scandal and this AP scandal is that the AP did not also inaccurately allege the existence of non-existent Senate and Treasury investigations.",politics,"Aug 2, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE is Strongly ‘Denounced’ by Brent Bozell for being a Fake Conservative ‘with no Conscience’,"Brent Bozell does political commentary on Fox News. He just put the hurt on FAKE CONSERVATIVE Senator Jeff Flake with a great oped calling Flake out for being a RINO On behalf of my late father and my family, I am denouncing Senator Jeff Flake and his new book, dishonestly titled, Conscience of a Conservative.Since entering the Senate in 2013, Jeff Flake has, time and again, proven he is part of the indulgent hypocrisy in Washington. While he waxes poetically about conservative principles, his Conservative Review Liberty score is an abysmal 53%, also known as:  F . In 2013, I watched first-hand as Flake refused to sign a letter pledging to defund ObamaCare, among his many betrayals to conservatism. Jeff Flake is neither a conservative nor does he have a conscience.As every conservative leader knows, my father, L. Brent Bozell, Jr., ghost-wrote Conscience of a Conservative for Barry Goldwater. While the Goldwater Institute may own the rights to the book s title, neither the organization nor Senator Flake have the right to unjustifiably trade on my father s work. Conscience of a Conservative is the greatest selling polemic in history, and Senator Flake is trading on its reputation to shamelessly promote himself and disguise his own conservative deficiencies. My father would be appalled to see this fraud as the author of the so-called  sequel,  which it most certainly is not.The media need to know, when reporting on Senator Flake and his  book,  that the author is a deceiver out for personal and financial gain. I also call on my conservative brethren to denounce this impostor, who dishonorably claims to speak for conservatism, in the strongest possible terms.  ~ Brent Bozel",politics,"Aug 2, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

He s so well versed on immigration and American history that he could take on anyone and win in a debate! We love the guy! He s a PATRIOT!FYI: The Statue of Liberty had nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with immigration.

"PRESIDENT TRUMP Explains New “America First” RAISE Act…No More Welfare For New Immigrants, Migrants…Favors English Speaking Immigrants…Protects Jobs For Minorities, US Workers From Being Replaced And MORE! [VIDEO]","That s what we re talking about! Another campaign promise kept. No wonder the Democrats and their media allies fear President Trump. When is the last time a politician actually followed through on a promise they made to the American voters that helped them to get elected?President Trump joined two Republican senators on Wednesday to champion legislation overhauling legal immigration in America, calling for a merit-based system that would significantly cut admissions over the next decade.Speaking at the White House, the president called it  the most significant reform to our immigration system in a half century. As a candidate, I campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects U.S. workers and taxpayers, and that is why we are here today,  Trump said.He was joined by Georgia Sen. David Perdue and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republicans who first introduced the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy, or the RAISE Act, in February. They have said the legislation aims to reduce the number of green cards issued in half from 1 million to 500,000 a year.Trump, Perdue and Cotton argued on Tuesday that low-skilled and unskilled immigration into the United States has depressed wages.According to a fact sheet released to reporters, the new system would favor immigrants who are educated, speak English and have high-paying job offers. It would also reduce low-skilled and unskilled labor immigration.Trump said new immigrants must be able to  financially support themselves and their families. The RAISE Act prevents new migrants and new immigrants from collecting welfare and protects U.S. workers from being displaced,  the president said.  And that s a very big thing, they re not going to come in and just immediately go and collect welfare. The bill would prioritize immediate family members of United States residents, including spouses and young children. But it would end prioritization for extended family members and adult children of residents.The legislation also eliminates the Diversity Visa lottery system and limits permanent resident status for refugees to 50,000 a year.Trump lamented how the country has  record numbers of green cards to low-wage immigrants.  The White House said most of the 1 million immigrants who are accepted into the United States for legal permanent residency every year are low or unskilled workers.Among the hardest hit by this, the president said, are minority workers, who he said are  competing for jobs against brand new arrivals. It has not been fair to our people, to our citizens, to our workers,  he said.The administration also said 50 percent of immigrant households receive welfare benefits, as opposed to 30 percent of native households in the country.

REPUBLICANS DON’T NEED A SINGLE DEMOCRAT To Fund Trump’s Border Wall…So What’s The Holdup?,"Yesterday, Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted a video of himself on the Mexican border flying in a helicopter and traveling on horseback with US border agents. RT if you agree  It is time for The Wall. pic.twitter.com/s5MO8SG7SL  Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) August 1, 2017It makes for great theater to see Republican Speaker Ryan pleading the case for a border wall, but how sincere are the GOP about building the border wall? Even after posting a video that appears to show Ryan s support for the wall, he still seems unsure of himself. It s almost as though he s testing the political winds when he asks Twitter users to retweet if they agree that we need to start building the wall. How committed is the (formerly?) anti-Trump Paul Ryan to building the border wall that would fulfill one of President Trump s most popular campaign promises to the American people? Does he have the what it takes to defy the wishes of corporate donors and the US Chamber of Commerce, and do the right thing for the national security and well-being of our nation?The Last Refuge- Republicans are in control of the House of Representatives, Republicans are in control of the Senate, a Republican President is in the White House, and somehow there s  negotiations  on how to fund the #1 campaign promise of President Donald Trump, the border wall.Here s the rub.Here s what pundits never discuss.The Republican party doesn t need a single Democrat to fund the border wall.A single spending bill could come from the House of Representatives that fully funds 100% of the border wall. The spending bill then goes to the senate, where again, it doesn t need a single Democrat vote because spending legislation is specifically what  reconciliation  was designed to facilitate. That House bill can pass the Senate with 51 votes and proceed directly to the President s desk for signature.So, ask yourself: why is this even a point of discussion?The honest answer, for those who are no longer suffering from Battered Conservative Syndrome, is that Republicans don t want to fund or build an actual physical barrier known as the Southern Border Wall.It really is that simple.If one didn t know better, they d almost think Speaker Ryan was attempting to emulate the man he clearly despised during the 2016 presidential campaign. Yesterday, Ryan tweeted:  Make America the best  once again?  Hmmm interesting choice of words Paul. Ryan wouldn t want anyone to think he was backing our President in his quest to  Make America Great Again! or as it gets closer to Ryan s bid for re-election, maybe he s starting to warm up to the very popular President Trump?

BROTHER OF SETH RICH Works For Cyber Security Firm…Reportedly BLOCKED Family’s Private Investigator From Determining If Seth Was Wikileaks Source…Refused To Let Investigator See Seth’s Computer: “I already checked it…Don’t worry about it”,"What the heck is going on? Why is the media, who has been virtually silent about former DNC staffer Seth Rich s death until now, coming out to attack President Trump and his administration, accusing them of pushing a false narrative about his murder? Shouldn t every American regardless of political affiliation want to get to the bottom of Rich s suspicious death? Why is there so much secrecy and mystery surrounding the staffer who was getting ready to move over to the Hillary campaign when he was murdered on the streets of DC, only blocks from his home early in the morning, after he was last seen leaving a local bar he frequented. The DC police called it a robbery. The  robbers  didn t take his wallet, the contents of his wallet or his expensive watch.Aaron Rich, who had reportedly been blocking his family s private investigator from looking into whether or not his brother Seth was a WikiLeaks source, works for an influential defense contractor that provides cyber security.According to a source close to the Rich family, Aaron works for Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world in 2015. The source did not provide what his specific role is at the company. It s not just hacking and defending, there s a lot more to it,  a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company s website.As we previously reported, Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection according to Rod Wheeler, who was brought on as a private investigator in his brother s murder case.Wheeler said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth s computer, even though there could be evidence on it.  He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,  Wheeler said.  I said, well can I look at it? He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Don t worry about it. Aaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder. All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that s it,  Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler s claim on the audio. Wheeler said that Seth s father Joel  does not appear to have any hidden agenda. Rich was shot in the back in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, near his home while he was on the phone with his girlfriend   12 days before the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks. The police initially ruled that it was a botched robbery   but his wallet, watch, and necklace were still on his person when he was discovered by police.Big League Politics has also released an audio recording of journalist Seymour Hersh stating that Seth Rich was in fact WikiLeaks  source.Listen to the Seymour Hersh interview here: All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I m sure dozens of emails, and said  I want money.  Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,  he said. They got access to the DropBox. Hersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him,  the word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that  if anything happens to me it s not going to solve your problems,  he added.  WikiLeaks got access before he was killed.

COLLEGES MAY BE FORCED To Stop Pushing Qualified White Students To Back Of Line.. DOJ Will Take On Affirmative Action In College Admissions,"The Trump administration is preparing to redirect resources of the Justice Department s civil rights division toward investigating and suing universities over affirmative action admissions policies deemed to discriminate against white applicants, according to a document obtained by The New York Times.The document, an internal announcement to the civil rights division, seeks current lawyers interested in working for a new project on  investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions. The announcement suggests that the project will be run out of the division s front office, where the Trump administration s political appointees work, rather than its Educational Opportunities Section, which is run by career civil servants and normally handles work involving schools and universities.The document does not explicitly identify whom the Justice Department considers at risk of discrimination because of affirmative action admissions policies. But the phrasing it uses,  intentional race-based discrimination,  cuts to the heart of programs designed to bring more minorities to university campuses.Supporters and critics of the project said it was clearly targeting admissions programs that can give members of generally disadvantaged groups, like black and Latino students, an edge over other applicants with comparable or higher test scores.For entire story: NYT sIs it legal for colleges and universities to use race as a deciding factor for purposes of admission? In 1997, one brave student took on the University of Michigan and their unfair practice of making the race of the student applicant a much higher priority than the accomplishments of the student when making admission decisions. Meanwhile, a second lawsuit on behalf of Barbara Grutter against the University of Michigan Law was also filed. Both Gratz and Grutter s cases  ended up in the US Supreme Court.Here s what happened:In 2003, the Supreme Court decided the landmark cases of Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger. Several years after CIR s historic victory in the Fifth Circuit, Hopwood v. Texas, which struck down the use of racial preferences in all states in the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit court of Appeals upheld the use of the racial preferences program at the University of Michigan. Because of the contrary conclusions of law reached by the Circuit Courts, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.CIR successfully urged the Supreme Court to strike down the racial preferences system at the University of Michigan s College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, but the Court left the door open for universities to continue using racial preferences under narrow circumstances and allowed the University of Michigan s law school to continue its practice of utilizing race-based admissions.Jennifer Gratz applied to the University of Michigan s undergraduate College of Literature, Arts, and Sciences in 1994, when she was still a high-school senior in a suburb of Detroit. In high-school, she worked as a math tutor, a cheerleader, and served as her Class Congress Representative. She scored 25 on the ACT (in the 83rd percentile) and graduated high-school with a 3.765 GPA. Despite these accomplishments, Gratz was put on a waitlist before ultimately being denied admission to the University.At the time Gratz applied, the University analyzed prospective applicants under a grid system. Gratz combined ACT/GPA scores placed her just outside the  presumptive admit  portion of the grid used to analyze her results. However, the University had a separate grid for analyzing potential applicants it considered  underrepresented minorities.  On this second grid, Gratz s score placed her far above the minimum threshold of automatic admission.On their own merit, Gratz s achievements gave her a competitive chance of gaining admission. But if the University had considered Gratz as a favored minority applicant, she would have had a 100% chance of gaining acceptance. For Gratz, race was the difference between rejection and acceptance.Two years after Jennifer Gratz was rejected from the University of Michigan undergraduate program, Barbara Grutter applied to the University Of Michigan School Of Law. Barbara Grutter had graduated from Michigan State University in 1978 with high honors and a 3.81 GPA. Even though she scored a 161 on the LSAT, Grutter postponed a Law School career to start a successful health care information firm.In 1996, at age forty-three, Grutter returned to pursue her ambitions of attending law school. Despite a life-long record of achievement, Grutter was wait-listed and eventually denied admission to the University of Michigan Law School.Like the undergraduate admissions process, the Law School used a grid system to evaluate potential candidates for admission. A white female applicant with Barbara Grutter s scores had less than a 9% chance of admission on the grid. However, under the same system, a favored minority applicant with the same scores had a 100% chance of gaining admission. As with Gratz, Grutter s race was ultimately the difference between automatic acceptance and automatic rejection.Lawsuits FiledIn 1997, CIR filed a lawsuit on behalf of Jennifer Gratz against the University of Michigan s undergraduate admission system, and a second lawsuit on behalf of Barbara Grutter against the University of Michigan Law School. Combined with CIR s recent victory in Hopwood v. Texas, these challenges made it substantially more likely that the Supreme Court would take the case.CIR argued that the University violated the Fourteenth Amendment s promise of equal protection by discriminating against Gratz and Grutter. Neither institution could profer a compelling justification for the discrimination, nor could they argue that the system of racial preferences was narrowly tailored to avoid harming students like Gratz and Grutter.In light of the ongoing lawsuits, the University of Michigan changes its admission system. The undergraduate school abandoned the grid system in favor of a points system. Under the new system, an application to the school could score a maximum of 150 points. The higher the number of points, the more likely an applicant would be admitted.The method in which points were allotted made race a decisive factor in the admission process. If the University considered an applicant an underrepresented minority, the applicant was awarded an automatic twenty points, or one-fifth of the total points needed to guarantee admission. The University did not weigh any other factors or considerations as heavily as race. The resulting method meant that an applicant with extraordinary artistic talent could only be awarded a maximum of five points for his talent, while another applicant could receive twenty points by virtue of belonging to a certain racial group.This mechanical method of assigning points based on outward characteristics alone, is a prime example of what Shelby Steele called  the disappearance of the black individual.  In his classic essay for Harper s magazine, Steele lamented that institutions, like the University of Michigan, failed to treat African Americans as individuals with real accomplishments. These institutions, Steel argued, cared more for their own image than they did for helping individual African-Americans.District Court VictoriesCIR s two cases were heard by different judges in the District Court. In Gratz, Judge Duggan ruled that the grid system under which Jennifer Gratz had been rejected was unconstitutional, but that the points system in place since then was a justified means of attaining a diverse student body.In Grutter, Judge Bernard Friedman issued a more direct and clear cut victory for CIR and Barbara Grutter. Judge Friedman held, in accordance with Hopwood v. Texas, that diversity is not a compelling government justification for discrimination. The court accordingly struck down the Law School s race-based admissions system.The University of Michigan appealed both cases, and a divided en banc panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Grutter s victory at the district court and held that the University was justified in using racial preferences to achieve diversity. The Sixth Circuit never issued a ruling in Gratz.The Supreme CourtAfter the Sixth Circuit loss in Grutter, CIR petitioned the Supreme Court, asking them to hear both cases as they presented an urgent question of constitutional law. The Court agreed and handed down decisions in June of 2003.Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court in Gratz, struck down the University of Michigan s undergraduate admissions system. Justice Rehnquist reasoned that the points system, assigning points based on outward characteristics, treated applicants in a manner that prized their race over their individual accomplishments. The failure of the University to treat applicants as individuals constituted a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.In Grutter, however, Justice Sandra Day O Connor upheld the Law School admissions system and reasoned that fostering diversity in higher education is a compelling government interest. Justice O Connor argued that a distinction could be made between the mechanical racial preferences used in the undergraduate system and the racial preferences employed by the law school. Essentially doing away with the strict scrutiny analysis that racial classifications require, Justice O Connor deferred to the law school to determine whether racial preferences are necessary. The Court did, however, limit the legality of racial preferences to a period of twenty-five years, when the government will no longer have a a compelling justification to foster diversity.Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the ruling, agreed that racial preferences would be unconstitutional in twenty-five years. However, he also argued that what is unconstitutional twenty-five years from now is also unconstitutional today. Either the Constitution forbids the use of racial discrimination or it does not.While the combined cases of Gratz and Grutter failed to end the government s use of racial preferences, it achieved the minor victory of placing limits on when and how the government may use such preferences.Gratz and Grutter are not the end of the story. CIR s client, Jennifer Gratz, was later able to end racial preferences at the University of Michigan by leading the effort to pass an amendment to the Michigan constitution that banned the use of racial preferences. When an activist group challenged the constitutionality of the amendment, CIR once again came to the aid of Jennifer Gratz. In Schuette v. Bamn, CIR successfully defended the amendment before the Supreme Court. Read more about that case here.Furthermore, almost twelve years after the Supreme Court decided Gratz and Grutter, the issue is once again back before the Supreme Court in the case Fisher v. University of Texas. CIR has filed two amicus briefs before the Supreme Court in that case that urge the Supreme Court to apply the strict scrutiny that Justice O Connor failed to apply in Grutter. In an initial opinion, Justice Kennedy agreed with CIR and ruled that even after Grutter courts may not punt on applying rigid constitutional analysis. After being remanded to the Fifth Circuit, that case is once again before the Supreme Court. Read more about CIR s ongoing efforts to challenge racial preferences in Fisher here.

REPORT: PRESIDENT TRUMP Is “Odds-On Favorite To Win Re-election” In 2020,"Liberal heads explode in 5 4 3 2 1President Trump could win the White House again in 2020   which likely would send hostile political operatives and the disapproving news media into an epic meltdown. News flash: Get ready. Mr. Trump will likely win re-election, says one analyst.  President Trump did not ascend to the White House in the usual way; he broke with traditional campaign orthodoxy and tactics,  Ford O Connell, a political analyst and adjunct professor at the George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management, tells Inside the Beltway. While Trump s first six months in the White House have been marked by early stumbles, a healthy dose of palace intrigue and low approval numbers, history says Trump is in fact the odds-on favorite to win re-election in 2020, should he choose to run. Why? Because presidential incumbency has its privileges. Since 1900, 20 presidents have sought re-election. Of those, 15 won and five lost   that is, if you include Gerald Ford, who was never elected in the first place. Adds Mr. O Connell,  So how does President Trump avoid becoming the sixth president to be fired by the people in the last 120 years? Barring some unforeseen calamity or Dwayne  The Rock  Johnson becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, the fate of Trump s presidency will live and die with the state of the economy in the fall of 2020. To ensure that the electoral winds are favorable to Trump, his administration must deliver results by passing tax reform before the 2018 midterms, showing significant progress on other key campaign promises: securing America s borders, infrastructure, trade, conservative judicial appointees. He must also continue to instill in working-class voters in both the Rust Belt (Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin) and Sun Belt (Florida, North Carolina, Arizona) battleground states the belief that he is tirelessly fighting for them. If Trump does that, voters will forgive his impetuous ways and rehire him,  the professor concludes.For entire story: Washington Times ",politics,"Aug 1, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

HOW MUSLIM IT WORKERS FOR Democrats Sold US Intel to Foreign Agents [Video],"Judge Napolitano had this to say about the DNC s Muslim IT worker:  He was arrested for some financial crime. That s the tip of the iceberg. The real crime against him was that he had contact, he had access to emails of every member of Congress and he sold what he found in there. What did he sell and to whom did he sell it. That s what the FBI wants to know. This may be a very, very serious national security investigation. We ve been reporting this scandal for months but it s just now heating up. The most of the main stream media has been silent on this serious national security breach within the DNC. The FBI is investigating who was given top secret information by the DNC IT workers who had email access to everyone in Congress!The puzzling part of this entire scandal is that the payment was outrageous! Over $4 million was given to this family and associates!THE DAILY CALLER REPORTED ON THIS BREACH OF SECURITY WAY BACK IN FEBRUARY WHEN THE BROTHERS WERE FIRED:Three brothers who managed office information technology for members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and other lawmakers were abruptly relieved of their duties on suspicion that they accessed congressional computers without permission.Brothers Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives Thursday, The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group has learned.Three members of the intelligence panel and five members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nation s most sensitive issues and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism.Also among those whose computer systems may have been compromised is Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida Democrat who was previously the target of a disastrous email hack when she served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign.The brothers are suspected of serious violations, including accessing members  computer networks without their knowledge and stealing equipment from Congress.Jamal handled IT for Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat who serves on both the intelligence and foreign affairs panels. As of 2/2, his employment with our office has been terminated,  Castro spokeswoman Erin Hatch told TheDCNF Friday.Jamal also worked for Louisiana Democrat Rep. Cedric Richmond, who is on the Committee on Homeland Security.Imran worked for Reps. Andre Carson, an Indiana Democrat, and Jackie Speier, a California Democrat. Both are members of the intelligence committee, and their spokesmen did not respond to TheDCNF s requests for comment. Imran also worked for the House office of Wasserman Schultz.Then-Rep. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, employed Abid for IT work in 2016. She was a member of House committees dealing with the armed services, oversight, and Benghazi. Duckworth was elected to the Senate in November, 2016.

"BILLIONAIRE, Leftist Author Of Harry Potter Books Apologizes For Making Up, Spreading Fake News About President Trump and Disabled Boy","Big-mouth billionaire and leftist author of the highly successful Harry Potter books, has finally taken responsibility for an awful rumor she started about President Trump and a disabled boy after the disabled boy s mother came out on Facebook to tell the truth about what really happened when President Trump met her disabled son.Author J.K. Rowling issued an apology Monday after falsely accusing President Donald Trump of refusing to shake hands with a disabled boy by sharing an edited video clip on her social media account over the weekend.The boy s mother lashed out at Rowling, saying that the Harry Potter scribe wrongly said Trump ignored and refused to shake her disabled son s hand during a recent meet-and-greet. If someone can please get a message to JK Rowling: Trump didn t snub my son & Monty wasn t even trying to shake his hand,  Ms. Kelly Weer wrote in a post on Facebook, slamming Rowling s inaccurate description of a video showing her son meeting President Trump. 1. He s 3 and hand shaking is not his thing 2. he was showing off his newly acquired secret service patch). Thanks,  Weer wrote.Rowling, a regular critic of the president, blasted Trump and claimed he  deliberately  ignored the boy, Monty Weer, who suffers from spina bifida. Trump imitated a disabled reporter. Now he pretends not to see a child in a wheelchair, as though frightened he might catch his condition,  she tweeted over the weekend. My mother used a wheelchair. I witnessed people uncomfortable around her disability, but if they had a shred of decency they got over it,  Rowling wrote on Twitter.  So, yes, that clip of Trump looking deliberately over a disabled child s head, ignoring his outstretched hand, has touched me on the raw. That man occupies the most powerful office in the free world and his daily outrages against civilised norms are having a corrosive effect,  the author continued.  How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the President. However, a White House video clearly shows President Trump bending down and graciously greeting his young fan as he approached the podium.Rowling faced intense criticism on social media, with many users urging she delete the series of tweets that included the false claims.Pictures posted on Twitter on June 26th, show Melania hosting the little disabled boy that JK Rowling accused President Trump of ignoring, during a visit to the White House in his wheelchair. It appears he also got a little extra special attention from the First Lady. Happy belated 3rd bday (yesterday) sweet Monty! Thank you for visiting us at @WhiteHouse today! pic.twitter.com/ZnENYjB7zE  Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) June 27, 2017British journalist Piers Morgan led the charge blasting Rowling   and Chelsea Clinton, who had retweeted Rowling and later apologized   for refusing to delete her tweets.Rowling finally deleted her tweets and apologized to the boy and his family for spreading false claims, but did not apologize to President Trump. A spokesperson for Rowling apparently refused to confirm to CNN s Oliver Darcy whether or not the author would apologize to Trump. Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proferred hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage,  Rowling wrote.  [M]ultiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction. I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly. These tweets will remain, but I will delete the previous ones on the subject.

REPORT: TRUMP Has Chosen His Next Communications Director…And She Will Be Perfect For The Job!,"There is chatter within the White House that Kellyanne Conway is being looked at as the next communications director, a source within the White House told The Daily Caller.Anthony Scaramucci was ousted Monday as communications director following a week of publicly feuding with former chief of staff Reince Priebus. Scaramucci called Priebus a  paranoid schizophrenic  in an interview President Trump viewed as inappropriate, according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Kellyanne Conway would be a perfect choice for President Trump s new communications director. Conway is no stranger to dealing with the press. She is also no pushover. Conway has taken on almost every liberal hack at every leftist network in America, and each time she s walked away holding her head high, as she make her points in an eloquent but no holds barred way.Chris Cuomo of fake news network CNN interviewed Kellyanne Conway on Sunday. You would have thought by now, these hacks at CNN would have figured out they are no match for the brilliant Kellyanne Conway. At the opening of his interview with Conway, Cuomo attempted to convince the few viewers who still watch CNN that President Trump was  very squishy  on his meeting with Vladimir Putin. Kellyanne Conway snapped back in her usual calm but witty way,  Chris, let s back up. So you re saying you used the word squishy which, itself, is unusual to describe the president s state of mind. So somehow that makes people on CNN insist that the president is never going to raise this with Putin? Why are they still in there?  Cuomo responded,  It s not about CNN. It s about what the president said, Kellyanne.  Kellyanne immediately landed a right hook to fake news host Chris Cuomo when she asked him,  Aren t you the least bit reluctant, if not embarrassed that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America? Watch the brilliant exchange here:Conway, currently a counselor to the president, served as Trump s campaign manager and was previously a Republican pollster. She currently is a visible face of the Trump administration through her frequent appearances on cable news and is often relied on by the White House to deliver its message to the press.

City officials city and the NYPD officers will cooperate with the feds only in immigration cases which involve  serious and violent crimes, Foul-mouthed desnudas, grabby Hulks and tourist-terrorizing gangs of Minnie Mice are still brazenly holding the Crossroads of the World hostage even amid a heavy presence of NYPD cops, who act oblivious to their disturbing antics.At any given moment on two recent afternoons, only half of the two-dozen tip-mooching characters stayed behind the blue lines of Times Square s  Designated Activity Zones,  or DAZs, the city-mandated areas created last year as their boundary for posing for photos and asking for tips.Yet none of those who illegally strayed outside the zones were issued summonses by the half-dozen police patrolling the pedestrian plaza.A law-enforcement source shrugged that the officers  hands were tied since most of the costumed panhandlers are illegal   and under the de Blasio administration, it s a no-no to go after them.The law-enforcement source added that past proposals to license the creatures went nowhere because most of the panhandlers are illegal immigrants and they wouldn t register anyway. Besides, the administration at City Hall isn t interested in going after illegals in this capacity, the source said.The most shameless of the costumed pack repeatedly left the DAZs to grab, mob and berate tourists    Take a photo lady! Mami!  shouted a trio of overly-aggressive Minnie Mice   in their frantic pursuit of cash. I told you, if you don t have a tip, then f  off!  one star-spangled desnuda, a painted nude hustler, snarled to a Post reporter, displaying just the sort of greed that detractors say is ruining Times Square s happy, family vibe.This insanity was reported by a New York Post reporter who walked Times Square and spoke with different people. If you ve ever experienced the harassment that goes on in Times Square from these beggars then you d be even more furious that these people are even walking our streets!  Thanks to the ridiculous policy from the commie mayor of NYC, the tourists and legal citizens living there have to endure this pond scum of humanity.

JOE BIDEN Called McCain Urged Him to Vote Against Obamacare Repeal,"THE OLD GUARD DEMOCRATS BROUGHT ON THE FULL COURT PRESS: Former Vice President Joe Biden personally lobbied Sen. John McCain before the senator cast the crucial vote to take down a Republican attempt to repeal the Obamacare, according to The Washington Post.The call between the two was emotional, according to the Post.

Joe Biden served in the Senate from 1972 until 2008, while McCain has been a senator since 1987 .TERM LIMITS!While Biden lobbied McCain, former President Barack Obama remained quiet on the issue as the Senate was on the verge of dismantling a core piece of his legacy.Former Sen.

NBC PUTS VIEWERS Out Of Their Misery…Cancels Disastrous MEGYN KELLY Show,"The initial run of Megyn Kelly s Sunday newsmagazine show will reportedly be taken off the air at least two episodes earlier than scheduled because of her disastrous ratings. Last week, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly set another viewership low with just 2.71 million total viewers. In the last three weeks, her show has failed to beat the years-old Dateline rerun the network ran in her show s time slot when Kelly took a week off during the Fourth of July holiday weekend.According to the New York Post,  Kelly s ratings-challenged Sunday show was announced as a limited  run that would return after the football season. The network was reportedly angling for at least ten episodes but apparently decided to end Kelly s misery after eight episodes as Kelly s downward spiral in the ratings did not stop.An NBC spinmeister claimed that Kelly s show was going off the air after this week s show because she needs to be  freed up to focus  on her morning show. Translation: Kelly needs to do all she can to not ruin NBC s crown jewel Today franchise. Network executives, who reportedly have been freaking out about Kelly s poor ratings, are probably praying that Kelly simply does no more harm than she has already done in her short time at the network.

SOCIALIST BERNIE SANDERS Can’t Explain Single Payer or Why Blue States Rejected It [Video],"Bernie Sanders should know his socialized medicine but in an exchange on Sunday he failed when he was pressed to explain why a single-payer health care system was rejected in Vermont and California, two staunchly Democratic states:CNN host Jake Tapper said that California and Vermont are  cobalt blue states  and asked how single-payer could be affordable at the national level if they rejected the system at the state level because of the expense:Single-payer failed to pass in both California and Vermont after lawmakers were unable to figure out how to fund the system. Voters in Colorado also rejected single-payer last year.Sanders pushed back against Tapper, citing  studies that he has seen,  and said that single-payer would save the average family  significant sums of money. If you look at Canada s single-payer health care system per capita, their costs are far far less than the United States,  Sanders said.   If you look at the UK, if you look at countries around the world, all of which have different approaches to a national health care system, in every instance, they are spending substantially less per capita than we pay in the United States.

HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP Can Remove Congress From Their ObamaCare Exemption [Video],"President Trump tweeted that he was considering removing bailouts and forcing Congress to pay for their health insurance at the same rates as the rest of the country. BELOW, DR. MICHAEL SIEGEL AND MICHAEL NEEDHAM (BELOW) DISCUSS HOW TRUMP CAN TAKE THE OBAMACARE EXEMPTION FROM CONGRESS:Michael Needham appeared on Fox Weekend News to discuss the possibility of President Trump removing tax-payer funded subsidies for individual members of Congress, and their staff, that allows them to avoid feeling the cost of ObamaCare.He states that this tweet could put the right pressure on Congress to come to a decision by making them  feel the full impact of the premium increases that the American people are feeling.  The American people are tired of Washington playing by different rules. In order to escape the skyrocketing premiums and other disadvantages of Obamacare, Congress defined itself as a  small business  which would entail an organization that employs fifty people or less. This then put them into the DC Small Business Exchange, allowing them to receive up to $12,000 in subsidies. He believes that it s the Senate that needs to step up to the plate since the House and POTUS have already stated their support.Read more: The Conservative Tree House",politics,"Jul 30, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
MN: Mayoral Candidate Wants To DISARM COPS After Muslim Cop Kills Unarmed Woman," Minneapolis mayoral candidate Raymond Dehn proposes disarming cops in wake of Damond shooting. Only one year ago, the FBI named Minneapolis, MN as one of the most dangerous cities in America. Minneapolis is also home to the largest Somali refugee population in America. According to the Star Tribune, Minnesota remains near the top among states for refugee resettlement, measured as a share of state population. It is also the top destination for refugees who move from the state where they were originally resettled. Of the 2,338 total, almost 45 percent hailed from Somalia.In the wake of the shooting death of Australian Justine Damond, Raymond Dehn, a candidate in the race for Minneapolis mayor has proposed disarming police officersThe Australian woman was shot dead by police officer Mohamed Noor after calling 911 to report a suspected sexual assault. Officers don t need to carry a gun on their person all the time,  said Raymond Dehn, one of the frontrunners in the mayoral race and who currently serves in the Minnesota House of Representatives. Currently, officers carry all sorts of assault weapons in their cars. So why can t one of those weapons be the side arm (such as a baton that sits on a holster)? It s important that we begin to have a conversation, and I would say that all things are on the table. We live in a culture where guns are pervasive. Cops carrying guns is part of a larger conversation about guns in our society,  he said, according to the Star Tribune .Better yet, how about just disarm the cops who, like Mohamed Noor, are only on the force to demonstrate Minneapolis  commitment to  diversity,  rather than because they re competent to be police officers?Even better still, how about hire and fire cops based on merit, rather than for their value as trophy Muslims or Somalis on the force?Nah   that would be  Islamophobic.

BREAKING NEWS: Vladimir Putin Retaliates After New Sanctions Are Slapped On Russia,"Here s a question for the anti-Trump media: If Putin and Trump have such a strong history of working together, why take such drastic actions against the US? Why doesn t Putin just pick up the phone and call his old buddy Donald Trump and get those sanctions lifted? Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that 755 US diplomats must leave the country by Sept. 1.Putin s order comes after a threat he issued on Friday about slashing US diplomatic staff in Russia and seizing two American properties in retaliation after Congress approved a vote to slap new sanctions over Moscow s interference in the 2016 presidential election.Remember when President Trump used Twitter to mock the media for suggesting Putin wanted to see Trump elected over the very weak Hillary Clinton?In other words, Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election   and why not, I want strong military & low oil prices. Witch Hunt! https://t.co/mMSxj4Su5z  Donald J.

We waited for quite some time that maybe something will change for the better, had such hope that the situation will somehow change, but judging by everything, if it changes, it will not be soon,  Putin said in a television interview with the Rossiya 1 network, according to Interfax news agency.

OOPS! MEDIA LIED…Transgender Surgery For Military Members Cost Taxpayers A LOT More Than #FakeNews Is Telling Americans,"Liz Harrington, a writer for the Washington Free Beacon  appeared on the Tucker Carlson Show to discuss the real cost of sex reassignment surgery for transgenders in the military. Harrington debunked the fake numbers the media s been peddling to the American public about the cost of the sex assignment surgeries, in an effort to discredit President Trump s decision to ban transgenders serving in the military. It turns out the media hasn t been exactly honest about actual cost of allowing transgenders to serve in our military. The media s been saying the costs are only a few million per year, but according to Harrington, the actual estimated cost is more like $1.3 billion to taxpayers over a 10 year period. Additionally, the military members who have these surgeries take an estimated 238 days off to recover.As a side note, the $1.3 billion cost to taxpayers doesn t even include the very costly hormone treatments that transgenders in the military will need following the costly surgeries.The Washington Post has done their part to mislead the American public about the cost of transgenders serving in our military. They re not interested in taking an honest look at the costs to the American taxpayer. For the media, this issue has nothing to do with the cost to American taxpayers or with our national security. It s simple a matter of political correctness. And for The Washington Post, who Americans used to rely on for actual news, political correctness trumps truth every time.The Washington Post published an article on July 26th titled that supposedly addressed the cost of transgenders in the military. Instead, the article was written and titled to reinforce a false narrative that our president is a  homophobe , a  racist  and a  misogynist .Trump s argument against transgender soldiers echoes one used against gays, women and blacksHere is a portion of their article:Seemingly out of the blue on Wednesday morning, President Trump took to Twitter to announce that he would not allow  Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.  The rationale? The military  cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. The question of costs   presumably referring to procedures like gender reassignment surgery   was addressed in a Rand report that estimated a 0.04- to 0.13-percent increase in military health-care expenditures should transgender people be allowed to serve. Trump has proposed a 10 percent bump in overall military spending, which could certainly absorb that increase.Can anyone explain why members of Congress would vote to increase spending on our military that would then be used for sex reassignment surgery for transgenders serving in our military? What in the world does sex reassignment have to do with defending our nation?

TRUMP MAKES JOKE TO COPS…The Loony Left Freaks Out Claiming “Trump Promotes Police Brutality” [Video],"President Trump made a joke while speaking to law enforcement officers that was portrayed in the media as an endorsement of police brutality The left will do just about anything to bash President Trump! Go to the 22:30 mark to hear the joke:The Daily Caller reports that while speaking about violent gang-members in a speech to law enforcement officers that focused on MS-13, Trump said officers shouldn t be  too nice  when putting violent criminals in the  paddy wagon. He added:  Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you re protecting their head, you know, the way you put the hand over. Like, don t hit their head and they ve just killed somebody, don t hit their head. I said,  You can take the hand away, OK. Trump s comment was clearly a joke and, as liberal website Slate pointed out, resembled a famous Jerry Seinfeld joke on the same topic.Journalists immediately said that the joke was an open endorsement of police brutality. TRUMP ENDORSES POLICE BRUTALITY,  blared HuffPost s front page, featuring a story titled:  Donald Trump Endorses Police Brutality In Speech To Cops. Other outlets took a similar tone.  Trump promotes police brutality in speech to cops,  reported The Daily Dot.  Trump praises police violence to audience of laughing cops,  left-wing ThinkProgress reported. Trump endorsed police brutality in a speech to law enforcement while officers laughed and cheered,  claimed Huffington Post editor Emma Gray.  In a country that already has a pretty pervasive problem with police brutality, Trump endorses their behavior,  wrote HuffPo editor Phillip Lewis.Commentator Ben Shapiro was quick to push back against claims that Trump was endorsing police brutality. This is all exaggeration. Is it appropriate for Trump to encourage police not to be  too nice  to suspects? Not really. But it s not police brutality to refrain from putting your hand on the head of a suspect to prevent them from bumping it on a car door. It s police brutality if you slam their head into the car door,  Shapiro wrote.Read mrs: Law Officer",politics,"Jul 30, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Wallace then interrupted,  Well, that s the fashionable word these days, I guess. A conservative is no longer just that, he s a libertarian. Reagan continued,  It always has been.

FARMER FINED A WHOPPING $2.8 MILLION Asks President Trump For Help,"A California farmer fined $2.8 million for plowing through vernal pools protected by the Clean Water Act without a permit is appealing to the Trump administration for help, according to California s Record Spotlight.John Duarte has sent letters to Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions seeking clarification on the federal government s case against him, the Record Spotlight reports.While the Clean Water Act protects  waters of the U.S.,  it does contain exemptions for farmers.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers fined Duarte Nursery, owned by Duarte, in 2012 for failing to get a permit before plowing through vernal pools located on a recently purchased 450 acre plot of land. The vernal pools, temporary bodies of water that house certain species of plants and animals, are protected as waters of the United States by the Clean Water Act of 1972. We expected the Trump administration to provide regulatory relief from Obama-era overreach, and we haven t seen it yet,  Duarte said according to the Record Spotlight.  We re hoping to see the administration engage this issue, to look at it again.

BURN! NYT TAKES JAB AT FOX NEWS…Watch How FOX Got Even in a Big Way! [Video],"Sometimes, the left just makes it far too easy to win.It is a well-known fact that President Trump is a big fan of FNC s  FOX & Friends,  tweeting about it often. New York Times  James Poniewozik recently ran a hit piece criticizing the show for its friendly relationship with the president, stating that  President Trump is the show s subject, its programmer, its publicist and its virtual fourth host. The stars offer him flattery, encouragement and advice. While furthering his point, Poniewozik complimented the morning show by calling it the most powerful TV show in America  due to Trump s support. Instead of getting mad, FNC got even. They purchased ads in the New Yorks Times featuring its own accidental compliment. A Fox News source confirmed that the advertisement was in direct response to the article. But the sweet revenge didn t end there.

"DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ Planned To Continue Pay For Muslim IT Aide Charged With Multiple Counts of Bank Fraud, While Living In Pakistan…Didn’t Tell Authorities Muslim Wife Left Country While Under Criminal Investigation","Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz seemingly planned to pay cyber-probe suspect and IT aide Imran Awan even while he was living in Pakistan, if the FBI hadn t stopped him from leaving the U.S. Monday. Public statements and congressional payroll records suggest she also appears to have known that his wife, a fellow IT staffer, left the country for good months ago   while she was also a criminal suspect.In all, six months of actions reveal a decision to continue paying a man who seemingly could not have been providing services to her, and who a mountain of evidence suggests was a liability. The man long had access to all of Wasserman Schultz s computer files, work emails and personal emails, and he was recently accused by a relative in court documents of wiretapping and extortion.Imran Awan is seen here with Bill Clinton in February of 2017:Imran Awan and Bill Clinton Feb '17 pic.twitter.com/ZdWJvt9H2q  archiebird (@archiebird) May 27, 2017Records also raise questions about whether the Florida Democrat permitted Awan to continue to access computers after House-wide authorities banned him from the network Feb. 2. Not only did she keep him on staff after the ban, but she also did not have any other IT person to perform necessary work that presumably would have arisen during a months-long period, according to payroll records.Wasserman Schultz employed Pakistani-born Awan and his wife Hina Alvi, and refused to fire either of them even after U.S. Capitol Police said in February 2017 that they were targets of the criminal investigation. She said police wouldn t show her evidence against the couple and, without it, she assumed they might be victims of anti-Muslim profiling.Heavy   Awan, 37, was at Dulles International Airport trying to leave the country when he was arraigned and surrendered his passport, Chad Pergram of Fox News reported. Awan was charged with bank fraud, according to Fox. The U.S. Capitol Police, FBI, and Customs and Border Protection were all involved in the arrest. According to the complain, he had bought a ticket to fly to Doha, Qatar and then Lahore, Pakistan, and had a return flight booked for January.Awan pleaded not guilty to one count of bank fraud on Tuesday, and he was ordered to turn over his passports. A hearing is scheduled for August 21 at 1:45 p.m.Awan, his wife Hina Alvi, along with several other related IT staffers had been under investigation since February, Politico reported. Officials accused them of stealing equipment from House members  offices, along with committing other possible violations. Details about the investigation were vague at first. Politico described the investigation in this way:  The employees allegedly stole equipment from members  offices without their knowledge and committed serious, potentially illegal, violations of House IT policies. In March, Fox News went into a little more detail, saying that at least five contractors, including Awan and his brothers Jamal and Abid Awan, were being investigated for possibly removing equipment from offices, including computers and servers. Fox News reported in March that the allegations included running a procurement scheme that involved buying equipment, then double-billing the House administrative office, and possibly having unauthorized access to the House computer system. Items that may have been double-billed included computers, iPads, monitors, keyboards, and routers.According to Politico, Awan earned nearly $2 million since 2004 as an IT support staffer for House Democrats. Alvi began working for House Democrats in 2007 and earned more than $1.3 million since then. Their salaries were split among multiple lawmakers  offices. None of the staffers under investigation had access to classified information, Politico reported.Awan booked a round-trip ticket to Pakistan in July and planned to depart Monday, July 24 with a return ticket in six months. He was arrested at Dulles Airport during his attempt to leave.The Associated Press reported that Awan s lawyer, Chris Gowen, said Awan  had informed the House of his plans to visit his family. Wasserman Schultz s spokesman cited Awan s Monday arrest as the reason for ending his employment on Tuesday:  Upon learning of his arrest, he was terminated. The office s insistence that his termination was prompted by the Monday arrest   and not the House Sergeant at Arms banning him and his wife from touching congressional computers or his six months in Pakistan   suggests that had he boarded the flight without incident he would still be on payroll.Awan s wife, Hina, left the country under similar circumstances March 5, after withdrawing the couple s three kids from school without telling Virginia education officials, packing up all of her possessions, and hiding $12,000 in cash, according to an FBI affidavit. She allegedly had hundreds of thousands of dollars waiting in Pakistan for her   money the FBI says Awan had obtained partly through mortgage fraud and had wired overseas using a false explanation.Two days later, on March 7, House records show Hina was cut from Wasserman Schultz s payroll.Though Hina bought a round trip ticket with a return in six months, the FBI said it  does not believe that Alvi has any intention to return to the United States. Wasserman Schultz spokesman David Darmrom did not respond to a DCNF IG request to explain why Hina had been terminated two days into a trip she claimed was temporary, while her husband had not been terminated for a six-month move. Between the part-time nature of her work and the ban, her absence was unlikely to have been noticed in two days without someone telling the office her plans.Wasserman Schultz s office also didn t answer if the office knew Hina s  round trip  was a permanent move.Hina and Awan were both IT aides whose jobs required access to the network, but the House Sergeant-At-Arms banned them from accessing it beginning Feb. 2. Awan and Hina were her only IT staffers, and payroll records through the latest available period, March 31, indicate that no other IT staffer or vendor was added to the payroll after their ban.A House source said Awan was seen in the House office building multiple times after the network ban.  Imran Awan is working in an  advisory  role for Wasserman Schultz, her spokesman said,  providing advice on technology issues. The spokesman wouldn t say who did the office s computer work after the ban, if not Awan.As IT administrators, the suspects could read all emails sent and received by the lawmaker and see all files on the staff members  computers, numerous House IT aides said. Wikileaks shows that Awan also had the password to Wasserman Schultz s iPad.In public court documents filed in Fairfax, Va., Awan s stepmother accused him of wiretapping and extortion.  Imran Awan did admit to me that my phone is tapped and there are devices installed in my house  and  Imran Awan threatened that he is very powerful and if I ever call the police again, [he] will   kidnap my family members back in Pakistan,  his stepmother, Samina Gilani, claimed in the documents (p. 21) filed April 14.Despite her professed concern of stereotyping, all other colleagues who employed Awan, Hina or their other relatives on House payrolls fired them, including Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana, who is Muslim and has criticized Wasserman Schultz for blocking police from examining a laptop tied to Imran.That laptop was found in an unused crevice of a House office building and seized as evidence by the Capitol Police, but Wasserman Schultz appeared determined to not let police see its contents, threatening  consequences  for the police chief if he didn t release it. The exchange was captured on video.

EXPERT CLAIMS N. KOREA’S SECOND MISSILE Test Demonstrates They Now Have Ability To Hit 3 Major Cities On U.S. Mainland,"When asked if a pre-emptive military strike is a possibility, as reported last week by NBC News, Trump wouldn t elaborate. I don t want to telegraph what I m doing or what I m thinking. I m not like other administrations, where they say we re going to do this in four weeks,  Trump told Fox s Ainsley Earhardt It doesn t work that way. We ll see what happens. I hope things work out well. I hope there s going to be peace, but they ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time,  he continued. You read Clinton s book. and he said,  Oh, we made such a great peace deal,  and it was a joke,  Trump said.  You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody has been outplayed.  The HillNorth Korea doesn t appear to be backing off as they continue to push forward with the testing of their intercontinental ballistic missiles. They called the launching of their second flight test yesterday, a  stern warning  to the United States. David Wright, a physicist and co-director of the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that if reports of the missile s maximum altitude and flight time are correct, it would have a theoretical range of at least 10,400 kilometers (about 6,500 miles). That means it could have reached Los Angeles, Denver or Chicago, depending on variables such as the size and weight of the warhead that would be carried atop such a missile in an actual attack.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Saturday the second flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile demonstrated his country can hit the U.S. mainland, hours after the launch left analysts concluding that a wide swath of the United States, including Los Angeles and Chicago, is now in range of North Korean weapons.The Korean Central News Agency said that Kim expressed  great satisfaction  after the Hwasong-14 missile reached a maximum height of 3,725 kilometers (2,314 miles) and traveled 998 kilometers (620 miles) before accurately landing in waters off Japan. The agency said that the test was aimed at confirming the maximum range and other technical aspects of the missile it says was capable of delivering a  large-sized, heavy nuclear warhead. Analysts had estimated that the North s first ICBM on July 4 could have reached Alaska, and said that the latest missile appeared to extend that range significantly.Immediately after the launch, U.S. and South Korean forces conducted live-fire exercises. South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo called for the deployment of strategic U.S. military assets   which usually means stealth bombers and aircraft carriers   as well as additional launchers of an advanced U.S. anti-missile system.Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the missile, launched late Friday night, flew for about 45 minutes   about five minutes longer than the first. The missile was launched on very high trajectory, which limited the distance it traveled, and landed west of Japan s island of Hokkaido.The KCNA quoted Kim as saying that the launch reaffirmed the reliability of the country s ICBM system and an ability to fire at  random regions and locations at random times  with the  entire  U.S. mainland now within range. The agency said that the test confirmed important features of the missile system, such as the proper separation of the warhead and controlling its movement and detonation after atmospheric re-entry.Kim said the launch sent a  serious warning  to the United States, which has been  meaninglessly blowing its trumpet  with threats of war and stronger sanctions, the KCNA said.President Donald Trump issued a statement condemning the missile test as a threat to the world, and rejecting North Korea s claim that nuclear weapons ensure its security.  In reality, they have the opposite effect,  he said.Trump said the weapons and tests  further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people.  He vowed to  take all necessary steps  to ensure the security of the U.S. and its allies.ABC News   On July 4th, 2917, A U.S. official confirmed that North Korea launched a two-stage intercontinental ballistic missile. It was the first successfully test-fired ICBM for North Korea, which has been attempting to build a missile that can reach the U.S. mainland.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in March that  all options are on the table  to deal with the escalating threat North Korea poses.The Department of Defense has an extensive missile defense system designed to help protect against a missile attack from that country.In May the U.S. conducted the ground-based intercept system s first test against an ICBM-class target. The interceptor was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and the ICBM target was launched from Kwajalein Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. The result: The ICBM was intercepted, which was likened to firing a bullet and hitting another bullet. This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,  said Vice Adm. Jim Syring, the director of the Missile Defense Agency at the time.There are 36 ground-based interceptors at two military bases in the U.S.   32 at Fort Greely in Alaska and four at Vandenberg.Watch:Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said he told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call that the second missile test greatly increased the threat from Pyongyang. He said two sides agreed to consider all means necessary to exert the utmost pressure on North Korea. They reiterated calls for new sanctions and to work closely together with South Korea along with efforts by China and Russia.China, meanwhile, urged its ally North Korea to abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions and halt any moves that could escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula.Washington and its allies have watched with growing concern as Pyongyang has made significant progress toward its goal of having all of the U.S. within range of its missiles to counter what it labels as U.S. aggression. There are other hurdles, including building nuclear warheads to fit on those missiles and ensuring reliability. But many analysts have been surprised by how quickly leader Kim Jong Un has developed North Korea s nuclear and missile programs despite several rounds of U.N. Security Council sanctions that have squeezed the impoverished country s economy.Trump has said he will not allow North Korea to obtain an ICBM that can deliver a nuclear warhead. But this week, the Defense Intelligence Agency reportedly concluded that the North will have a reliable ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear weapon as early as next year, in an assessment that trimmed two years from the agency s earlier estimate.

PICTURE OF Cop Walking Son To School On Day He Was Murdered Appears On Social Media Same Day MEDIA TRASHED TRUMP Over Joke He Made To Cops About Getting Tough On Criminals Who Kill Innocent People,"So what s worse, Barack Obama remaining silent about the slaughter of innocent cops, while meeting behind closed doors in the White House with Black Lives Matter leaders advocating for violence against innocent cops, or President Trump making a joke about cops being tougher on criminals who kill innocent people? Does anyone remember Al Sharpton leading a hateful chant:  What do we want? Dead cops! When do we want it? Now!  in a pro-violence against cops rally in the city of New York? Does anyone remember then President Barack Obama denouncing this hateful rhetoric against innocent law enforcement officers?Shortly after these protests, 2 New York City cops were killed in cold blood by a black lives matter supporter. Donald Trump, who was not yet a candidate for president, spoke out on the culpability of Al Sharpton, who is a close friend of former President Barack Obama for the murders of these innocent cops:President Trump didn t make any secret of the fact that he was pro-police while he was running for office. He also didn t make any secret of the fact that he believed Al Sharpton was doing what he was doing to racially divide our nation.President Trump made a joke while speaking to law enforcement officers that was portrayed in the media as an endorsement of police brutality.Meanwhile, the heartbreaking picture of slain Indiana cop Lt. Aaron Allen walking his young son to the bus on the day he was murdered by one of the  victims in a car crash he was responding to, has appeared on several social media sited. You will be hard pressed to find it in the media however, because it doesn t fit their liberal, anti-cop narrative.This is a photo of Lt. Aaron Allen walking his son to the bus stop hours before he was killed in the line of duty. Teared up looking at this pic.twitter.com/tJRNEaTWjJ  Ryan Fournier (@RyanAFournier) July 29, 2017Daily Caller   While speaking about violent gang-members in a speech to law enforcement officers that focused on MS-13, Trump said officers shouldn t be  too nice  when putting violent criminals in the  paddy wagon. He added:  Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you re protecting their head, you know, the way you put the hand over. Like, don t hit their head and they ve just killed somebody, don t hit their head. I said,  You can take the hand away, OK. Trump s comment was clearly a joke and, as liberal website Slate pointed out, resembled a famous Jerry Seinfeld joke on the same topic.Liberal journalists said the joke was an open endorsement of police brutality.Here s the clip of Trump making a joke to the law enforcement officers:President urges officers to commit acts of brutality, officers laugh and cheer wildly. Beginning to think problem isn't a few bad apples. pic.twitter.com/o1sSgw6lGy  Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) July 28, 2017 TRUMP ENDORSES POLICE BRUTALITY,  blared HuffPost s front page, featuring a story titled:  Donald Trump Endorses Police Brutality In Speech To Cops. Other outlets took a similar tone.  Trump promotes police brutality in speech to cops,  reported The Daily Dot.  Trump praises police violence to audience of laughing cops,  left-wing ThinkProgress reported. Trump endorsed police brutality in a speech to law enforcement while officers laughed and cheered,  claimed Huffington Post editor Emma Gray.  In a country that already has a pretty pervasive problem with police brutality, Trump endorses their behavior,  wrote HuffPo editor Phillip Lewis. Trump just called for cops to rough up suspects more in front of a crowd of cops, they cheered,  claimed Daily Beast writer Colin Jones. President Trump is openly and explicitly calling for, to wild applause just moments ago, cops to commit more police brutality,  claimed Daily Beast writer Asawin Suebsaeng. This is vile, and shame on every officer who cheered and whooped,  said liberal MSNBC host Chris Hayes. MSNBC producer Kyle Griffin claimed the video showed Trump suggesting that  it s OK for police to rough up the people that they arrest. President Trump spent his Friday afternoon publicly praising police brutality,  claimed left-wing news outlet NowThis.Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro was quick to push back against claims that Trump was endorsing police brutality. This is all exaggeration. Is it appropriate for Trump to encourage police not to be  too nice  to suspects? Not really. But it s not police brutality to refrain from putting your hand on the head of a suspect to prevent them from bumping it on a car door. It s police brutality if you slam their head into the car door,  Shapiro wrote.

BUSTED! H.R. McMaster Caught Communicating Internal White House Info with Deep State’s McCabe,"Sara Carter of Circa News is a very trusted source who goes deep like no other journalist we know. Carter is reporting that National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster has been communicating White House internal information to Deep State Acting FBI Director Andy McCabe.Investigating: sources say, McMaster has been communicating WH internal politics 2 Acting FBI director Andy McCabe.  More shake-ups?  Sara A. Carter (@SaraCarterDC) July 28, 2017We ve written extensively on McCabe who was in hot water for doing unscrupulous things (see below) during his wife s campaign. His loyalty to Trump has been called into question numerous times. The timing is interesting because Judicial Watch just filed three lawsuits for info on McCabe.Investigative reporter Mike Cernovich has been reporting for months that McMaster is on the globalist s agenda and secretly working against President Trump s  America First  plans. It has also been previously reported that Comey s replacement as Acting FBI Head, Andrew McCabe, has ties to the Hillary Clinton campaign.McCabe is also being investigated by the Office of U.S. Counsel violating the Hatch Act which prohibits FBI agents from campaigning in partisan races. Concerns arose when different media outlets found that a political action committee affiliated with Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe (who has ties to Bill and Hilary Clinton) contributed almost $500,000 to the 2015 Virginia State Senate campaign of McCabe s wife, Jill McCabe. She also received $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is connected to McAuliffe, a Democrat.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE FBI S MCCABE BEING UNDER INVESTIGATION:Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is being investigated by the Office of U.S. Counsel violating the Hatch Act according to a new report by Circa News.The Hatch Act prohibits FBI agents from campaigning in partisan races. Photos of McCabe campaigning for his wife raised questions about McCabe s compliance with the law.Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is being investigated by the Office of U.S. Special Counsel for violating The Hatch Act that prohibits FBI agents from campaigning in partisan races.The Office of U.S. Special Counsel, the government s main whistleblower agency, is investigating whether FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe s activities supporting his wife Jill s Democratic campaign for Virginia state senate in 2015 violated the Hatch Act s prohibition against FBI agents campaigning in partisan races. I am voting for Jill because she is the best wife ever,  McCabe put on a sign that he photographed himself holding. The photo was posted on her social media page a few days before the election, in response to Dr. Jill McCabe s plea to  help me win  by posting photos expressing reasons why voters should vote for her, according to the complaint.Other social media photos in the complaint showed McCabe s minor daughter campaigning with her mother, wearing an FBI shirt, and McCabe voting with his wife at a polling station.Here is another social media photo of our acting #FBI director, #AndrewMcCabe breaking the rules by campaigning on social media. #Corrupt pic.twitter.com/hBCH29yErY  Senator Dick Black (@SenRichardBlack) May 9, 2017The Hatch Act prohibits FBI employees from engaging  in political activity in concert with a political party, a candidate for partisan political office, or a partisan political group.

An ethics expert told Circa the photos raised legitimate questions about McCabe s compliance with the law.Meanwhile, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe s office released to Circa under the Freedom of Information Act documents showing McCabe attended a meeting with his wife and the governor on a Saturday in March 2015 specifically to discuss having Jill McCabe run for state Senate in Virginia as a Democrat.

SCARAMUCCI’S WIFE FILES FOR DIVORCE…Why She’s Blaming Trump,"When was the last time being loyal to your boss was a negative, especially when your boss is the POTUS!The White House s new communications director Anthony Scaramucci is being divorced by his wife Deirdre Ball after three years of marriage because of his ruthless mission to get close to President Donald Trump, whom she despises. A source says that while  she liked the nice Wall Street life and their home on Long Island  she did not care for the  insane world of D.C.  and she is tired of his  naked ambition. Another source said the former couple had fought over his loyalty to Trump. The source noted,  Deidre is not a fan of Trump, and she hasn t exactly been on board and supportive of Anthony and his push to get back into the White House. According to reports, Ball donated $5,400 to the congressional campaign of anti-Trump Democrat Kathleen Rice in 2015. But she also donated $10,800 to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker s presidential campaign and $2,700 to Jeb Bush s campaign the same year.Deidre worked as a vice president in investor relations for SkyBridge Capital, the firm Scaramucci founded in 2005 and sold to ascend to the White House. The source said that Scaramucci had been  hell-bent  on claiming his position at the White House after he was originally pegged for a senior role. This ambition was halted by Reince Priebus, Trump s chief of staff. But, after an aggressive campaign, Scaramucci was made communications director by Trump which prompted Sean Spicer to quit.Scaramucci recently gave an incredibly strange interview with the New Yorker, telling reporter Ryan Lizza that he thought Priebus was a  f king paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.  He then added,  I m not Steve Bannon, I am not trying to suck my own c k. He was also noted saying,  I m not trying to build my own brand off the f king strength of the president. I am here to serve the country. Ball went by the Twitter handle @MrsAScaramucci but, according to reports, she deleted her account after her husband was appointed as White House communications director. A friend close to Scaramucci stated that  Anthony is focusing on his children, his work for the president and the American people. There is nothing more important to him. I don t know who Deidre thought she was marrying but anyone who knows Anthony knows he s an ambitious man.

BREAKING NEWS: REINCE PRIEBUS GONE! Trump Tweets Replacement,"Establishment Republican Reince Priebus is gone The establishment Republican so many have blamed for White House leaks or ties to White House leakers met his fate today. After only 6 months as President Trump s White House Chief of Staff, Trump went around the media and announced on Twitter he was being replace with General John F. Kelly:I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017 and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017Mr. Priebus, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, lost his job just hours after the president s signature drive to repeal his predecessor s health care program collapsed on the Senate floor and a day after an ugly feud with the new communications director erupted in a public airing of the deep animosities plaguing the White House.The announcement capped a fraught 24 hours in which the president s advisers waited for a change they had long anticipated. Mr. Priebus accompanied Mr. Trump on Air Force One for a day trip to Long Island as his fate was being decided. Making for a tense flight, his rival, Anthony Scaramucci, the communications director who had publicly vowed to force Mr. Priebus s resignation, was also on the plane and in the motorcade.Was Priebus the leaker? According to a report by Mediaite,  Fox s The Five host and friend to the president, Kimberly Guilfoyle told President Trump on Wednesday night he was Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle appears to have echoed Anthony Scaramucci s sentiments on Reince Priebus to President Donald Trump during a Wednesday night dinner at the White House, only without the profanity.The Five co-host was invited, along with her colleague Sean Hannity and former Fox News Executive Bill Shine, to the White House Wednesday night to dine with the president. And a report from The New York Times alleges that Guilfoyle told Trump that his Chief of Staff was  a problem  and  a leaker  during that dinner. According to an anonymous source who was briefed on their conversation, Guilfoyle also told the president that Priebus was  someone who was not serving his agenda. On Thursday night, Guilfoyle confirmed to her co-hosts on The Five that she did have dinner with the president. And while she refrained from going into detail about her conversations with Trump, she claimed that he was in a  very, very good mood  and was  enthused  about his agenda going forward.Guilfoyle didn t go after Priebus on-air, but she did say that  something needs to be done  regarding to the numerous White House shakeups.  MediaiteIn barely half a year on the job, Mr. Priebus never won the full confidence of the president nor was granted the authority to impose a working organizational structure on the West Wing. Always seeming to be on the edge of ouster, Mr. Priebus saw his fate finally sealed a week ago when Mr. Trump hired Mr. Scaramucci, an edgy Wall Street financier, over the chief of staff s objections. Mr. Priebus s ally, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, resigned in protest.

SHOCKING TESTIMONY Confirms Comey Used Fake Russian “Golden Showers” Dossier to Target Trump [Video],"During congressional testimony, the CEO of Hermitage Capital was speaking about the  Foreign Agents Registration Act  (FARA). During the testimony the origin of the Fusion GPS  Russian Dossier  was discussed (please see our previous report on this below). The Hermitage Capital CEO revealed that the Russian government actually paid Fusion GPS to create the fake  Golden Shower  propaganda dossier on candidate Trump. Here s the kicker: That same dossier was used by the FBI in June/July 2016 to generate the FISA surveillance warrants against the Trump campaign.Yes, that means FBI Director Comey used the fake dossier  commissioned by Russia to attack Trump, as the framework to launch his FBI investigation into candidate Donald Trump and Russian collusion.Soooo why is Mueller still investigating President Trump?Entire video of Testimony Below:Graham s questioning begins at the 48:40 point:Foreign Agent Registration Requirements William Bowder, a Russian market investor, testifies at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on foreign agent registration requirements, as well as what he knows about Natalia Veslnitskaya, a Russian attorney who met with Donald Trump, Jr. in 2016. OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE DOSSIER:EXTRAORDINARY DETAILS EMERGE About How Senator John McCain Got  Dirty Dossier  On President Trump From Ex-Spy Where s The Media Outrage?Where was the media s outrage when a sitting United States senator, John McCain went on a wild goose chase, that led him overseas, in an effort to obtain what he believed was incriminating evidence that could be used to harm President Trump? How is it okay for Senator John McCain to actively seek dirt on a sitting president, but not okay for Donald Trump Jr. (who is NOT a government official) to meet with a Russian lawyer in an attempt to discover potential dirt on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton?Sen. John McCain commented on Tuesday about Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with the Russian lawyer. How serious do you think this particular shoe is?  Raju asked, referring to Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya after being promised dirt on Clinton that was reportedly part of a Russian government effort. I don t know. But it s certainly another shoe that s dropped that needs to be pursued and looked at,  McCain said.  TPMWatch RINO Senator John McCain express his concern overt the seriousness of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with the Russian lawyer about the lifting US sanctions on Russian adoption. It s curious that the reporter never asked McCain about his efforts to smear our president with a unsubstantiated dirty dossier from an ex-spy:Before we go any further into the messy details of John McCain s international dealings to find dirt on our sitting president, it s worth mentioning that as far as we know, no one was murdered as a result of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who entered the US without a visa under  extraordinary circumstances  thanks to the efforts of Barack Obama s DOJ. The same cannot be said about McCain s dealings with the  dirty dossier  on Trump. Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya is also said to have ties to Fusion GPS, the sketchy secretive Washington firm that commissioned the dubious intelligence dossier on Donald Trump.According to the Daily Caller   The Russian lawyer who offered Donald Trump Jr. damaging information about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reportedly has ties to the opposition research firm that commissioned the dossier on President Donald Trump.When the June 2016 meeting took place, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was in New York to defend Prevezon, a Russian holding firm accused of laundering money for corrupt Russian businessmen. Veselnitskaya had been working on the case for years with assistance from Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that compiled the Trump dossier.Fusion GPS denied any knowledge of, or role in, facilitating the meeting between Veselnitskaya and Trump Jr.According to The Sun: A FORMER KGB spy chief suspected of helping Brit spook Christopher Steele compile the Trump  dirty dossier  has been found dead in his car under mysterious circumstances.Oleg Erovinkin, described as a key source behind the widely discredited document, was found dead in the back of his car in Moscow on Boxing Day.Today, the Daily Mail reports: Sen. John McCain said he did  what any citizen would do  in turning over the dirty dossier, which contained unconfirmed secrets about the president-elect, over to the FBI.The Guardian charted the path of how the dossier came to be and how it was that McCain got his hands on the controversial documents.In turn, that firm outsourced the research to a  retired western European former counter-intelligence official, with a long history of dealing with the shadow world of Moscow s spooks and siloviki (securocrats),  explained the Guardian.Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal identified the ex-spy as Christopher Steele.The Guardian pointed out that just because a Democrat was willing to pay for the information that didn t mean that said Democrat was Hillary Clinton s campaign or the Democratic National Committee.Sometimes donors seek out this information in order to ensure they ve made a sound investment.***Yeah okay!***The contractor, who the Guardian didn t name, but the Wall Street Journal identified as Steele, reportedly found the information that he dug up to be concerning. He and another ex-British diplomat, Christopher Burrows, run their own company, Orbis Business Intelligence. If the allegations were real, their implications were overwhelming,  the Guardian wrote.On November 18, at the Halifax International Security Forum, McCain was introduced to a  former senior western diplomat  who had set eyes on the documents and knew who put them together, telling the Arizona Republican that the individual was  highly reliable. That man can now be named as Sir Andrew Wood, British ambassador to Moscow from 1995 to 2000.Wood told the Independent that he had met McCain, spoken to him about Trump, and about the potential for him to be compromised.In a carefully nuanced statement he said:  Yes I did meet Senator McCain and his aides at the conference. We spoke about the kind of activities the Russians can be engaged in. We also spoke about how Mr Trump may find himself in a position where there could be an attempt to blackmail him with Kompromat [a Russian term for compromising material] and claims that there were audio and video tapes in existence.   He added:  I would like to stress that I did not pass on any dossier to Senator McCain or anyone else and I did not see a dossier at the time. I do know Christopher Steele and in my view he is very professional and thorough in what he does. He did not however address whether he told McCain there was a dossier   and how to get it.Clearly, somebody did.From there, McCain dispatched a  trusted emissary  who flew across the Atlantic to meet the source of the documents at an airport that the Guardian did not name.The aide was instructed to look for a man with a copy of the Financial Times and that s how the individuals met, with the source taking McCain s emissary back to his house and giving the American a copy of the documents.Within 24 hours, the dossier was in Washington, though the contents of the file couldn t be verified without an investigation.  McCain, the Guardian said, was worried that his actions might be interpreted as revenge for some of the controversial comments Trump made about him   such as knocking the fact that the longtime senator had been a prisoner of war.However, McCain decided to hand over the documents to FBI Director James Comey on December 9. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI,  McCain said Wednesday in a statement about that matter. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue,  McCain said.For entire story: Daily MailRead more: CT",politics,"Jul 28, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
OOPS! VIDEO Shows Senator McCain Saying He’ll Fight To REPEAL and REPLACE Obamacare Only 9 Months Ago: “We have to scrap it entirely and start over”,"In spite of Senator John McCain s promise to his constituents only 9 months ago when he was running for reelection, that he would fight to repeal and replace Obamacare, McCain voted late last night with two other liberal Republican senators, and every Democrat senator to keep Obamacare intact.But that s not what Senator McCain promised Arizona voters he would do only 9 months ago On October 10, 2016, John McCain faced off against his Democrat opponent Congresswoman Kirkpatrick in a televised debate. At the center of the debate was the disastrous Obamacare and what could be done to fix it. McCain responded: For the first time in history, a major entitlement reform was rammed through the Congress of the United States without a single vote from the other side. I fought for weeks, and weeks, and weeks against Obamacare and they would not allow us an amendment. There was not a single amendment allowed. No input from the minority party. We were the minority party. Now Congresswoman Kirkpatrick wants us to sit down and work together. Here s how we work together, we repeal and we replace it. McCain went on to argue that the majority of the American people have  resoundingly rejected Obamacare. One of the debate moderators asked McCain if it was possible for Congress to try to improve Obamacare rather than to try to repeal it. McCain rejected the idea that it could be fixed and that the only solution is to repeal Obamacare:  We have to scrap it entirely and start over.  McCain went on to explain why Congress MUST repeal Obamacare,  It s a scam and the problem is, that the cost is becoming prohibitive and we ve got to change it and fix it. Watch Senator John McCain as he arrogantly throws his thumb down in defiance of his own party and joins two of the most liberal Republicans in the Senate to thumb their noses at President Trump, as they jump across the aisle to join their friends who shut them out of the first Obamacare vote.",politics,"Jul 28, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
WATCH: SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS Mocks Media For Ignoring Public Testimony Proving Fake Russian Dossier Was Part Of “Witch Hunt or Hoax”,"Sarah Huckabee Sanders has taken control of the media and is no longer allowing them to push a false narrative when it comes to President Trump and a non-existant Russian connection.Time and time again, Sanders has proven she s no pushover when it comes to the rabid leftist media who would love nothing more than to be able to sabotage her during her press briefings. Yesterday was no exception. With a smile on her face, Sanders called out the media for ignoring the biggest story of the day.  The one day there might have been a question on Russia, there wasn t. Often, we have a lot of uh, media with  Russia first , and uh, but today, there was public testimony that further discredited the phony dossier that s been the source of so much of the fake news and conspiracy theories. And we learned that the firm that produced it was also being paid by the Russians. This is yet the latest piece of evidence that vindicates what the president has said that this is just a  witch hunt  and a  hoax . And its a shame that the president and the country have had to go through this charade. The entire Russia hoax implodes just as the scandal of the year (the Awan brothers) breaks.

UNREAL! THREE REPUBLICAN SENATORS Kill Republican Healthcare Bill in Midnight Vote [Video],"It s clear that some Republicans never wanted Obamacare to die Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John McCain of Arizona killed the Republican  skinny  bill in a 49-51 vote. McCain could be seen walking into the room with a thumbs down to case his vote. You could hear shocked reaction in the room Sen. John McCain votes NO to defeat Obamacare: John McCain says he voted to reject a so-called skinny repeal healthcare bill in the Senate because it would not accomplish the goal of effectively replacing Obamacare. Issuing a statement the senator said he dramatically voted  no  in the small hours of Friday morning because he did not believe in forcing through the changes without at least some Democrat support.John McCain statement in full explaining, why he killed Donald Trump s skinn  healthcare repeal bill From the beginning, I have believed that Obamacare should be repealed, and replaced with a solution that increases competition, lowers costs and improves care for the American people. The so-called skinny repeal amendment the Senate voted on today, would not accomplish those goals. While the amendment would have repealed some of Obamacare s most burdensome regulations, it offered no replacement to actually reform our health care system and deliver affordable, quality health care to our citizens. The Speaker s statement that, the House would be willing to go to conference does not ease my concern, that this shell of a bill could be taken up and passed at any time. I ve stated time and time again that one of the major failures of Obamacare was that, it was rammed through Congress by Democrats, on a strict-party line basis without a single Republican vote. We should not make the mistakes of the past, that has led to Obamacare s collapse, including in my home state of Arizona where premiums are skyrocketing, and health care providers are fleeing the marketplace.  We must now return to the correct way of legislating, and send the bill back to committee, hold hearings, receive input from both sides of aisle, heed the recommendations of nation s governors, and produce a bill that finally delivers affordable health care for the American people. We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve. The defeat of the healthcare reforms dealt a serious blow to Donald Trump s reform agenda. Senate Republicans made clear that, unable to even pass the skinny version of their repeal bill, any kind of healthcare reform might prove impossible. This is clearly a disappointing moment, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.  I regret that our efforts were not enough, this time. It s time to move on,  he said. Mr McConnell put the health bill on hold and announced that, the Senate would move onto other legislation next week.Mr Trump responded on Twitter:  3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let Obama Care implode, then deal. Watch!

LT COL TONY SHAFFER: Muslim DNC IT Staffers Sent Sensitive Info to Muslim Brotherhood [VIDEO],"Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer opened a can of worms tonight when he said that the Awan brothers sent sensitive intel to the Muslim Brotherhood As if this case couldn t get more bizarre!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlqiLJVM-soOUR PREVIOUS UPDATE ON THIS BIZARRE CASE: Dem Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz Pakistani IT staffer Imran Awan was arrested at Dulles airport while trying to flee the United States. Get the back story from Maria Bartiromo:  How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one? They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old one of the guys, the other was 25. They re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background! If you haven t been following this crazy series of events, we ve got a previous report below to fill you in. Basically, Imran Awan and three Muslim relatives were hired to handle IT for the DNC which gave them access to lots of sensitive information NOT GOOD! The Daily Caller just exclusively reported that Awan attempted to destroy hard drives then desperately tried to retrieve them when they were discovered.GETTING THOSE DESTROYED HARD RIVES BACK:Pakistani-born Imran Awan, long-time right-hand IT aide to the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairwoman, has since desperately tried to get the hard drives back, the individual told The Daily Caller News Foundation s Investigative Group.A high-level congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the probe, confirmed that the FBI has joined what Politico previously described as a Capitol Police criminal probe into  serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network  by Imran and three of his relatives, who had access to the emails and files of the more than two dozen House Democrats who employed them on a part-time basis.Capitol Police have also seized computer equipment tied to the Florida lawmaker.Awan s younger brothers, Abid and Jamal, his wife, Hina Alvi, and Rao Abbas, Imran s best friend, are also under investigation. There have been no arrests in the case.THIS CASE IS HUGE! MARIA BARTIROMO IS LIVID ABOUT IT:A Pakistani family under criminal investigation by the U.S. Capitol Police (see our previous report below) for abusing their access to the House of Representatives information technology (IT) system may have engaged in myriad other questionable schemes besides allegedly placing  ghost employees  on the congressional payroll.Imran Awan, his wife Hina, and brothers Abid and Jamal collectively netted more than $4 million in salary as IT administrators for House Democrats between 2009 and 2017. Yet the absence of signs of wealth displayed among them raise questions such as was the money sent overseas or did something other than paychecks motivate their actions?Capitol Police revoked the Awans  access to the congressional IT system in February 2017 after a major data breach was detected. Their access had allowed them to read emails and files of dozens of members, including many serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS   THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS IGNORING THE CRIMINALITY OF THESE BROTHERS:3 MUSLIM BROTHERS Working For Dems In Congress CAUGHT Accessing Unauthorized Top-Secret Government Intel One Has Criminal Background May Have Ties To Muslim Brotherhood [VIDEO]3 Congressional IT employees have been fired for accessing members computer networks without permission. Maria s on the show, knows more about this. Can you fill me in a bit.Here are their names Stuart. let me tell you what the 3 people that were fired on Thursday: Abid, Imran and Jamal Awan. They were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people s computer networks unauthorized. At a minimum they were fired. At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence, foreign affairs and intelligence committees.  Okay? So they were getting very important information, government information. They accessed these computers. That is the least of it. There s also some talk that people are looking into what ties they have into terrorism. Are they impacted by the Muslim Brotherhood? Are they a part of the Muslim Brotherhood? One of them has a criminal background!How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one? They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old one of the guys, the other was 25. They re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background! I hear what you re saying, I mean, these intelligence committees handle our terror strategies right? They got in on Benghazi by the way.Yes, and they also worked for many Democrats in the House. They are thinking that they may be also one of the reasons Debbie Wasserman Schultz got hacked. There s so much more to come on this Stuart, it s an incredible story. I think it s amazing!Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Their salaries and time were shared among dozens of Democratic members, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Despite the generous salaries, the four were involved in multiple suspicious mortgage transfers and a debt-evading bankruptcy. Abid had more than $1 million in debts following a failed business called Cars International that he ran in Falls Church, Va., from November 2009 to September 2010. Business associates said in court documents that Abid had stolen money and vehicles from them.It s unclear how Abid found time to run an automotive business while working full-time for Congress. He had been on the congressional payroll since 2005. A congressional credit union repossessed two of his personal cars before the business folded.Abid filed for bankruptcy in 2012, but somehow managed to keep ownership of two houses while telling the bankruptcy court and creditors that he had no assets with which to pay them. He signed a sworn statement that he and his wife, Natalia Soba, were living apart and needed separate residences. My spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purpose of evading the requirements of   707(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code,  Abid claimed in bankruptcy documents. But both houses had been in the family for years.Abid s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.A spokesman for Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas told TheDCNF Friday that Jamal s  employment with our office has been terminated. Hilarie Chambers, a spokeswoman for Rep. Sandy Levin   who employed Abid   told TheDCNF that  after being notified by the House Administration Committee, this individual was removed from our payroll. We are confident that everything in our office is secure. Not every Democrat is willing to terminate their connection with these four:Some Democrats have not terminated their connection with the four, including Wasserman Schultz, who employs Imran and who resigned from her DNC post last year after a computer hack revealed embarassing emails. Derrick Robinson, spokesman for California Rep. Karen Bass, refused to comment on Alvi s employment status.For entire story: Daily Caller",politics,"Jul 28, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
MEDALS OF VALOR: President Trump Honored Agents and Officers Who Took Down Gunman at GOP Baseball Practice Shooting [Video],"It s great to have a president who appreciates our special agents and police officers! Trump honored the police officers and special agents who took down the lunatic who shot Steve Scalise last month during a baseball practice for a charity game:Remember the horrible day that the lunatic opened fire trying to kill Republicans?Here s our report on the shooting:Rep. Steve Scalise was shot Wednesday morning in Alexandria, Virginia, in a  deliberate attack.  A congressional staffer was also shot. Scalise is in surgery right now and is expected to recover.Rand Paul said Scalise being there likely saved everyone because his presence meant Capitol Police were there.Scalise, a member of the House Republican leadership as the majority whip, appeared to have been shot in the hip and it appeared two Capitol Hill police agents were shot, according to Rep. Mo Brooks who was on deck when the shooting occurred. The shooting took place at a practice for the GOP congressional baseball team.NBC News Special Report: Congressman Scalise, aides shot at baseball practice in Virginia https://t.co/KD9i1iP9MZ  Jason Calabretta (@JasonCalabretta) June 14, 2017In a statement, Texas Rep. Roger Williams, one of the team s coaches, said one of his staff members was shot during the incident and is receiving medical attention. There was no information on the staffer s injuries.According to both congressional and law enforcement sources, the shooting appears to be a  deliberate attack. Two law enforcement sources say the suspect  is in police custody, has been taken to a hospital.Lawmakers who spoke at the scene to reporters described a normal morning practice, at a field where they ve practiced for years, when all of a sudden shots rang out. Lawmakers, staff members and even the young son of one of the members ran for cover, jumping into dugouts and over fences to avoid the gunshots.Congressmen in attendance described  an injured Scalise dragging himself roughly 15 yards away from second base and lying there until the shooter was shot. The Congressmen then ran to help him. Once they were able, Sen. Jeff Flake said he and Rep. Brad Wenstrup, who is a physician, went out to where Scalise was lying to apply pressure to the wound. Nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill police. It would have been a massacre without them.  -Rand Paul  We had nothing but baseball bats to fight back against a rifle with.    Congressman Mo BrooksArizona Sen. Jeff Flake added that he saw a member of Scalise s security detail return fire on the gunman for what felt like 10 minutes, even though the police officer was wounded in the leg.  50 shots would be an understatement, I m quite sure,  Flake said when asked about the total amount of gunfire, including police returning fire. Flake said two members of Scalise s security detail were wounded, and another man was wounded in the chest. Brooks said the shooter appeared to be a white male but added that  I saw him for a second or two.  He said the shooter was behind the third base dugout and didn t say anything.  The gun was a semiautomatic,  Brooks said, adding that he was sure it was a rifle but unsure what kind.  It continued to fire at different people.

America needs a wall at our southern border and the House just passed a spending measure that funds a portion of Trump s wall!The House passed a spending measure Thursday that includes funding for a portion of President Donald Trump s border wall with a vote largely along party lines.The funding was included as a part of a  minibus,  which packaged together four appropriations bills aimed at funding the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Energy, water projects and the legislative branch. The lower chamber opted to group the  must-pass  appropriations measures together due to leadership s lack of votes to pass an all-encompassing omnibus.Building the structure has been a top priority for the president, who placed a strong emphasis on the proposal during the course of the campaign.Democrats have met the border wall proposal with strong opposition, feeling that the project will be expensive and ineffective.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"Jul 27, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

MUSLIM TEENS ATTACK CROWD for Being White “Non Muslims”: “Why aren’t you a Muslim?”,"The trend of young Muslim men targeting and attacking white non-Muslims continues world wide. A group of three Muslim men attacked strangers at the Liverpool city center because they were white  non-Muslims.  One witness feared the men were ISIS terrorists because they were using  racist language, talking about Muslims and Christians. A very similar occurrence took place in one of Minneapolis  more upscale neighborhoods last year when a mob of up to 30 young Somali men marched through the streets yelling disparaging comments and threatening homeowners:Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims. Residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this wasn t the first time a group of Somali men have made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.They first approached victim Gary Bohanna inquiring what religion he was affiliated with. When Bohanna answered I m a Christian,  the attacker shouted  Why aren t you a Muslim?  before punching him twice. The three men then approached Paul Lynch, Labour councillor for Moss Bank, and his girlfriend. One of the men punched Mr. Lynch with a  sickening blow  that could be  seen and heard.  He did not utter any racist comments, but the attackers laughed as the victim fell. Both men were taken to the hospital for their injuries.Witness Edris Nosrati called police but one of the men tried to flee, so the witness chased and caught him. The teenager struck Mr. Nosrati, but the hero held on. When questioned by police, one of the men claimed he was too intoxicated to remember anything. Another denied the assaults and suggested they had been racially abused by other men. However, he later confessed to  targeting people because they were white and non-Muslim. The Counter Terrorism Unit became involved in the investigation and the mens  family homes were turned upside down by the police. Amin Mohmed cried in court as he was jailed for 42 weeks. Mohammed and Faruq Patel received 42 and 18 weeks respectively in a young offenders institution.Read more: The Echo ",politics,"Jul 27, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
IRONY! COLLEGE “ANTI-CAPITALIST” GROUP DISBANDS Because Members Were too Rich and White,"You just can t make this stuff up! does anyone else see the HUGE irony in this?A Marxist student group at Swarthmore College disbanded itself earlier this year after realizing that its members were too rich and too white to be real commies.According to screenshots confidentially provided to Campus Reform by an individual with access to the group s private Facebook page, the demise of the Swarthmore Anti-Capitalist Collective (SACC) came in the wake of a farewell letter from a member who had decided the group could never be an effective proponent of  unproblematized anticapitalist politics  due to its  history of abuse, racism, and even classism. From my understanding SACC disbanded because they realized the makeup and tactics of their group was at odds with their espoused principles,  Swarthmore Conservative Society President Gilbert Guerra told Campus Reform.  Their main support base was middle-upper class white kids who enjoy jogging. The farewell letter corroborates Guerra s understanding, asserting that  SACC s fundamental failure  was that  at its formation, it was made up of entirely white, with the exception of one person of color*, students,  and to make matters worse,  not one of [the founding members] are from low-income and/or working class backgrounds. Arguing that  low-income people of color should never be an afterthought in a group whose politics supposedly focus on their liberation,  the author then went on to accuse SACC of having a  history of abuse, racism, and even classism that was never adequately addressed or recognized despite constantly being brought up as an issue.

CHELSEA CLINTON CRITICIZES President Trump Over Policy On Transgenders In Military…Forgot Whose Policy BANNED Openly Gay Soldiers From Serving In Our Military,"The unaccomplished Chelsea Clinton, wife of unemployed and perpetually vacationing husband Marc Mezvinsky, and daughter of America s most famous grifters, Bill and Hillary Clinton, took to Twitter to criticize President Trump s ban on transgenders in the military. It s worth noting that the woman whose wedding was paid for by the  charitable  Clinton Foundation, has assumed a new role, as the self-assigned new Democrat leader. There s only one problem with Chelsea s criticism she neglected to mention her father s ban on any military member who dared to be honest about being gay.Apparently in a hypocritical liberal s world, it s okay to ban openly gay military members, but it s hateful and a violation of human rights to ban openly transexual members of our military. Who better to make a policy that forces thousands of troops to keep secrets about their sexual lifestyle than the impeached former President Bill Clinton right Chelsea?Yesterday, the Washington Post tweeted about the hit piece they did on Trump s transgender ban:Analysis: Trump s stance on LGBT rights has always been confusing https://t.co/tNaSKJ082u  Washington Post (@washingtonpost) July 26, 2017Chelsea replied:No. President Trump has consistently failed to support LGBT equal rights, dignity & safety in the U.S. & around world (e.g. Chechnya/Russia) https://t.co/nXY5uYjz4S  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) July 26, 2017Don t Ask, Don t Tell (DADT), byname for the former official U.S. policy (1993 2011) regarding the service of homosexuals in the military. The term was coined after Pres. Bill Clinton in 1993 signed a law (consisting of statute, regulations, and policy memoranda) directing that military personnel  don t ask, don t tell, don t pursue, and don t harass.  When it went into effect on October 1, 1993, the policy theoretically lifted a ban on homosexual service that had been instituted during World War II, though in effect it continued a statutory ban.

DEMOCRAT SENATOR Claims Repeal Of Obamacare Based Only on ‘Hatred of Barack Obama’ [Video],"Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.) said Wednesday on MSNBC s  Morning Joe  that Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare are based on the GOP s  hatred of Barack Obama. MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude asked Murphy what he believes the  animating commitment  behind the GOP health care bill is and what it would take for him to work in a bipartisan way with Republicans to fix the country s health care system. At this point, I think it s clear the animating commitment is a hatred of Barack Obama,  Murphy said.  The policy has been pushed to the wayside here. They don t seem tremendously interested in actually crafting something that insures more people or reduces rates. They just want to fulfill this commitment that they made to repeal Obamacare. Murphy went on to say that he has made it very clear he wants to compromise with Republicans on health care. They want, as far as I can tell, flexibility of benefit design. They want something that has some cheaper premiums, less regulations in these exchanges. I m willing to talk to them about that,  Murphy said.  I m willing to give them some flexibility of benefit design if they re willing to give us some security on these exchanges that Donald Trump won t unwind them.

"AFTER MONTHS OF TRASHING OUR PRESIDENT, Senator McCain Explains How To Fix Rancor In DC : “Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio, television and the internet…To hell with them”","Conservative talk radio, tv and websites are no friends of RINO Senator John McCain, and he knows it. McCain used his moment he was given to shine on the Senate floor after being diagnosed with brain  cancer, to excoriate conservatives who speak out against him on talk radio, TV and the internet. For years, conservatives on social media have declared  open season  on RINO s (Republicans In Name Only) in DC. like Senator s John McCain (R-AZ) and his close ally Lindsey Graham (R-SC). In June 2015, candidate Hillary Clinton used her good working relationships with McCain and Graham as examples of how she can reach out across the aisle.McCain has been a thorn in the side of President Trump and has been openly antagonistic towards him since it became apparent Trump would be the Republican candidate for president. Only one day after his surgery and diagnosis with brain cancer, Senator John McCain just couldn t help himself. While millions of Americans were praying for his recovery, McCain took to Twitter to admonish President Trump over his decision to end a failed program that was supposed to train, fund and arm Syrians to fight Assad and ISIS.Tuesday on the Senate floor, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) gave a speech upon returning from Arizona after having an emergency craniotomy to remove a blood clot and a subsequent diagnosis of cancer.McCain cast the deciding vote to begin the health care debate and chided both sides for not being bipartisan over the last several years, saying,  I voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and amendments to be offered. I will not vote for this bill as it is today. McCain said,  I hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other, to learn how to trust each other again, and by so doing, better serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio, television and the internet. To hell with them. They don t want anything done for the public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood. Here s how conservative radio and tv host Mark Levin reacted to McCain s comments:Oh my. I'm hurt to the core.   https://t.co/jfnssmz9RJ  Mark R. Levin (@marklevinshow) July 26, 2017McCain went on to encourage his fellow Senators to get behind him and help find a way to fix the disastrous Obamacare,  Our health care insurance system is a mess. We all know it. Those who support Obamacare and those who oppose it. Something has to be done. He added,  We Republicans have looked for a way to end it and replace it with something else without paying a terrible political price. We haven t found it yet. And I m not sure we will. All we have managed to do is make more popular a policy that wasn t very popular when we started trying to get rid of it. I voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and amendments to be offered. I will not vote for this bill as it is today. It s a shell of a bill right now, we all know that. I have changes urged by my state s governor that will need to be made before I support any bill. I know the bill has to change substantially before you will support it.

NANCY PELOSI Connected to DNC Staffer Charged With Bank Fraud After Trying to Flee the US,"The shocking revelations just keep on coming in this DNC IT case. The main stream media refuses to jump in on this hot story because it leads to damaging information against the Democrats. Several Muslim Brotherhood connected people worked for the DNC and had access to the sensitive information from Congress:It appears the IT staffer had access to Rep. Pelosi s iPad:Wikileaks has released the email below where it looks like Imran has access to Nancy Pelosi s iPad! Pelosi is doing closed door meeting. No staff or anyone allowed. Kaitlyn come to Rayburn room and get her iPad for Imran. Thanks.Tracie and Kate I will call Kate. Conf in TracieRosalyn Kumar Rep. Wasserman SchultzThe bottom line in this case is that red flags were everywhere so why hasn t anyone blown this case wide open?Some things stand out that should be looked at:Awan smashed his hard drives in an effort to destroy them.Awan and his relatives were paid large amounts of money ($4 million) over a decade but they declared bankruptcy in 2012.Awan and his brothers are connected to the Muslim BrotherhoodDebbie Wasserman Schultz threatened the Capitol Police  by saying there would be  consequences  if they didn t give a computer back that was being kept as part of the investigation:Fraud Charge: Awan is accused of attempting to defraud the Congressional Federal Credit Union by obtaining a $165,000 home equity loan for a rental property, which is against the credit union s policies since it is not the owner s primary residence. Those funds were then included as part of a wire transfer to two individuals in Faisalabad, Pakistan.Awan s family had already fled the country with no intention of coming back: Awan was arrested at Dulles Airport on Monday evening before boarding a flight to Lahore, Pakistan.

BREAKING: DNC HACKER FIRED For Bank Fraud…Blames Islamophobia and “Ultra Right-Wing Media”,"Apparently breaking the law and scamming the government is excusable if you can conveniently blame discrimination. And when the media is ignoring your illegal activity, who s stopping you from getting away with anything? After being detained for bank fraud charges on Monday, Imran Awan s attorney recently released a statement blaming islamophobia and the  ultra right-wing media :This Pakistani family was under criminal investigation by the U.S. Capitol Police for abusing their access to the House of Representatives information technology (IT) system. Abid, Imran and Jamal Awan accessed Congressmen and Congress people s computer networks unauthorized and engaged in a myriad of other questionable schemes besides allegedly placing  ghost employees  on the congressional payroll.Capitol Police revoked the Awans  access to the congressional IT system in February 2017 after a major data breach was detected. Their access had allowed them to read emails and files of dozens of members, including many serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.Imran Awan, his wife Hina, and brothers Abid and Jamal collectively netted more than $4 million in salary as IT administrators for House Democrats between 2009 and 2017. Yet the absence of signs of wealth displayed among them raise questions. Was the money sent overseas or did something other than paychecks motivate their actions? Both Imran and his wife were traveling to Pakistan earlier this week carrying $12,000. However, Imran was arrested before he could board the plane.Today, Awan s attorney released a statement claiming the attacks on Mr. Awan and his family began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.  He goes on by saying that they have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing  pizzagate  media but from sitting members of Congress.  The attorney claims the couple were traveling to see their family for the first time in months after being  abruptly and unjustly fired.

PRIVACY ALERT: YOUR VACUUM CLEANER IS SPYING ON YOU…No Consent Required to Share Your Data,"A fly on the wall? More like a spy on the floor of your home. It turns out that your dog isn t the only one who should be weary of your Roomba. This popular home cleaning device has been mapping homes using a camera and sensors since 2015 in order to maximize efficiency. However, they plan to sell this data to smart home device manufacturers such as Google, Amazon and Apple, the company said Tuesday.While it may seem like the information being gathered is minimal and harmless, there is a lot to be said for the maps each device is collecting. It knows the floor plan of your home, the basic shape of everything on your floor, what areas require the most maintenance, and how often you require cleaning cycles, along with many other data points.If this doesn t make you suspicious, it probably should. This is all part of the larger mission for major companies to glean every bit of data about you that they can. Now, they want to know all about your living space. iRobot CEO Colin Angle stated that user data won t be sold without permission and he thinks most people will want to take advantage of the greater functionality.In actuality, their terms of agreement allow the company enough freedom to share your data internally, with subsidiaries, third party vendors, and the government upon request. A section within their terms of agreement specifically states that they may  share your personal information with other parties in connection with any company transaction, such as a merger, sale of all or a portion of company assets or shares In summary, they do not need your consent if iRobot wanted to sell its user data in bulk.

LOL! THE BOSTON GLOBE Gets DESTROYED On Social Media After Publishing Article Criticizing Mitt Romney For Waterskiing During Health Care Vote,"More manufactured news that exposes the hate our leftist media has for Republicans Even for those who haven t been in office in years.The Boston Globe set heads scratching Tuesday after the newspaper published a story on former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney s whereabouts during the Senate health care vote.The former Massachusetts governor is now a private citizen removed from the debate to repeal and replace Obamacare. But the Globe wrote a story highlighting Romney s daughter-in-law s Instagram post showing he was jetskiing at the time. While the Senate debated health care, Mitt Romney was waterskiing,  read the original headline, which was later updated to read,  Romney, long out of the political fray, takes to the water. It s been a contentious week in Washington,  the Globe wrote.  One Republican who appears to be unbothered by all the political tumult? That would be Mitt Romney.

AWESOME! WHAT HAPPENED After City Council Member Said Trump Supporters ‘Have No Business’ in Charlotte Government Will Make Your Day!,"You would think Charlotte is lost to the liberals There are lefty Democrats living there who don t understand that they don t get to decide who is involved in local government THE VOTERS DO! Dimple Ajmera decided to characterize President Trump as divisive but it s ironic that SHE is the one who s dividing people. After her nasty remarks about Trump, the Trump supporters filled the next City Council meeting in protest. Awesome! Charlotte City Council member Dimple Ajmera drew the ire of the local Republican Party after she said that Republicans who support Trump should not be involved in local government:DANGEROUS RHETORIC: Republicans that are supporting Trump, they should have no place on city council whatsoever or in the mayor s race,  Ajmera said on the news show Flashpoint on WCNC, which aired Sunday.Ajmera, a Democrat, was appointed to the council in January to replace John Autry, who left council to join the N.C. General Assembly. Ajmera is running for one of four at-large seats this fall.Ajmera stood by her comments Tuesday. Charlotte rejected Trump in the 2016 elections,  she said.  So people are upset by what he represents. He values divisiveness. We can t let that divide us as we tackle important issues like economic mobility and as we address the issues of last September. Half of those attending Monday s City Council meeting carried  Trump-Pence  signs, and waved small American flags.The two sides re-fought the 2016 presidential election after City Council member Dimple Ajmera said on a television show last week that Trump voters shouldn t be on City Council or in the mayor s race   controversial comments that she has backed repeatedly.Her campaign manager, Dan McCorkle, attended the meeting, waving his own pro-Ajmera signs. McCorkle told Trump supporters that Hillary Clinton received more than 70 percent of the vote in the city of Charlotte.LIBERAL BUZZWORDS WE VE COME TO EXPECT:Sebastian Feculak spoke at the council s public forum. I wanted to applaud Dimple for standing up for equity and unity,  he said.  You are welcome here no matter what. Our politics are not for xenophopia, racism or sexism.

They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old one of the guys, the other was 25. They re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background! If you haven t been following this crazy series of events, we ve got a previous report below to fill you in. Basically, Imran Awan and three Muslim relatives were hired to handle IT for the DNC which gave them access to lots of sensitive information NOT GOOD! The Daily Caller just exclusively reported that Awan attempted to destroy hard drives then desperately tried to retrieve them when they were discovered.GETTING THOSE DESTROYED HARD RIVES BACK:Pakistani-born Imran Awan, long-time right-hand IT aide to the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairwoman, has since desperately tried to get the hard drives back, the individual told The Daily Caller News Foundation s Investigative Group.A high-level congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the probe, confirmed that the FBI has joined what Politico previously described as a Capitol Police criminal probe into  serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network  by Imran and three of his relatives, who had access to the emails and files of the more than two dozen House Democrats who employed them on a part-time basis.Capitol Police have also seized computer equipment tied to the Florida lawmaker.Awan s younger brothers, Abid and Jamal, his wife, Hina Alvi, and Rao Abbas, Imran s best friend, are also under investigation. There have been no arrests in the case.THIS CASE IS HUGE! MARIA BARTIROMO IS LIVID ABOUT IT:A Pakistani family under criminal investigation by the U.S. Capitol Police (see our previous report below) for abusing their access to the House of Representatives information technology (IT) system may have engaged in myriad other questionable schemes besides allegedly placing  ghost employees  on the congressional payroll.Imran Awan, his wife Hina, and brothers Abid and Jamal collectively netted more than $4 million in salary as IT administrators for House Democrats between 2009 and 2017.

Their access had allowed them to read emails and files of dozens of members, including many serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS   THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS IGNORING THE CRIMINALITY OF THESE BROTHERS:3 MUSLIM BROTHERS Working For Dems In Congress CAUGHT Accessing Unauthorized Top-Secret Government Intel One Has Criminal Background May Have Ties To Muslim Brotherhood [VIDEO]3 Congressional IT employees have been fired for accessing members computer networks without permission. Maria s on the show, knows more about this. Can you fill me in a bit.Here are their names Stuart. let me tell you what the 3 people that were fired on Thursday: Abid, Imran and Jamal Awan. They were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people s computer networks unauthorized. At a minimum they were fired. At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence, foreign affairs and intelligence committees.  Okay? So they were getting very important information, government information. They accessed these computers. That is the least of it. There s also some talk that people are looking into what ties they have into terrorism. Are they impacted by the Muslim Brotherhood? Are they a part of the Muslim Brotherhood? One of them has a criminal background!How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one? They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old one of the guys, the other was 25. They re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background! I hear what you re saying, I mean, these intelligence committees handle our terror strategies right? They got in on Benghazi by the way.Yes, and they also worked for many Democrats in the House. They are thinking that they may be also one of the reasons Debbie Wasserman Schultz got hacked. There s so much more to come on this Stuart, it s an incredible story. I think it s amazing!Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Their salaries and time were shared among dozens of Democratic members, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Despite the generous salaries, the four were involved in multiple suspicious mortgage transfers and a debt-evading bankruptcy. Abid had more than $1 million in debts following a failed business called Cars International that he ran in Falls Church, Va., from November 2009 to September 2010. Business associates said in court documents that Abid had stolen money and vehicles from them.It s unclear how Abid found time to run an automotive business while working full-time for Congress. He had been on the congressional payroll since 2005. A congressional credit union repossessed two of his personal cars before the business folded.Abid filed for bankruptcy in 2012, but somehow managed to keep ownership of two houses while telling the bankruptcy court and creditors that he had no assets with which to pay them. He signed a sworn statement that he and his wife, Natalia Soba, were living apart and needed separate residences. My spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purpose of evading the requirements of   707(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code,  Abid claimed in bankruptcy documents. But both houses had been in the family for years.Abid s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.A spokesman for Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas told TheDCNF Friday that Jamal s  employment with our office has been terminated. Hilarie Chambers, a spokeswoman for Rep. Sandy Levin   who employed Abid   told TheDCNF that  after being notified by the House Administration Committee, this individual was removed from our payroll. We are confident that everything in our office is secure. Not every Democrat is willing to terminate their connection with these four:Some Democrats have not terminated their connection with the four, including Wasserman Schultz, who employs Imran and who resigned from her DNC post last year after a computer hack revealed embarassing emails. Derrick Robinson, spokesman for California Rep. Karen Bass, refused to comment on Alvi s employment status.For entire story: Daily Caller",politics,"Jul 25, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Politico confirmed this report, noting that Short walked out in the middle of the campaign leaving his computer behind only to show back up in January at the behest of the Republican National Committee (RNC) allies in the White House. He was scorned by many of his colleagues for quitting the Trump campaign, only to rejoin as a White House staffer because of Priebus,  Palmeri wrote of Short.  In a story often retold by campaign staffers, they arrived at Trump Tower one morning, months before the election, to see Short s computer left open on his otherwise empty desk. He had quit the campaign that day and never returned. The next time he was seen by former campaign staffers was in January on their first day in the White House, where some were stunned to learn that they were going to have to work alongside him or for some of the press assistants subordinate to him. Multiple White House sources tell Breitbart News that Short was a leaker, and worked closely with now former White House deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh another RNC wing official who was terminated earlier this year for her own suspected leaking.  Breitbart NewsCould Reince Priebus be next?Heavy   Could Short s and Spicer s resignations be a bad omen for the future of Priebus, the former RNC chairman turned chief of staff who once ran the Republican Party in Wisconsin?There certainly seems to be a diminishing in the ranks of his supporters inside the Trump bubble (and he was reported to have opposed the hiring of Scaramucci by The New York Times and other publications). However, Priebus and Scaramucci have publicly spoken positively about each other since Scaramucci was hired. Trump seems to be relying more than before on a tight circle of family members and political outsiders like Scaramucci. The potential shake-up has exacerbated long-simmering tensions between Scaramucci and chief of staff Reince Priebus,  reported The Washington Post.

"AS ANGRY FAR LEFT PROTESTERS Scream ‘Kill the Bill’, Senator John McCain Returns to Deliver Stunning Speech [Video]","The left is truly becoming unhinged! The tension is high and the stakes are even higher in Washington as the Senate goes forward with debate on a bill to repeal Obamacare. While the US Senate voted today to open debate on the Obamacare bill, screams from far left protestors erupted from the Senate gallery. This far left mob chanted phrases such as  Kill the Bill,   Don t Kill Us,  and  Shame. The protesters interrupted the proceedings before the calling of the roll for nearly two minutes. It then took several minutes for the Sergeant of Arms and federal officers to remove the group of far left protestors. Many official Congressional votes require the gallery visitors to be given passes by legislators. It is highly likely that Democratic legislators gave these protestors access to the gallery.The emotional return of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to the Senate for the vote, after he was recently diagnosed with brain cancer is sure to put more pressure on nervous Republicans who have been opposed or reluctant to commit to support the Republican plan.John McCain:  I hope again we can rely on humility on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other, to learn how to trust each other again, and by so doing better serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio, television and the internet. To hell with them! Despite uncertainty, the administration is predicting victory. Vice President Mike Pence s top legislative affairs aide, Marc Short, stated Tuesday morning on Fox Business News that, whether [McCain] is the 50th or the 51st vote, we re excited to have him back.

She took it to a new low. You can hear the harsh comments at the 1:30 point:Sen. Jack Reed (D., R.I.) was caught on a hot mic telling Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) on Tuesday that she could  beat the shit out of   a Republican congressman who had criticized her and other female Republican senators who were hampering Obamacare repeal efforts.The two senators were at the markup of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2018 discussing multiple issues among themselves when Reed skewered Rep. Blake Farenthold (R., Texas).Farenthold said in an interview last Friday that he might settle Republican opposition to health care efforts  Aaron Burr-style  if the senators were men from his home state of Texas, according to CNN.Reed said that there were some  crazy people  in the House, which prompted Collins to ask him whether he had heard of Farenthold s remarks. The comment appeared to be a reference to the 1804 duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, which resulted in Hamilton s death. I know, trust me. You know why he challenged you to a duel? Because you could beat the shit out of him,  Reed said. He s huge! He s so unattractive, it s unbelievable COLLINS WOULD BE A DEMOCRAT IN ANY OTHER STATE!

TQILA s members have watched in horror as fascist and extremist forces around the world have attacked the Queer community and murdered countless of our community members citing that they are  ill,   sick  and  unatural,  the volunteer fighters group, International Revolution People s Guerilla Forces (IRPGF), wrote on Twitter when announcing the formation of the new unit.The IRPGF is a group of foreign fighters who traveled to northern Syria to fight ISIS alongside the Kurdish militia, People s Protection Unit, known as YPG. The images of gay men being thrown off roofs and stoned to death by Daesh was something we could not idly watch,  they said.The group also posted an image of two soldiers brandishing a banner reading,  These f s kill fascists,  in front their logo, a pink flag with a black AK-47 machine gun, and a rainbow flag in Raqqa, with the caption  #Queers smashing the caliphate.

WOW! CHICAGO RESIDENTS Blast “Democratic Machine” For Ruining The City…”They Want You to Think Donald Trump Is The Problem…White and Black Democrats Are Doing This To Us” [VIDEO],"This isn t the first punch this group of black Chicago residents have delivered to the failed Democrat Party. In 2015, they made a video message directly aimed at Barack Obama and the Democrat Party. The video exposed the lies Obama and the Democrats told Chicago residents to get votes, and then after the election, they ignored the residents while unemployment rates and crime skyrocketed and the city crumbled around them. Watch the VIRAL video HERE.The taxpayer-funded installation of a giant, gold-lettered  #RealFake  sculpture, placed by Chicago just opposite Trump Tower, serves as the backdrop for a cutting short film,  Chicago Carnage,  from RebelPundit filmmakers Jeremy Segal and Andrew Marcus featuring community organizers Paul McKinley and Mark Carter.The city of Chicago installed the sculpture just across the Chicago River from Trump Tower in a space that could only be intended to give a giant middle finger to President Trump late last month. The sculpture sits as perfect photo-op to take selfies and group photos flipping off the Trump sign, while standing underneath it right next to the golden sculpture that screams Real Fake.Both say Chicago is a city that is overrun with very real deadly violence and poverty within a few short miles from this sculpture and it is by intentional design under the  liberal agenda. It is ironic that this sign would show up right here, and not in front of City Hall,  McKinley says. It is a  great deception  to distract people from  real issues. Carter says,  They are not trying to resolve the problems in this city, they need things to happen exactly the way they are happening .The fake news is that this city is a city for everyone .This is city for the elite.  He goes on to slam the city for looking like  a bomb has been dropped,  and looking  like a third world city. Every day of the week there is a body count, 30 people shot up, 40 people shot up, that s not real fake,   says McKinley. They want you to be focused on Donald Trump being the problem,  Carter said, to which McKinley asks,  why are we all messed up, Trump just got in there? There is nothing fake about this guy,  said Carter,  he tells you what he s about, the fake is Barack Obama, the fake is Bill Clinton. The Democrat machine is dummying down the people, socially engineering the people into poverty.They want you to believe that there is some white racist Republicans or some white racist conservative doing this. No, this is the democrat machine, these are white and black racist Democrats that are doing this to us.They don t want the killing to stop. They need the people to continue to poor. They need these blood sucking programs, that have never done anything to bring down violence, unemployment and poverty.McKinley says,  this is the most racist city and segregated city in the country, right here in Chicago.

MASSACHUSETTS VOTES TO IGNORE FED LAW and Let Illegals Go…This Sanctuary State Endangers All Americans!,"MASSACHUSETTS IS NOW A SANCTUARY STATE! The Massachusetts Supreme Court just ruled that illegals are to be released and not held under federal law. This puts all Americans at risk! Tucker Carlson previously interviewed a State Rep. who supports subverting federal law. Please listen to the skewed reasoning for not following federal law:In a ruling hailed by civil liberties advocates that ends a longstanding immigration enforcement practice, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declared Monday that current state law  provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody. State Representative James Lyons, an Andover Republican, said he is working with Republican Representatives Marc Lombardo of Billerica, and Shaunna O Connell of Taunton to gather co-sponsors on a bill he plans to file Tuesday or Wednesday. Lyons said the bill would be  straightforward,  giving Massachusetts police and court officers the power to arrest someone on a civil immigration warrant.  People are concerned about the rule of law,  Lyons told the News Service. Asked about how he thought the bill would fare in the Democrat-controlled Legislature, Lyons said,  Beacon Hill, I can t predict what s going on up there.  While the high court ruling focused on court officers, advocates said the opinion prohibits any state official from keeping someone jailed solely at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Going forward, nobody in Massachusetts should be held on an immigration detainer unless the Legislature were to attempt to change that,  said Emma Winger, Immigration Impact Unit staff attorney for the Committee on Public Counsel Services, who argued the case before the Supreme Judicial Court in April. It applies to anybody with arrest authority,  said Laura Rotolo, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. Rotolo said that while many jurisdictions have limited their cooperation with ICE, the SJC is the first state high court to rule against ICE detainers.Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said the decision will make people more vulnerable to crime in Massachusetts.  I wouldn t say it makes Massachusetts a sanctuary state. I think it makes Massachusetts more vulnerable   the people who live here and people who visit here   more vulnerable to become victims of crime, and also a further message to people throughout the country who are here illegally that we re the place you want to come,  Hodgson said.Read more: New Boston Post",politics,"Jul 25, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
Jason Chaffetz Calls Out the GOP: “Republicans need to get a backbone!” [Video]," Republicans need to get a backbone,  says former Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) when asked about the testimony of Jared Kushner before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Every time the Democrats say they need to call up Jared Kushner or Donald Trump Jr., then call up Chelsea Clinton, call up the Clintons. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md3pmA-IZ_EChaffetz was on fire:  There we have an Inspector General who issues a report stating an actual crime. You have Bill Clinton, the former President, taking millions and millions of dollars from countries that Hillary Clinton was then going into and doing business. So every time a Democrat says,  I gotta talk to Donald Trump Jr., then go up and bring Chelsea Clinton in there. Because she was involved in the Benghazi situation, she was involved with the Foundation. I mean, when I tried as the chairman of the Oversight Committee, to bring in Ben Rhodes to talk about the Iran situation, nobody knows what the deal with Iran was, they claimed executive privilege. Chaffetz says they would never do this to the Clintons and he s right on the money:  They would never, ever, ever do this to the Clintons. And that is what is fundamentally wrong with this. They could have easily, out of all the people in the world they could have easily claimed executive privilege on this one, proximity to the President, it s his son-in-law, he s his closest adviser, he could have easily pulled that off. But there he is, he s gonna go in there as an open book and they should get a lot of credit for it.

SNOPES IMPLODES! Liberal “Fact-Checker” Turns To GoFundMe To Keep Business Alive…LOL!,"Where s George Soros when his top  fact  checkers, aka  conservative news slayers , need him?Snopes.com is a liberal blog from 1994. The website claims to be the internet s oldest and most popular fact-checking site. Last year, Snopes Co-Founder was accused of embezzling company money, and spending it on prostitutes.Now you can find the blog begging for $500k in funding via GoFundMe. So, far the campaign has raised $18,000 in 3 hours via 710 people   Zero HedgeFacebook users who are too stupid to figure out if a story is  fake  or real can now rely on a porn star with an escort service and her husband as well as a woman who admits to smoking to pot while  fact checking  stories .In December of 2016, Facebook announced plans to check for  fake news  using a series of organizations to assess whether stories are true.Here are a few facts most Snopes users probably don t know  about  fact-checker  Snopes: One of them is a website called Snopes.com which claims to be one of the web s  essential resources  and  painstaking, scholarly and reliable It was founded by husband-and-wife Barbara and David Mikkelson, who used a letterhead claiming they were a non-existent society to start their research Now they are divorced   with Barbara claiming in legal documents he embezzled $98,000 of company money and spent it on  himself and prostitutes In a lengthy and bitter legal dispute he is claiming to be underpaid and demanding  industry standard  or at least $360,000 a year The two also dispute what are basic facts of their case   despite Snopes.com saying its  ownership  is committed to  accuracy and impartiality Snopes.com founder David Mikkelson s new wife Elyssa Young is employed by the website as an administrator She has worked as an escort and porn actress and despite claims website is non-political ran as a Libertarian for Congress on a  Dump Bush  platform Its main  fact checker  is Kimberly LaCapria, whose blog  ViceVixen  says she is in touch with her  domme side  and has posted on Snopes.com while smoking potOne of the websites Facebook is to use to arbitrate on  fake news  is involved in a bitter legal dispute between its co-founders, with its CEO accused of using company money for prostitutes.Snopes.com will be part of a panel used by Facebook to decide whether stories which users complain about as potentially  fake  should be considered  disputed .Popular myth-busting website Snopes originally gained recognition for being the go-to site for disproving outlandish urban legends -such as the presence of UFOs in Haiti or the existence of human-animal hybrids in the Amazon jungle.Recently, however, the site has tried to pose as a political fact-checker. But Snopes   fact-checking  looks more like playing defense for prominent Democrats. Its political  fact-checker  describes herself as a liberal and has called Republicans  regressive  and afraid of  female agency. Snopes  main political fact-checker is a writer named Kim Lacapria.

HEARTBREAKING: Baby Charlie Gard’s Parents End Legal Battle to Come to the US [Video],"This news is heartbreaking because it s the unnecessary delay in treatment that ultimately determined the fate of this little baby:  The window of opportunity has been lost Chris Gard and Connie Yates announced their decision as a high court judge was preparing to oversee the latest round of a five-month legal battle.The parents have said they want to withdraw their application for him to receive experimental treatment in the US because it was  too late  for it to work.In a move that would appear to bring an end to a protracted, emotional legal case in which Great Ormond Street hospital (Gosh) argued his life support should be switched off to prevent him suffering further, their lawyer said on Monday that delays meant  it was no longer in Charlie s interests  to keep him on a ventilator.Mr Justice Francis had been scheduled to analyse what the couple said was fresh evidence at a hearing in the family division of the high court in London.Grant Armstrong, representing Charlie s parents, told the high court in London:  For Charlie, it s too late, time has run out, irreversible muscular damage has been done and the treatment can no longer be a success. He said the parents had made the most painful of decisions, that only parents can make. Armstrong said:  Charlie has waited patiently for treatment. Due to delay, that window of opportunity has been lost. Baby Charlie Gard was born has a rare genetic condition from his parents and is blind, deaf and can only breathe through a ventilator.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON BABY CHARLIE GARD:The horrible result of socialized medicine may be seen in the plight of Charlie Gard. The brain-damaged British baby whose parents recently lost a legal battle to keep him on life support   has now tugged at heart strings as far away as the Oval Office.President Trump tweeted out his willingness to lend a hand   and in doing so exposed the debate over who should make life-and-death decisions for Charlie to a massive audience. If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so,  Trump wrote.The tweet, which noted a similar call for compassion from Pope Francis on Sunday night, comes just ahead of Trump s second international trip later this week, during which he ll meet with world leaders at the G-20 summit it Germany   a conference at which Trump could cross paths with British Prime Minister Theresa May.Trump s tweet also implicitly highlights perceived pitfalls in the British health care system   a publicly funded system   at a time the U.S. is undergoing yet another debate about medical coverage.Gard s parents have fought the courts to keep their son on life support. Chris Gard and Connie Yates want to bring Charlie to the U.S. for experimental therapy. But doctors at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, who have been caring for Charlie, were granted permission by a court to turn off his life support. Though it was expected Charlie could be removed from the essential devices as soon as Friday, the hospital said in a statement it was putting together unspecified plans to give the 11 month old and his parents  more time together as a family.

BREAKING: JARED KUSHNER SPEAKS…”I did not collude with Russia” [Video],"Jared Kushner just spoke out on being accused of  colluding  with the Russians during the 2016 campaign: President Trump had a better message & ran a smarter campaign. That is why he won. Suggesting otherwise, ridicules those who voted for him. He hit back at the media:THE MEETING WENT  VERY WELL : Jared Kushner said Monday that his closed-door meeting with congressional staff investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election went  very well.  Kushner added as he was leaving the meeting that he answered  as many  questions as the staffers had.Prior to the Monday morning meeting, Kushner released an 11- page statement in which he denied colluding with any foreign government during last year s presidential race. I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,  Kushner said in the statement. He denied having improper communications with Kremlin officials as well as any knowledge of Trump campaign officials conspiring with Moscow.The closed-door hearing on Capitol Hill came after reports revealed that Kushner joined Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in a meeting with a Russian lawyer, who Trump Jr. believed had incriminating information on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Kushner is expected to meet with the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, which is leading its own investigation into Russia s meddling in the 2016 election.",politics,"Jul 24, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
MN: SOMALI MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS Explain Why It’s Acceptable To Kill Anyone Who Insults Mohammed [VIDEO],"Ami Horowitz is a thought provoking filmmaker who took a lot of heat for exposing the truth about the horrific, violent  no-go zones  in Sweden in one of his recent documentary films. Horowitz is also very controversial because he doesn t shy away from asking tough questions of the people he randomly interviews on the streets.In fiscal year 2014, Minnesota took in 2,232 refugees, according to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. Almost half of those were from Somalia.In the video below, Ami took to the streets in the Cedar Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, MN to talk a variety of Somali Muslim immigrants. Ami posed several questions to a large variety of random Somali Muslim immigrants. He asked young boys, teenagers, middle-aged men and even an older woman their thoughts on how they felt about living in the United States, and if they d rather living back in Somalia. Horowitz also asked if they would prefer to live under Sharia Law or American laws. Their answers may surprise you.The most shocking part of the video however, comes near the end when Horowitz begins to discuss freedom of speech in America. While one of the men being interviewed talks about how great it is to be in America and to be afforded rights like freedom of speech and freedom of religion, every single Muslim respondent believed that free speech is great unless it involves criticizing the prophet Mohammed. Horowitz took his question a step further and asked if was okay for Muslims to use violence against someone who disparaged or insulted Mohammed. Every Muslim he asked, believed that using violence, including killing a person who criticized or mocked Mohammed, would be justified.Watch:After a major dip in 2008, the year ly num bers of new So ma li refu gees in Minnesota have re bounded stead i ly. The num ber of So malis re set tled in the state has more than trip led in four years.

The developments of the past week are very bothersome, very disturbing to me,  Clapper said on CNN s  State of the Union  on Sunday. I think in many ways our institutions are under assault, both externally   and that s the big news here, the Russian interference in our election system   and I think as well, our institutions are under assault internally, When asked if he meant if those institutions were  under assault  internally by the president himself, Clapper said  exactly  and added that he believed Trump was undermining the checks and balances inherent to the U.S. political system.",politics,"Jul 24, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

According to the screenshots, Freeman replied:  I won t be upset with you if you can t have us there for these reasons, and I wish you the best. We would love to be there, of course, but I sincerely do understand if you decide to replace us with someone who supports the candidate you support. This woman is so talented!

"SCARAMUCCI ON WH LEAKS: “If you’re going to keep leaking, I’m going to fire everybody.” [VIDEO]","It s about time! The White House has been leaking like a sieve. New White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci flatly said Sunday that he as going to fire all future leakers on his watch: We re as strong as our weakest leak A smug John Dickerson asked Scaramucci why President Donald Trump had tweeted a day earlier about his ability to grant pardons. Scaramucci said the leaks of that conversation and other leaks were  unprofessional,   injurious to the government,  and possibly  felonious. He s done absolutely nothing wrong. There s no need for him to pardon anybody,  Scaramucci said.  But he just doesn t like the fact that he has a two-minute conversation in the Oval Office or in his study, and then people are running out and leaking that. What happens to leakers on your watch?  Dickerson asked. They re going to get fired,  Scaramucci said.Scaramucci said he would hold a staff meeting on Monday and make it clear that anyone who wants to stay on will not leak private conversations to the press. We re as strong as our weakest leak,  he said.  So if you guys want to keep leaking, why don t you guys all get together and make a decision as a team that you re going to stop leaking.

WATCH: 94-Yr Old PEARL HARBOR SURVIVOR Donald Stratton Fights Back Tears As He Thanks President Trump For Bringing USA Together Again,"American pride and American exceptionalism is back. It shows in the confidence our military has in their newly elected Commander in Chief and in the confidence Americans have in the private sector, thanks to our President and in his hard-working administration. For anyone who needs evidence, watch brave 94-yr old Pearl Harbor veteran Donald Stratton thank Trump for bringing the USA back together again after 8 long divided years under Barack Obama  Lauren Bruner and Donald Stratton visited the White House on Friday, a trip they would have missed if a man named Joe George had not defied orders more than 75 years ago at Pearl Harbor.Bruner, 96, Stratton, 94, along with Ken Potts, 95, were survivors of the USS Arizona, a battleship destroyed during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. The three men reunited Friday at Arlington National Cemetery and then met with President Trump at the White House.It was 94-yr. old Donald Stratton s comments to President Trump that really struck a cord with him, as Trump asked Stratton to repeat his comments, as they would have likely been edited by the mainstream media in attendance at the special event. Trump told the press,  You ll want to hear this folks, it s very it s  just a very beautiful statement. Stratton then told the cameras:  All the people we met today, and all the people that were lined along as we went along, you could tell with the military and everything, that this country s coming together again, and we re gonna be there!  Stratton then gave a mini-fist pump as he fought back the tears of pride over our new Commander in Chief:MUST WATCH Pearl Harbor survivor Donald Stratton fights back tears as he thanks Trump for bringing the USA together! pic.twitter.com/ZIVPP8AtVb  Newt-Trump Fan Club (@NewtTrump) July 23, 2017As the number of Arizona survivors has dwindled to five   Bruner, Potts, Stratton, Lou Conter, 95, and Lonnie Cook, 96   the group is increasingly vocal about their experience and in advocating for recognition of George, who saved the lives of Stratton and Bruner but never received any honors for doing so.Coming to Washington, for the three survivors, meant more than time to honor those who were lost in the attack: It was also a chance to advocate for recognition for George.Stratton said he was unable to ask Trump to honor his friend but was able to speak about George and feels like progress was made. We didn t actually get any conversation with the president but all the conversation was in front of the press and we spoke about Joe George,  Stratton said.  I think we accomplished a lot today through that and getting his story out there. Stratton and Bruner survived the wreckage thanks to George s bravery. George was on a neighboring ship, the Vestal, when the bombs hit the Arizona. He defied orders from an officer to leave the area and instead saved six men who were in a gunner s control tower while their ship was engulfed in flames.The six escaped when George threw a weighted rope to the Arizona and the men climbed hand over hand down it to the Vestal. Bruner was the second-to-last man to leave the ship.Both Stratton and Bruner suffered severe burns and spent weeks in the hospital before returning to serve. The burns on Stratton s hands smoothed his fingertips, removing the grooves and his ability to make an identifiable fingerprint.Because George did not obey orders to leave the area, the Navy did not ever issue him a medal. Stratton believes he should receive a Navy Cross posthumously.Trump thanked the veterans for their heroic service. There are many remarkable things that I witness as president, but nothing can take the place of meeting heroes like those with us today,  Trump said.  In them we see the strength of our nation, the courage of our men and women in uniform, the resolve to never accept failure, and the belief that justice will always triumph. The meeting was an honor Stratton says he never envisioned. This is something I never expected in my whole life I met some very interesting people, Stratton said.  This country is so apart and this is something which brings us together. The men were honored with a certificate memorializing their visit to the cemetery and a coin from the Old Guard Third Infantry Regiment, who guard the tomb.

"HORRIFIC Human Trafficking Case: 8 PEOPLE FOUND DEAD, 38 Locked Inside Tractor-Trailer Outside Walmart…No A/C…101 Degrees [VIDEO]","Anyone who takes part in this type of sub-human criminal activity should never see the light of day again. The lawmakers who refuse to lock down our borders and stiffen the penalties for human traffickers who bring illegal aliens into the U.S. should also be held accountable by their constituents Eight people were found dead in a tractor-trailer outside a Walmart store in the stifling summer heat in what police called a horrific human trafficking case, and the driver was arrested.Several other people, possibly dozens, were found in the truck, which didn t have a working air conditioning system despite blistering temperatures that topped 100 degrees, and they were taken to hospitals, authorities said. The driver had been held, authorities said, but they didn t release the driver s identity.A person from the truck approached a Walmart employee in a parking lot and asked for water late Saturday night or early Sunday morning, said police in San Antonio, where temperatures on Saturday reached 101 degrees. The employee gave the person the water and then called police, and when officers arrived they found the eight people dead in the back of the trailer, police Chief William McManus said.Investigators checked store surveillance video, which showed vehicles had arrived and picked up other people from the tractor-trailer, police said. We re looking at a human trafficking crime this evening,  McManus said.He called the case  a horrific tragedy. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was involved in the investigation into what happened, he said.The National Weather Service s local office said the temperature in San Antonio hit 101 degrees just before 5 p.m. Saturday and didn t dip below 90 degrees until after 10 p.m.Other cases of human trafficking in the United States have led to more deaths. In May 2003, 19 immigrants being transported from South Texas to Houston died inside a sweltering tractor-trailer.Prosecutors said the driver in the 2003 case heard the immigrants begging and screaming for their lives as they were succumbing to the stifling heat inside his truck but refused to free them. The driver was resentenced in 2011 to nearly 34 years in prison after a federal appeals court overturned the multiple life sentences he had received.  NYPMany of the human trafficking cases are related to human traffickers bringing illegal aliens into the United States:Jalopnik   In July 2013, Authorities in Mexico charged a truck driver with human trafficking after discovering 94 people in his vehicle headed to the United States.A report from Reuters says that the 94 people packed into a truck were found near the southern city of Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of the state of Chiapas. Among them were 19 people from Bangladesh and Nepal, as well as Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. They were detected in an X-ray scan Monday night outside Tuxtla Gutierrez.Officials say the migrants were kept in inhumane conditions.

NYC MAYOR DE BLASIO Blasted by Queens Woman…He Runs Away! [Video],"Vickie Paladino and her husband were driving through their neighborhood when they spotted the mayor. Paladino was so upset over de Blasio s trip to Germany to speak at a G-20 protest in lieu of attending a vigil for slain New York police officer Miosotis Familia that she left the car to berate him.As de Blasio approached her and a group of others to shake hands, she started to ask about his trip. He turned around with his security detail and went to his car. I want to know why you let your police officers down and our country down by going to Germany and protesting against our country,  she yelled at de Blasio.  I want to know why you re doing that. OK? I don t care about the trees. We ll work it out. ADVERTISINGCBS reporter Marcia Kramer had a scathing assessment of de Blasio, who she said  simply fled  when Paladino started her criticism. The woman in the white shirt single-handedly brought WrestleMania to the streets of Whitestone, Queens, but her opponent Bill de Blasio was no Hulk Hogan or The Rock,  Kramer said.  He was more like the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard Of Oz. Paladino caught the attention of the media assembled for the event, and she told reporters that she d  had it  with de Blasio and doubted he had a friend in the city. This is got to do with a liberal, socialist mayor who is running our city and has no regard for our country,  she said. Why did you go to Germany? Why did you stand with the communists, with the anarchists, with the socialists when you re supposed to be here, taking care of our business, our police officers,  she said in a later interview with Kramer.",politics,"Jul 23, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"HILARIOUS! Leonardo DiCaprio Is “Outed” As Climate Change Hypocrite, Forced To Do The Unimaginable","Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the most outspoken advocates for man-made global climate-change in America, he is also of the biggest hypocrites. Thanks to alternative news sources,  DiCaprio has been  outed  more than once for his extravagant energy- wasting lifestyle. The lifestyles of climate change advocates like DiCaprio and Al Gore are being questioned every day by reasonable people who want to know why these self-appointed climate change czars are asking everyday citizens to adjust the way they live, while these hypocrites continue to travel by jet or on board massive private yachts with absolutely no reasonable explanation.It looks like DiCaprio is sick and tired of being called a  hypocrite  and has traded in the private jets in favor of doing the unimaginable traveling with the common man on a commercial flight.Leo DiCaprio is currently shoring up environmentally friendly plans for his foundation s annual gala and auction in St-Tropez, sources tell us.We hear that the star is ditching any private jets and will fly commercial to the glitzy French f te on Wednesday.  NYPPerhaps DiCaprio doesn t want to be the laughing stock of the climate change crowd again this year, like last year when he was caught making several trips across the world by private jets to attend glitzy climate-change events.In May 2016, Leonardo DiCaprio took a private jet twice to pick up an environmental award in New York   before flying back to a glitzy gala in France.The actor and environmentalist, 41, was spotted in Cannes, where the Film Festival is currently underway.But he left the French Riviera for a brief trip to New York City, where he collected an honor at the Riverkeeper Fishermen s Ball on Wednesday, Page Six reported.He then hopped back on another private jet to attend the amfAR gala in Antibes, about eight miles from Cannes, just 24 hours later.DiCaprio has been accused of hypocrisy as he can often be heard preaching about saving the environment and fighting climate change   while taking private jets to do so.The actor, who turned his Oscars speech into a pressing warning against climate change in February, accumulated more than 8,000 of air travel in just a couple of days.

Right?Waters told Reid: Just because I m going to New Hampshire to be at a Democratic Party event for one of my colleagues, they made this story up. , or to make people uncomfortable with me, all of that.

MEDIA SILENT: President Trump Makes Americans $4 TRILLION Richer In First 6 Months…Compare To Obama’s Radical First 6 Months In Office,"It s Thursday, July 20th. As of today, Donald Trump has been president for 6 months. The media coverage of the president is overwhelmingly negative: the press remains contemptuous, and they re pushing to get him out before he completes his first term.Investors might think differently. The great success of the Trump presidency thus far, is not what he s done, but what he promises to do, namely, get the economy going again. Evidently, investors believe he might yet get it done.Look at this: since his election win, the Trump rally has added $4.1 trillion to the nation s wealth. Anyone with a 401k, an IRA, college savings, retirement savings, mutual funds. Anyone with a dime in the market has taken a piece of that $4 trillion.   Fox NewsWhile President Trump has been incredibly busy working with American businesses and cutting trade deals with foreign leaders to benefit American businesses and workers, the media intentionally ignores his accomplishments, and focuses instead, on a manufactured Russian-collusion story.  Compare President Trump s first successful 6 months in office to those of media darling Barack Obama:From siding with terrorists hell-bent on destroying Israel, to ensuring federal funds could be used for abortion, to adding 17,000 more troops to a war Obama promised he would end, the first 2 months of Obama s presidency were about as anti-American as our nation has ever seen.  Wasn t anyone in the media just a tad bit curious about Barack Obama s first act as our newly sworn in president, that placed a temporary halt on the trials for terrorists at Guantanamo Bay?20 January 2009  Obama is sworn in as the 44th president of the US  Hours after taking office, Obama requests a temporary halt to Guant namo Bay trials.21 January  Hillary Clinton is confirmed as secretary of state.22 January  The president brings in executive orders aimed at reforming the US s detention policy. He orders the closure of  black sites , where CIA and European security services have interrogated terrorist suspects. He also orders interrogations of detainees across the entire US intelligence community to adhere to the US Army Field Manual and orders the closure of the Guant namo Bay prison within 12 months.23 January- Obama orders the end of the  Mexico City Rule  which had banned federal funding of NGOs that performed abortions or offered abortion counselling. It is strongly criticised by the Vatican.26 January  Obama outlines his energy policy, saying America must become more self-sufficient and calling for an  energy economy  to create jobs. He said the US should not be a  hostage to dwindling resources, hostile regimes, and a warming planet .27 January  In his first TV interview, to the al-Arabiya network, Obama spoke of improved relations with the Middle East. On Israel, he reiterated US support but said:  I do believe the moment is ripe for both sides to realise that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people. And that instead, it s time to return to the negotiating table. 29 January  Obama signs his first bill into law, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The law ends a 2007 Supreme Court decision that said workers had only 180 days to file a pay discrimination lawsuit.5 February  The last terror trial at Guant namo Bay is halted after the judge dropped charges against a suspect in the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000.17 February  In Denver, Colorado, Obama signs into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aimed at rescuing the economy.WSJ    The $830 billion spending blowout was sold by the White House as a way to keep unemployment from rising above 8%. But the stimulus would fail on its own terms. 2009 marked the first of four straight years when unemployment averaged more than 8%. And of course the unemployment rate would have been even worse in those years and still today if so many people had not quit the labor force, driving labor-participation rates to 1970s levels. Given that Governments are generally the worst allocators of capital it should come as no real surprise that the money was squandered on non-productive investments. $783,000 was spent on a study of why young people consume malt liquor and marijuana. $92,000 went to the Army Corps of Engineers for costumes for mascots like Bobber the Water Safety Dog. $219,000 funded a study of college  hookups.' 17 February  Obama approves the sending of 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan.26 February  Obama submits to Congress a 140-page summary of his proposed budget for the next fiscal year. The budget restates his commitment to halve the federal deficit, and commits $630bn over the next 10 years to the reform of the health care system.27 February  In a speech at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina the President reaffirms his commitment to withdraw US troops from Iraq by the end of August 2010.3 March  Russia reveals it is considering an implied offer made by Obama last month to drop the US European missile defence plan in return for Russian assistance with Iran. Obama later denies the offer was made, though admits he sent the letter.By the third month of Donald Trump s presidency, the media was in full-frenzy mode over manufactured ties to President Trump and alleged hacking into our elections by the Russians. Every day, a new  unnamed source  was revealed an  unverified fact  about how Donald Trump or his administration was  allegedly  tied to Russian interference in our elections that the press believed ultimately led to Hillary Clinton s loss.  In his third anti-American month as president, the most the media could dig up on Barack Obama, was that his hair was turning grey. 5 March  Newspapers and blogs in the US are abuzz over the possibility that Obama s hair is already turning grey.9 March   The president removes restrictions on funding for stem cell research and a memorandum to protect science from political interference, reversing the Bush administration s strict policy.Barack Obama was only the President of the United States for 3 months (exactly) when he began to cozy up to Iran. At 3 months, he also began his quest to be the entertainment president, or the president who had the closest relationship to Hollywood liberals and hypocrites: 20 March   President Obama releases an historic video message for all those celebrating Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, speaking directly to the leaders of Iran.  Obama appears on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, the first time that a sitting president has appeared as a guest on a late-night talk show. Commenting on his bowling ability he joked  it was like the Special Olympics, or something . He apologises to Tim Shriver, chairman of the Special Olympics, before the programme is broadcast.24 March  Obama publishes an op-ed piece in 30 global newspapers simultaneously, discussing the economic crisis.27 March  Obama announces a new approach to Afghanistan and Pakistan.Obama famously shook the hand of brutal dictator Hugo Chavez in the month of April. The same month marked the beginning of 8 long years of Obama ignoring the North Korean nuclear threat. It was also Obama s first underreported meeting with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. One of the most reported news stories of the Obama presidency however, happened in April, when the Obama s purchased a dog for their daughters. 1 April  Obama holds a meeting with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, looking to thaw relations.No mention was made by the media of Russian collusion or who was in the meeting with Obama and the Russian president. 5 April  Hours after North Korea launched a satellite many think was a cover for missile testing, Obama speaks about an end to nuclear arms in Prague. It was his first big foreign policy speech.Obama would continue to ignore the threat posed by North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for the remainder of his presidency, leaving President Trump to deal with a much more dangerous and developed nuclear North Korea 8 years later. Obama made his first public proclamation that we are not at war with Islam on April 6th:6 April  Obama speaks to the Turkish parliament, saying the US is not fighting against Islam.7 April  Obama makes a surprise visit to troops at Camp Victory near Baghdad. In his speech he says it is time to hand over control of the country to the Iraqis, who must make political concessions first.13 April  The Obama children get their promised puppy, a six-month-old Portuguese water dog called Bo.On April 6th, Obama attempts to discredit and humiliate the Bush administration. Meanwhile, George W. Bush has quietly slipped into retirement.16 April  The president releases memos from the Bush era detailing torture methods used by the CIA; he says agents involved would not be prosecuted. Dick Cheney has since defended the methods.18 April  Obama addresses the Summit of the Americas at the opening ceremony in Trinidad and Tobago. While there he controversially shakes hands with Venezuela leader Hugo Ch vez, who gives him a copy of Open Veins of Latin America.30 April  Obama rejects waterboarding as a legitimate form of interrogation.10 May  Obama plays it for laughs at the annual White House correspondents  dinner, making a swine flu joke about Hillary Clinton and alluding to the time Dick Cheney accidentally shot his hunting buddy. Ashton Kutcher tweeted (external site) from the front row.13 May  Obama blocks the release of photographs showing torture of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan.17 May- Obama is heckled by anti-abortion campaigners during a speech at the Catholic Notre Dame university, Indiana.

The media never uttered a word about potential collusion by  unnamed sources.  July also marked the beginning of Obama s quest to force single payer health care on Americans that eventually led to the failed Obamacare that President Trump and the Republican led Congress is now responsible for repealing and replacing. Finally, the last day of Obama s 6 moths in office (July 31, 2009) will forever be known as the official start of Obama s race war on America: 6 July  Obama heads to Moscow for talks with Dmitry Medvedev, which will include discussions on how to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpiles.9 July  Obama attends the G8 summit in Italy, meeting the Pope and Muammar Gaddafi among others.21 July  Obama launches his campaign to overhaul the US healthcare system.22 July  Obama meets Iraqi president Nouri al-Maliki and confirms his intention to remove all US troops from Iraq by the end of 2010.27 July  A team of senior US officials visit Israel to negotiate for an end to Jewish settlements.31 July  Obama enjoys a beer with black Harvard professor Henry Gates and the white police officer who arrested him on suspicion of breaking into his own home, in an attempt to end the race row brewing over the incident.Obama First 6 months timeline via  The Guardian",politics,"Jul 22, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

CLEAR DISCRIMINATION: SNAP Still Gives Preference to Illegals Over American Citizens,"THE CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES is a great resource for all the facts on illegals and taxpayer dollars. Patty and I were lucky enough to attend a two-day workshop with them in DC. The main fact that stuck with us is that the current immigration system is UNSUSTAINABLE They used facts and figures to lay out the truth for us and it was frightening! This is why it is even more frightening that the feds are STILL giving preferential treatment to illegals when it comes to SNAP.CIS s David North gives us the low down:It s been six months since Donald Trump took office, and some families with illegal aliens get food stamps (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) while identical all-citizen families of the same size and with the same income do not receive them.This is not a question of treating illegal aliens like other residents of this country, it is clear-cut discrimination against citizens and in favor of illegals.This long-standing (and peculiar) arrangement is the sort of thing that one would expect to be corrected by the third, if not the first, month of a new get-tough-on-illegal-immigration administration, such as that of the campaigning Donald Trump.I checked with the Department of Agriculture s Food and Nutrition Service this week, the $110 billion-a-year agency that runs food stamps and some other nutrition programs.Two questions were on my mind: 1) does the food stamp program still, under a particular set of circumstances, operate with this anti-citizen bias, and 2) has the Trump administration made an appointment of one or more outsiders to help run the agency?The answer to the second question came quickly: No, but there is a civil servant running the program on an acting basis who was placed in that job by the White House. Does an agency have to have a budget of, say, $200 billion a year before the administration notices its existence?It took a little longer to get the answer to the first question, because the nature of the discrimination is subtle and a lot of professionals in the welfare business do not want to make the distinction between legal and illegal residents of this country.Here s how the system works: Illegal aliens are not allocated food stamps, but if the family is mixed, with some citizens and some illegals, the mixed family still gets some benefits. States are allowed, to some extent, to pick and choose among benefit-determination methods. Most states have chosen a technique that does not record some of the earnings of illegal aliens, while always recording all the income of citizens.Let s look at the system as applied to two similar families who live in adjacent houses; both have incomes of $2,400 a month, both have the same assets, both families consist of a working male, his stay-at-home spouse, and their stay-at-home toddler. The only difference is that one of the men is a native-born citizen and the other is an illegal alien. Everyone else in the two households is a citizen.OK, so far. Now let s walk through Alice s special mirror, and see how the government handles the situation. It sees the three-citizen family as three people and says that $2,400 a month is too high an income for food stamps. It looks at the other family and sees it as a two-member family, because the man is an illegal, and then   here s the key   the government decides that only two-thirds of the family income should be counted, and that $1,600 is not too high for a family of two, hence the family with the illegal alien in it gets food stamps and the other family does not.There are bands of income in which this situation plays out with different sized families, giving benefits to some mixed families, and denying them to all-citizen families of the same size and with the same income. For more on these strange arrangements, see the CIS report  An Aid Program that Routinely Discriminates in Favor of Ineligible Aliens .That s the way it was under Obama, and after I explained the (admittedly bizarre) matter to the Food and Nutrition Service publicist, she told me that it remains that way under Trump.This story is symptomatic of two larger realities. Both the Obama and Trump administrations managed to conduct big immigration operations to their own liking; think of DACA with Obama, and, under Trump, the way that enforcement people were given the freedom to do their jobs.But Obama was much more successful in the minutia of immigration policy than Trump; for years I wrote about this little move to admit a small class of migrants, or that little move that prevented another subclass from being deported. We are not seeing that, or maybe not yet, with the Trump administration. You can t change policy, at least at the retail level, without people to write and push the new policies.So an unknown but substantial number of mixed (illegals plus citizens) families are getting food stamps when equally poor neighbors, who happen to be in all-citizen families, go hungry.Read more and please check out the CIS websiteJESSICA VAUGHAN OF CIS DISCUSSES EXPEDITED REMOVAL OF ILLEGALS UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION:Please use this website as a resource for facts when it comes to immigration!",politics,"Jul 22, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
LIBERAL HACK KATIE COURIC Says Fake News Is “Tearing [America] Apart”…Doesn’t Mention $12 MILLION Dollar Lawsuit Against Her For Producing Edited Story To Push Gun Control [VIDEO],"Katie Couric is a wolf in sheep s clothing. Dan Rather, Brian Williams and Katie Couric will forever be known as some of the worst liars at CBS and NBC, two of the three major news networks where most Americans used to go to get their news.Katie Couric, who still faces a $12 million defamation lawsuit stemming from a deceptive edit in a film she produced, decried the effect of fake news on America during an interview on Thursday.Couric told the New York Daily News she believes fake news is  tearing [America] apart at the seams  while discussing her latest effort cohosting a music and politics event in New York City.  I remember I got sent a lot of stories from friends who were quite educated and were like,  Did you see this?'  Couric said.  And I would say,  Come on, you re kidding, right? This is BS.' She did not mention the controversy surrounding a deceptive edit included in her 2016 film Under the Gun. During one scene in the movie Couric is shown asking a group of gun rights activists from the Virginia Citizens Defense League a question about background checks. The group is then shown sitting in silence for nine seconds with nobody offering a response to the question.  WFBListen to Rush Limbaugh explain why Katie Couric is  not a good person  and  not a nice woman :The makers of a new Katie Couric documentary on gun violence deceptively edited an interview between Couric and a group of gun rights activists in an apparent attempt to embarrass the activists, an audio recording of the full interview shows.At the 21:48 mark of Under the Gun a scene of Katie Couric interviewing members of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun rights organization, is shown.Couric can be heard in the interview asking activists from the group,  If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun? The documentary then shows the activists sitting silently for nine awkward seconds, unable to provide an answer. It then cuts to the next scene. The moment can be watched here:However, raw audio of the interview between Katie Couric and the activists provided to the Washington Free Beacon shows the scene was deceptively edited. Instead of silence, Couric s question is met immediately with answers from the activists. A back and forth between a number of the league s members and Couric over the issue of background checks proceeds for more than four minutes after the original question is asked.LISTEN HERE:John Lott, Jr. explains to The Blaze s Dana Loesch how this  documentary  was rigged from the outset:Under the Gun has been labeled  dishonest politicking in the guise of media coverage,   loose with the facts,  and  a full-length assault on guns and the Second Amendment  by those in the gun community since its debut on May 15.The Virginia Citizens Defense League labeled the deceptively edited segment featured in the film  unbelievable and extremely unprofessional.  Philip Van Cleave, the organization s president, said the editing was done deliberately to make it appear that league members didn t have a response to Couric s question. Katie Couric asked a key question during an interview of some members of our organization,  he said.  She then intentionally removed their answers and spliced in nine seconds of some prior video of our members sitting quietly and not responding. Viewers are left with the misunderstanding that the members had no answer to her question. Nora Ryan, the chief of staff for EPIX, the cable channel that is airing the documentary, told the Free Beacon in an email,  Under the Gun is a critically-acclaimed documentary that looks at the polarizing and politicized issue of gun violence, a subject that elicits strong reactions from people on both sides. EPIX stands behind Katie Couric, director Stephanie Soechtig, and their creative and editorial judgment. We encourage people to watch the film and decide for themselves.

KID ROCK’S INTERVIEW With Piers Morgan Sheds Light On Why Democrats Fear His Run For U.S. Senate [VIDEO],"Former MI Supreme Court Justice and black conservative Bob Young has officially thrown his hat in the Senate race.Firebrand Lena Epstein, female Jewish business owner, Harvard grad, and former co-chair of the MI Trump campaign, has also officially announced her run against Debbie Stabenow. Unlike Kid Rock, who initially got behind Dr. Ben Carson for President, Epstein was in Trump s camp from day one.Last week, Kid Rock sent shockwaves through the political world when he announced his run against Senator Stabenow in the 2018 election.One thing these candidates all have in common is that they all support and align themselves with President Donald Trump, who broke the Democrat stronghold on Michigan voters that s plaguing the state since 1992.Kid Rock did an interview with liberal former CNN host Piers Morgan in 2013. During that interview, it s clear that Bob Ritchie, aka Kid Rock, who is a rock star in more ways that one in the state of Michigan, has many similarities to President Donald Trump.Piers Morgan starts out his interview by pointing out that after he and Kid Rock spent several hours together during his interview, when Rock was asked about his time with Piers, he responded,  Who the (bleep) is Piers Morgan? , giving the impression that the leftist media doesn t really have much value in his eyes, or at the very least, he doesn t hold them in very high regard.Watch:Part II of Kid Rock s interview with Piers Morgan delves into Rock s political views on gun control, abortion, gay marriage and his support for the Republican Party. Although his pro-choice stance won t likely resonate with many Republicans, there will be a number of pro-choice Republicans as well as crossover Democrats and pro-life Independents his pro-choice stance will appeal to. He also touches on Rock s decision to raise his son Robert James Ritchie Jr. by himself, that he fathered with his on again, off again girlfriend he d been dating since the 8th grade.Piers Morgan was enamored by Kid Rock s desire to reduce ticket prices for his concerts so he make a difference by allowing the everyday blue-collar worker to attend his concerts. Piers can t seem to wrap his brain around the fact that a very successful and wealthy entertainer is actually willing to give up a portion of his profit to help out his fans.  Kid Rock doesn t just talk about how he cares about the little guy like Jay Z, Beyonce and Katy Perry, he actually did something to help them out.Piers also asks Kid Rock about his drug use. This is where Trump and Kid Rock are nothing alike. President Trump is not and has never been a drug user, after his older brother died of alcohol abuse related complications, Trump made a decision to never have a drink again.",politics,"Jul 22, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

RADICAL UNHINGED TEACHER Finally Arrested and Charged in California [Video],"Please note that this unhinged woman is a middle school teacher!After an eight-month investigation, Yvette Felarca, a middle school teacher in Berkeley, was arrested and charged this week with assault and rioting at a rally in Sacramento last summer. As it turns out, when she s not filling the minds of impressionable early teens, Felarca is punching  Nazis. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuWoQfZgW7MFelarca, 47, is the leader of the fascist antifa group By Any Means Necessary and they were on hand in June 2016 to counter protest a permitted rally by the Traditionalist Worker Party at the California state capitol building. As fists flew, smart phones recorded and caught Felarca punching a man repeatedly in his stomach and yelling at him to  get the f*** off our streets.  What she started, her fascist friends finished, jumping the guy and beating him on the ground before police stepped in.Now, the Sacramento County District Attorney s Office charged her with inciting and participating in a riot and assault likely to cause great bodily injury. Luckily, she was one of the counter-protesters who didn t cover her face, making her easy to identify. Over 300 fascists showed up that day to intimidate 30 members of the worker party who had a permit to be there.Fox News reports:In addition to the June clash, Felarca has been prominent at several other events involving the Occupy movement, and more recently between supporters and opponents of President Trump and other conservative leaders.She was also among the people who protested Milo Yiannopoulos  appearance at UC Berkeley earlier this year. During an appearance on Fox News after the protests, she said she was obligated to shut down his  racist, misogynistic and homophobic  messages.Here s her appearance shortly after the Berkeley riot being indignant and unapologetic with Tucker Carlson:There were others charged in the riot which included multiple assaults and stabbings. However, it was nowhere near the number the California Highway patrol tallied in a 2000-page report on the incident. In total, there were 514 misdemeanors and 68 felonies involving 101 people, according to Milo.com.Read more: Truth Feed",politics,"Jul 21, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
WHAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WON’T SHOW YOU: NEW White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci Explains Why He Once Called Trump A “Hack” [VIDEO],"The mainstream media will never show you both sides of the story, so we will In 2015, hedge fund magnate Anthony Scaramucci appeared on Fox Business Network, where he slammed  anti-American  Trump for being  another hack  who will  probably make Elizabeth Warren as his vice presidential nominee.  Scaramucci also delivered a message to Trump while he was on a roll,  You re an inherited-money dude from Queens County. Bring it, Donald. Bring it.  The mainstream media will likely play his comments on a loop, as a way to discredit President Trump and his new pick to replace the outspoken White House communications director Sean Spicer.Scarmucci s emotional comments were in response to what he perceived to be an attack by Trump on hedge fund managers. During his campaign, Trump vowed to reform the tax code to ensure that hedge fund managers paid their fair share of taxes. He called hedge fund managers  paper-pushers,  and said he would seek to help the middle-class by lowering their tax burden. The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder. They re making a tremendous amount of money. They have to pay taxes. I want to lower the rates for the middle class. The middle class is the one, they re getting absolutely destroyed. This country doesn t have won t have a middle class very soon.  Trump told CBS News.After the announcement was made today about the changing of the guard in the White House communication department, Scaramucci appeared on FOX to explain his position. The video below shows the disparaging comments about candidate Donald J. Trump that Scaramucci made on FOX Business Network in 2015, as well as a clip from today showing Scaramucci putting his remarks into context that he made when he was admittedly an  unexperienced person in the world of politics . In addition to apologizing profusely for his misguided remarks, Scaramucci also admitted that he was  supporting another candidate  at the time he made the comments about Donald J. Trump.Watch:.@Scaramucci called @POTUS a hack in 2015.He has publicly apologized today. MSM may choose not to show his apology.

JOHN MCCAIN ATTACKS President Trump From Hospital Bed Only Days After Brain Cancer Diagnosis,"Senator John McCain just couldn t help himself. While millions of Americans were praying for his recovery, after he was diagnosed with brain cancer earlier this week, McCain took to Twitter to admonish President Trump over his decision to end a failed program that was supposed to train, fund and arm Syrians to fight Assad and ISIS.The program has been a complete failure and cost Americans millions of dollars.The Hill  In February, 2012, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who both serve on the Senate Armed Services committee urged that the United States arm opposition forces in Syria. War-hawks McCain and Graham argued that arming rebel fighters in the country could help beat back a Syrian government with close ties to Iran. Breaking Syria apart from Iran could be as important to containing a nuclear Iran as sanctions,  Graham said at a press conference in Kabul, according to the New York Times.  If the Syrian regime is replaced with another form of government that doesn t tie its future to the Iranians, the world is a better place. Where have we heard that strategy before? Oh yeah in Libya and in Iraq. How did that work out for America and for the Middle East John? McCain was apparently well enough by yesterday to warn tweeted his  sparring partners  in Congress that he d  be back soon  and told them to  stand-by!  Goodness knows, America couldn t survive without the votes and guidance of Trump-hater and leader of the Republican  we don t have to do what the American voters elected us to do  opposition party.I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support   unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I'll be back soon, so stand-by!

The country had only just legalized the practice in 2016, paving the way for a more family-friendly environment in Australian politics.Waters was born in Winnipeg in 1977 to two Australian parents and moved down under when she was just 11 months old. Australia s constitution forbids anyone with dual citizenship from serving as a senator. Waters, who says she was unaware that she held citizenship in Canada, was elected in 2010. I was devastated to learn that because of 70-year-old Canadian laws I had been a dual citizen from birth, and that Canadian law changed a week after I was born and required me to have actively renounced Canadian citizenship,  Waters said at a press conference today.

She s a formidable enemy, but weak in the sense that where she s fundamentally coming from, her basis of where she s coming from, has massive weakness and I know how to expose that weakness. Ayyadurai, 53, moved to the U.S. from India as a child. He compared the Democratic senator and former Harvard University professor to those at the top of India s caste system   a social structure in which he said his family held a low position. If you look at what we have today, we have a neo-caste system and at the top of that heap is people like Warren,  he said.  They are the academics, career politicians and lawyer/lobbyists. And that clan   is extremely spineless, they never expect to be challenged. And I ve challenged them. Last month, Ayyadurai made news when he sent Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren a DNA kit for her birthday (which she rejected) after Warren was caught lying about being a Native American on a application for a teaching position at Harvard University, allegedly hoping that her fake minority status would place her ahead of other applicants for the job.Senator Elizabeth Warren is not only a liar, she s also not very bright. Warren sent out an email today that was clearly designed to appeal to women. In the email, Warren names the very unpopular Hillary Clinton, not only once, but twice. Warren starts out the email by mentioning Hillary s name in the first sentence:Hillary Clinton said that  it takes a village,  and she was right.  None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community, or lift a country totally alone. Warren used Hillary s name again near the end of her email:Every minute counts to get a campaign off the ground. It mattered the most when the DSCC helped launch my Senate campaign, and when they were there for Hillary when she launched her Senate career 17 years ago.Apparently, Warren missed the dreadful polls showing how the wildly unpopular Hillary Clinton s like ability continues to plummet, even after the race.If Warren stays the course and continues to align herself with Crooked Hillary, the very successful entrepreneur and President Trump supporter Shiva Ayyadurai will no doubt be able to use her embarrassingly bad decision to his advantage.Mass Live- If elected, Ayyadurai said he hopes to bring a sense of innovation to the Senate when it comes to addressing hot-button issues, as well as to look at problems from an engineering and science perspective.Casting himself as a  Lincoln Republican,  the entrepreneur said his campaign platform will largely focus on three areas: immigration, education and innovation.As an immigrant, Ayyadurai said he believes it is important that the U.S. secure its borders, root out so-called sanctuary cities and ensure people enter the country legally.He added that he also supports ensuring parents and students have choices when it comes to public education, and argued that more must be done to address what he called  pay-to-play  academic science research.Ayyadurai, who holds four degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the founder and chairman of CytoSolve, a startup that has developed a  computational platform for scalable integration of molecular pathway models  used in drug development.He is one of three Republicans who have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for the Massachusetts Senate seat in 2018.To donate to Shiva Ayyadurai s senate campaign, click HERE.Here is Warren s email:Friend  Hillary Clinton said that  it takes a village,  and she was right.  None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community, or lift a country totally alone. I ve seen what a village, a community, and a movement can do, one action at a time. And I ve seen how women can help women   especially when we run for office.I sure remember what it was like running for the Senate as a first-time candidate in 2011. I had to learn everything it took to raise money, build a grassroots organizing operation, and stand up to a Republican incumbent with $10 million in the bank   and I had to do it fast.And here s what I know: I absolutely, positively couldn t have done it on my own.So when the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee told me they wanted a strong launch of the Women s Senate Network for the 2018 cycle, to help women run and make sure more voices like mine and Hillary s are in the Senate, I immediately told them:I m all in.Today, I m asking you to join me in becoming a 2018 founding member of the DSCC Women s Senate Network. Because you were there for Hillary, I m hoping you ll add your name to help us build a community to support women who run for office.Now let me be blunt: 2018 is going to be a hard year for Democrats. We ve got 10 women who are up for reelection to the Senate, including me   more than ever before in history. And many are in some really tough races.That s why the DSCC s Women s Senate Network is ramping up its 2018 efforts early to elect and protect smart, tough, and experienced candidates to fight for what s right   senators who understand that being a woman is not a pre-existing condition, that we deserve equal pay for equal work, and that we sure as heck need Planned Parenthood and affordable health care for hardworking families.Let s continue our fight and get more women in leadership in this country.I m counting on you to keep fighting for what we all started: become a 2018 founding member of the DSCC Women s Senate Network today. You ll even get your very own  Nevertheless, She Persisted  sticker when you do!Every minute counts to get a campaign off the ground. It mattered the most when the DSCC helped launch my Senate campaign, and when they were there for Hillary when she launched her Senate career 17 years ago.And with your help, we can be there for the women who need help defending their seats now and for the next generation of women candidates ready to move into leadership. Early help makes all the difference.Thank you for owning a piece of this.Elizabeth ",politics,"Jul 20, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
NEW EMAILS REVEAL HUMA ABEDIN Told to “Show Love” to Clinton Donors…Clinton’s Brother Acted As Go-Between,"Judicial Watch has released documents obtained in response to a court order including emails that show a pay to play game going on between the Clintons and donors: A number of emails show the free flow of information and requests for favors between Clinton s State Department and the Clinton Foundation. What s even more disturbing is the lack of concern for national security in the heavily redacted emails:The heavily redacted documents from Abedin s non-government account include an email from Hillary Clinton s brother, Tony Rodham, to Abedin revealing that he acted as a go-between for a Clinton Foundation donor, Richard Park. And they reveal Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band instructing Abedin to  show love  to Clinton donor Andrew Liveris.The documents included six Clinton email exchanges not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date to at least 439 emails that were not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department, and further contradicting a statement by Clinton that,  as far as she knew,  all of her government emails had been turned over to the State Department.The documents are in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015, lawsuit filed against the State Department (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) for:  All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non- state.gov  email address. A number of emails show the free flow of information and requests for favors between Clinton s State Department and the Clinton Foundation.In July 2009, in reference to the US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Clinton Global Initiative head Doug Band told Abedin that she  Need[s] to show love  to Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow Chemical. Band also asked for Liveris to be introduced to Hillary,  and have her mention both me and wjc . Dow gave between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Band also pushes for Clinton to do a favor for Karlheinz Koegel, a major Clinton Foundation contributor, who wanted Hillary Clinton to give the  honor speech  for his media prize to  Merkel. The emails reveal that on June 19, 2009, Clinton s brother, Tony Rodham, passed a long a letter for Hillary Clinton for Clinton donor Richard Park. Park donated $100,000 to Bill Clinton as far back as 1993 and is listed by the Clinton Foundation as a $100,000 to $250,000 donor Read more: Judicial Watch",politics,"Jul 20, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
JESSE WATTERS NAILS IT: You Can’t Drain the Swamp if Your Own Party is “Plugging the Holes” [Video],"Jesse Watters: GOP can t drain the swamp when their own members are plugging the hole. Jesse Watters made an excellent point about Republicans and their failure to repeal Obamacare. The GOP can t seem to get out of its own way. The GOP can t drain the swamp when their own members are standing in the way.Watters nailed it! This is so on point!MSNBC s Joy Reid confirmed what Watters said when she commented on the three women Watters mentioned and called them the  resistance  to Trump:Wednesday on MSNBC s  Deadline: White House,  network host Joy Reid said Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV) stalled efforts in the Senate to repeal Obamacare because they are  leading kind of the resistance  to President Donald Trump. (video below)Reid said,  When it comes to politics I think it s such a man s world for so long it s so much of politics driven by men telling women what s best for them. And that has not caught up to the 21st century in a lot of ways. I think the most glaring spectacle we have seen is this 13 member, all male, all white commission deciding what s best for health care, including women s health care. She continued,  These three Republican women are saying no. And these three Republican women are leading kind of the resistance to the bill, even within the GOP. I honestly have to say that, Nicolle, on the trail last year covering the campaign I noticed among white women, in particular, there was not a drive a see a woman in the White House for its own sake. But after the election, suddenly women are saying, wait a minute. We are being taken advantage of. And women are stepping up a little bit as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udw2WHtnsqo",politics,"Jul 20, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

BREAKING NEWS: Senator John McCain Diagnosed With Brain Cancer…Same Tumor Killed Senator Kennedy,"The McCain family has requested everyone s prayers Sen. John McCain, 80, has been diagnosed with a primary glioblastoma, a type of brain tumor, Mayo Clinic doctors directly involved in the senator s care told CNN.The senator underwent surgery to remove a blood clot on Friday at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix. Lab results from that surgery confirmed the presence of glioblastoma associated with the blood clot.Glioblastoma is a particularly aggressive tumor that forms in the tissue of the brain and spinal cord, according to the American Brain Tumor Association.A pathologist was in the operating room during the procedure, a minimally invasive craniotomy with an eyebrow incision, said his doctor, who added that the surgery lasted about 3 to 4 hours. Post-surgical brain scans show the tissue causing concern has been completely removed.McCain is recovering  amazingly well,  according to a statement from his office.The senator showed no neurological problems before or after the operation, said his doctors. Though not identified by name, at McCain s request, his doctors were given permission speak with Gupta, who is also a practicing neurosurgeon.McCain is now recovering at his Arizona home. He and his family are considering treatment options, which will likely include radiation and chemotherapy, his doctors said.The surgical procedure McCain underwent is  a significant operation,  said Gupta, explaining that a bone underneath the eyebrow had to be removed to do the procedure and then later put back. It s a very aggressive tumor,  said Gupta. He explained that survival for malignant glioblastoma tends to be around 14 months with treatment, which could not begin until the incision heals, which would be in the next three or four weeks.However, a 2009 study reported that almost 10% of patients with glioblastoma may live five years or longer, according to the American Brain Tumor Association. This is the same tumor that Ted Kennedy had,  said Gupta.  My Fox 8Senator Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant glioma in May 2008, after being hospitalized following a seizure. A month later, he underwent what was described as  successful  surgery at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, and then received both chemotherapy and radiation after returning home to Massachusetts.Six months after the diagnosis, Senator Kennedy had returned to the Capitol and was working part-time while still continuing with treatment.Senator Kennedy died on August 25, 2009.

BREAKING: John McCain Diagnosed With Brain Cancer,"News broke a few days ago that there was more to the reported minor outpatient removal of a blood clot above John McCain s eye. Suspicion has been growing that the surgery was more serious but we now know that it s as bad as it gets. Senator John McCain has been diagnosed with brain cancer. Please pray for Senator McCain and his family. No matter what side of the aisle you re on, this is tragic.A brief statement had been released after the surgery saying McCain was  in good spirits and recovering comfortably at home with this family. :TONIGHT S UPDATE IS BAD NEWS:Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, has been diagnosed with brain cancer, according to a statement released Wednesday evening by Mayo Clinic. According to the office, the cancer was discovered after some surgery last week to remove a blood clot above his left eye.  Subsequent tissue pathology revealed that a primary brain tumor known as a glioblastoma was associated with the blood clot,  the statement said. The senator s overall health is fine and he is  recovering from his surgery amazingly well,  his office said.  The Senator and his family are reviewing further treatment options with the Mayo Clinic care team. Treatment options may include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.Many questions have been left unanswered, including whether McCain had symptoms that prompted doctors to look for the clot. In June, his somewhat confused questioning of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, led to concerns about his mental status, which he later jokingly dismissed by saying he had stayed up too late watching baseball the night before. Below is the video of McCain s questioning of Comey:Senator McCain has a history of melanoma, an aggressive skin cancer that can spread to the brain. McCain had a previous surgery to remove melanoma on his temple and his arm.Via: WT",politics,"Jul 19, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
DETROIT: IMMIGRANT STEALS $132 MILLION From Medicare…Owns $7 Million Mansion With Indoor Basketball Court…Defense Lawyer Mohammed Nasser Says He’s “Not a flight risk”,"A health care executive cheated Medicare out of $132 million and blew the money on a $7 million Franklin mansion and courtside NBA tickets, and stuffed secret storage units with cash, prosecutors allege.Federal court records and prosecutors provided new details about the inner workings and riches of a health-care fraud conspiracy that ranks among the largest in Detroit history, orchestrated by 37-year-old businessman Mashiyat Rashid. Prosecutors say the conspiracy involved recruiting homeless people as patients, sending phony bills to Medicare, subjecting drug addicts to unnecessary back injections and prescribing powerful pain medication that ended up being sold on the street.The conspiracy generated so much money that Rashid withdrew $500,000 from a bank this month and stuffed the cash in a duffel bag, the government said. A surveillance team of federal agents watched him enter and leave the bank. This was a crime of deceit. His fraud was brazen,  Justice Department trial attorney Jacob Foster said Wednesday during Rashid s bond hearing.  This was about the thousands and thousands of beneficiaries who were taken advantage of in order for (Rashid) to line his pockets. Rashid, who lives in West Bloomfield Township, faces up to life in federal prison if convicted of crimes including health-care fraud conspiracy, money laundering and receiving kickbacks.Rashid is not a flight risk or a criminal, defense lawyer Mohammed Nasser said. He is a venture capitalist and business owner who paid $2.4 million in taxes last year. Rashid moved to the U.S. from Bangladesh when he was 3 years old, graduated from the University of Michigan, is married and has two young children. He doesn t have as much as a speeding ticket,  Nasser said.  He has had absolutely no involvement with the criminal justice system. This is his first parlay into the gamut of criminal law. We are confident this will be resolved. Rashid is a flight risk, U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Stafford said, noting his international travel, ties to Bangladesh and assets. She ordered Rashid held without bond pending an Aug. 22 trial. This is a uniquely troubling case in a lot of ways,  Stafford said.  The allegation is he basically forced people who may have been addicted to drugs to have unnecessary injections in their back as part of this scheme   things of that nature are very troubling. For entire story: Detroit NewsThe indictment unsealed Wednesday alleges the seven defendants conspired in a scheme involving $131.8 million.The alleged scheme involved paying kickbacks and bribes for services billed to Medicare.Only one of the seven people charged is an Ohio resident, the other six are MI residents. It has not yet been reported if the other six men are also immigrants: Mashiyat Rashid of Oakland County. Yasser Mozeb of Oakland County. Spilios Pappas of Ohio. Abdul Haq of Washtenaw County.

US POSTAL SERVICE IN HOT WATER: Broke Law Allowing Employees To Work For Clinton Campaign [Video],"How corrupt is this? The USPS allowed employees to work for Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton. Can you imagine if candidate Trump did this? There would be hell to pay!The U.S. Postal Service spent $90,000 on overtime to cover for employees who took time off to campaign in advance of the 2016 election, according to a new report. In other words, the American taxpayers made a donation of $90K to the Clinton campaign!Employees at all levels were involved and focused on key battleground states like Florida and Nevada! The OSC determined the USPS  engaged in systemic violations  of the Hatch Act, a federal law that limits certain political activities of federal employees. While employees are allowed to do some political work on leave, the report said the Postal Service showed a  bias  favoring the union s 2016 campaign operation.The investigation was launched months ago after Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., brought constituent complaints to the OSC in October. The constituent, identified as a USPS employee, was concerned the Postal Service  incurred unnecessary overtime costs  and  improperly coordinated  with the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) when it released members for several weeks of  union official  leave without pay to participate in campaign work. The Labor 2016 program sought to  elect Hillary Clinton and pro-worker candidates across the country,  the report said, citing campaign work like door-to-door canvassing, phone banks and other get-out-the-vote efforts.According to the report, roughly 97 NALC members requested the leave without pay to participate. The NALC, which endorsed Clinton last June, compensated those USPS workers using the Letter Carrier Political Fund, the union s PAC.Postal workers are allowed to take unpaid holidays but government employees aren t supposed to actively campaign for a candidate. The Inspector General is currently investigating whether the postal workers who took time off violated that precept.",politics,"Jul 19, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
SICK! NY Attorney General With Ties To Hillary Goes After Female 9-11 Survivor For Trying To Change Women’s Minds On Aborting Their Babies,"Less than one month before the 2016 presidential election, the New York State s attorney general s office ordered the Trump foundation to cease and desist fundraising activities in the state, and said calls for a similar investigation into the family foundation of Trump s opponent, Hillary Clinton, are without merit.A Trump campaign spokesman accused Schneiderman of being a  partisan hack  for investigating the Trump foundation, saying it amounted to  nothing more than another left-wing hit job.  The two have sparred publicly in the past over Schneiderman s investigation of Trump s defunct real estate academy, Trump University.Schneiderman said concerns about the Clinton Foundation s fundraising did not rise to the level of an investigation.He said compliance issues with the Clintons  foundation amounted to  ministerial, routines stuff  such as late filings or missing paperwork, and that the foundation  is properly registered and properly filed,  unlike Trump s foundation.Critics of the Clinton Foundation have called for an examination of the hundreds of millions of dollars from individuals who met with the then-secretary of state after either donating or promising to donate in the future, which included funding from foreign governments.   PoliticoDespite his best efforts, President Trump won the election. Liberal hacktivist NY State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has now turned his attention on bullying and eliminating the free speech rights of 9/11 survivor and pro-life preacher Angela Braxton.The Thomas More Law Center has announced they will defend Braxton against the pro-life bully and Democrat activist, NY State AG Eric Schneiderman.Ms. Braxton, whose iconic photo as a survivor of the 9/11 World Trade Center Terrorist Attack hangs in the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, is one of fourteen pro-life sidewalk counselors sued by the Attorney General who alleges they harassed and intimidated women at the entrance of an abortion facility, Choices Women s Medical Center, in Jamaica, New York.The Attorney General petitioned the Court to create a sixteen-foot buffer zone around the abortion premises and levy fines, attorney fees and compensatory damages against the defendants.Braxton, who did not consider herself very spiritual at the time, had a life-changing experience on 9/11 when the first plane struck while she was on the 80th floor of World Trade Center 1. Looking back on that fateful day, Angela recalls:She did not die. A few years later she fully committed herself to Jesus Christ and the pro-life cause.Jay Combs, the Thomas More Law Center attorney handling the matter, commented:Rather than fulfill his duty as Attorney General to protect the First Amendment rights of Angela Braxton, the Attorney General, in his press conference, lamented what he called  a sense of entitlement by protestors to run their mouth.  This chilling statement shows that the New York Attorney General is so blinded by his desire to see abortions performed that he has forgotten that the  entitlement  to speak on behalf of the lives of unborn children is a constitutional right protected by the First Amendment.",politics,"Jul 19, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

"WOMAN HOSPITALIZED, UNABLE TO FEEL HER LEGS After FEMALE SOMALI IMMIGRANT Attacks Her For Walking “Unclean” Dogs","Liberals would like everyone to believe that Muslims who immigrate from the Middle East to the West are interested in becoming part of the communities where they live. Nothing could be further from the truth. The attack on an innocent woman walking her dogs by a young Muslim woman, who considered her dogs to be  unclean , reminds us of how diametrically opposed our cultures truly are, and how things will never be the same again for these  welcoming  communities.A middle aged woman had to be hospitalised in Vienna following a brutal beating in broad daylight by a veiled Somali asylum seeker offended by her pet dogs.The victim, named only as Ingrid T., described how she was talking with neighbours at the gate of her garden, accompanied by dogs   her deaf, almost-blind, three-legged Collie mix  sitting peacefully  alongside while 10-month-old  Poco  meandered along an alleyway towards her parents  house   when she  saw a pretty, veiled woman approaching slowly. I knew some people from these countries do not like dogs, so I went to Poco and wanted to pull him back,  the 54-year-old told Krone from her hospital bed in the Austrian capital.The 18-year-old Somali asserted,  The animals are unclean,  Ingrid recalled, stating that her attacker then  grabbed me, spun me around and scratched me  until both women fell to the floor.It took the efforts of three men to manage to pull the asylum seeker away from the Austrian dog owner, who told Krone the assault left her unable to feel her legs.Staff at Wilhelminen Hospital had to operate twice on Ingrid who   her knee smashed in the attack   required an artificial knee to be surgically implanted.The Vienna native told Krone she believed her ordeal came about as a result of clashing cultures, revealing that she had heard the Somali s husband say:  We don t want dogs   they are filthy! With her recovery expected to take a long time, and the migrant attacker lacking any type of liability insurance, Ingrid s lawyer said it is unclear who will pay for damages caused, and noted  This will probably be a precedent.

The tweet links to a game in which the player can, as O Donnell says, make the president jump off a cliff, again and again.Conservatives expressed outrage as O Donnell s weekend tweet came to their attention.Sean Hannity s blog referred to the game as  gross  and  sick.

NEWT GINGRICH: Boost the Economy with This or There’s a ‘Real Danger of Speaker Pelosi’ [Video],"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich issued a dire warning to Republicans to focus on economic growth or else Nancy Pelosi will return to the Speaker s chair. Gingrich suggested a  large tax cut  by Thanksgiving that would be retroactive .@newtgingrich:  If we don t have economic growth next year, I think we re in real danger of having Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.  #Hannity pic.twitter.com/MfBOFraI0V  Fox News (@FoxNews) July 18, 2017Gingrich suggested:  They have got to pass by Thanksgiving, and get signed into law, by Thanksgiving, a very large tax cut, retroactively designed back to January 1 to make sure that we have enough economic growth in 2018. That Republicans can run as the party of prosperity, of jobs, of higher take home pay, and of economic growth. Next, Gingrich dropped the bomb:  If we don t have economic growth next year, I think we re in real danger of having Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019. Trump has been focusing on job growth during his term. He just announced  Made in America  week to promote American jobs and manufacturing in the US.

"THE GEORGE COSTANZA OF CNN Destroyed On His Own Show: “We have a one-party system, and the media as the other party.” [Video]","CNN Host Brian Stelter was destroyed by former NY Observer Editor Ken Kurson today on Stelter s own show! This was truly epic! Stelter calmly laid out a damning indictment of the mainstream media in the age of Trump Beautiful!Host Stelter pushed back trying to make the claim that the attacks on Trump are just harmless  opinion We all know and have watched the BRUTAL and BITTER editorializing from CNN and MSNBC. It s clearly more than that.HERE S A BIT OF THE TRANSCRIPT FROM THE KURSON/STELTER EXCHANGE:KEN KURSON: So the idea here is that the media has become the opposition to Trump. Just listening to the intro to this show, listening to Fareed s show before it, it s no longer that the Republican point of view holds forth, and the Democrats hold them accountable, and the media covers it. It s that the president and the White House put forth their point of view, the media argues with them, and the Democrats have become totally irrelevant to that discussion. It s a stunning thing to watch unfold during this presidency.BRIAN STELTER: About the irrelevancy of the Democratic party?KURSON: Totally! And the way the press has assigned itself the chore of undoing the results of this election, which they simply don t accept. And I think the shame of it is, we no longer have even a two-party system, which many think is too few. We have a one-party system, and the media as the other party.KURSON: During these breaks, when I watch you go on Twitter. The way journalists reward each other for stabbing and needling there s a new system of reward that is out there for journalists that has very little to do with policy and very little to do with advancing this country.STELTER: Where do you go from that to, the media is the opposition.KURSON: Because when I look at the tone, and the way these attacks are launched, and I ve cited a couple of examples for you, or the way that whenever there s a need for the appearance of balance, NPR will hire some conservative who hates the president. Or the New York Times will go get Bret Stephens, whose main contribution is that he hates the president.Whenever there s the need for the appearance of fairness, there s no real effort to   where are the pro-Trump journalists in the mainstream media? They don t exist! Because the entire mainstream media is against Trump. And that I think is not just bad for American policy. I think it s bad for journalism.STELTER: I think a lot of journalists are against lying, are against deceit. That s where we are right now.KURSON: I m against lying and deceit. I think the function of the journalist to hold the administration accountable is a critical function enshrined in our Bill of Rights. But when you have a system where the most outrageous attack is what s rewarded with likes on Facebook and followings on Twitter, you re setting yourself up.STELTER: Those are opinion columns! Those are opinion columns!KURSON: No, they re not just opinion columns. It s reporters. And they audition for each other, and they audition for popularity.Kurson couldn t be more right! Have you noticed that since the daily White House press briefings are not televised that the questions and tone from reporters has gotten so much calmer and less dramatic? Playing for the cameras to get that gotcha moment has disappeared so the reporters are focused and civil.Wouldn t it be great if the news would return to the facts?Read more: Legal Insurrection",politics,"Jul 18, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
CHEVY CHASE ADMITS To Using Position At SNL To Push Democrats Over Republicans To Millions Of Viewers,"Comedian Mark Dice explores the influence so-called comedians have on their viewers when it comes to pushing their political views on fans. As part of his example, Dice shows his viewers a clip from a 1980 interview with leftist comedian Chevy Chase. Chase is not only unapologetic for using his position as a writer for SNL to push his liberal propaganda down the throats of unsuspecting viewers, he s actually quite arrogant about the power he believed he had over his fans on SNL.In the 1980 interview with CNN, Chevy Chase admits to using his position to affect the outcomes of the Gerald Ford   Jimmy Carter election. Chase admits to wanting to take down Gerald Ford and to promote Jimmy Carter:  I just went after him [Ford]. And uh I certainly, and obviously my leanings were Democratic and I wanted Carter in and I wanted him out. And I figured look, we re reaching millions of people uh..every weekend, so why not do it? The CNN reporter seems stunned by Chase s admission asks,  Wait a minute! You mean to tell me that in the back of your mind you were thinking,  Hey I want Carter and I m gonna make him [Ford] look bad? Chase, who seemed very pleased with his arrogant self bragged,  Oh yeah!

GOP Rep Dave Brat HUMILIATES MSNBC Host Craig Melvin Over Liberal Media Bias…Makes Melvin Wish He Never Interviewed Him [VIDEO],"Republican Congressman David Brat wasn t sitting back and waiting for MSNBC host Craig Melvin to attack him or Republican President Donald Trump. Much to the MSNBC host s surprise, Rep Brat (R-VA) immediately went on offense telling Melvin,  But non one gets to play the innocent here!  Brat went on to explain how the media funds the Democrat Party and yet they expect Americans to believe they are being  objective  when they report the news.  Brat used media donations to Hillary s presidential campaign as an example:  Hillary raised $2 billion dollars in the Hillary foundation from foreign money and CNN and all the biggies never found anything on that. The  Washington Post is great on Watergate, but they missed  Clintongate . It may be because 97% of the donations from mainstream folks (media) go to the Democrat Party. Gee I wonder if that could, ya know, influence the news at all? MSNBC host Craig Melvin attempted to blame the New York Times and Washington Post for the alleged media bias. Melvin then tried to convince his small audience that media bias doesn t exist: Even if that bias did exist   which, I mean, Dave, it doesn t   even if it did   Brat shot back:  If it exists? Now, you got to come clean with me on that one. Brat s best line in the exchange however, came near the end, when Melvin mockingly said,  All of us are in cahoots together .Brat responded:  No, you just have a systematic bias toward liberal outcomes and growing the federal government. It s okay   it s America   I don t know if it s illegal.

TRUMP: “Let Obamacare fail… I’m not going to own it.”,"In an  impromptu  White House presser during President Trump s lunch with Vice President Pence, Trump drove home how  disappointed  he is about health care:  Let Obamacare fail, it will be a lot easier. And I think we re probably in that position where we ll just let Obamacare fail. We re not going to own it. I m not going to own it. I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it. We ll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us.  Why it matters: Trump is acknowledging defeat and now, rather than support Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s push to repeal with out a replacement bill, he s decided to let Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act remain the law of the land. fast forward and McConnell s straight repeal plan collapses with 3  no votes.  The three no votes came from three women who should really be in the D column: By Tuesday afternoon, three Republican senators   all women   had come out against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s plan to push a vote on a clean Obamacare repeal bill   enough to sink it altogether. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) confirmed they would not vote for a repeal bill that delayed enacting the policy by two years.Susan Collins needs to go!President Trump also said he was  surprised  when Senators Moran and Lee came out as  No s  last night.  We thought they were in fairly good shape. For 7 years I ve been hearing repeal and replace  and when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace, we can t. We are winning the war on the border, we re decimating ISIS  we ve had a lot of victories but we haven t had a victory on health care. I m very disappointed. Once the Affordable Care Act fails, then everyone needs to  come together and fix it,  said Trump. Democrats have no ideas. They have no thought process. All they want to do is obstruct government and obstruct period. Obamacare isn t failing, it s failed. It s gone.

BOOM! ACTOR JAMES WOODS Has Hilarious Response To Angry Feminist MSNBC Host’s Criticism Of Ivanka’s “Girly” Dress,"The hate for the Trump family by the defeated liberal press is visceral MSNBC political analyst Joan Walsh, a self-proclaimed feminist, questioned what  message  Ivanka Trump was trying to send at the G20 Summit by wearing a pink  girly  dress with bows.Walsh suggested that the dress Trump chose when sitting in for her father at the summit made her look like  property  and undermined her own value. I don t mean to sound sexist, it can be dangerous to comment on what women wear, but the fact that she sat in for her father in a dress that was so incredibly ornamental was such a contradiction,  Walsh said.  In patriarchal, authoritarian societies, daughters have great value. They are property. I think it s really pretty frightening,  she continued.  It s a pink dress with big bows on the elbows that s not a dress that s made for work. MSNBC host Thomas Roberts pushed back and asked if Walsh was suggesting that women can not dress in a feminine manner and be taken seriously. You can be a feminist and be girly, we all have our girly days, but showing up, taking your father s seat in a pink dress with big bows on the sleeves is a really interesting message,  Walsh argued.   Daily Caller Ivanka Trump-Kushner can be seen wearing the beautiful pink dress in the tweet below, that MSNBC host Joan Walsh criticized.

NEW AUDIO RELEASED Moments After Muslim SOMALI-IMMIGRANT Cop Shot and Killed 40-Yr Old ‘Bride-to-Be”,"Somali immigrant and Minnesota police officer Mohamed Noor shot and killed a 40 yr. old Australian woman when they arrived at her home to respond to a call she made about a potential sexual assault near her home. Officer Noor has only been a police officer for 2 years, and although he is celebrated by the local mayor for being a Somali immigrant, he is no stranger to controversy. He currently has two open complaints that have filed against him and one that has been dismissed without any disciplinary action from the Minnesota Police Department.Many are struggling to understand why the 40-year old Australian citizen Justine Dramond, who was set to be married to a US citizen, was shot in her pajamas after calling to report a crime near her home.Zach Damond, would-step,son of Justine was interviewed a woman who identifies herself as  Bethany  and then shamelessly went on to plug the Women s March of Minnesota  before asking Zach about his deceased mother. Zach, who is understandably emotional about the murder of father s fianc , tells  Bethany  that  America sucks  and  F*ck the police.  Zach clarified his statement saying, Some of you are good, but like I m just done. I m so done. This has to stop. This has to stop. That was my mom.

REPORT: NJ GOV Chris Christie’s BIG ‘Mistake’ That Cost Him WH Job,"Chris Christie knows how to create awkward political moments that s for sure! (*SEE PHOTO GAFFE GALLERY BELOW) Remember the game hug? The VERY awkward moment behind candidate Trump where he just stood there with a blank stare? His latest and most awkward political moment has to be  Beachgate  where he was captured lounging with his family on a NJ beach after closing it to the public. Ouch! We re just happy he wasn t hired by President Trump but was let go by Jared Kushner. Wheeew!In previous reports, we ve also discussed the election night gaffe of a bold Chris Christie shoving his way into photos with newly elected President Trump (see photo above). The word was that the president wasn t too happy about this and that this behavior cost Christie a position with the new Trump administration. The Christie  Bridgegate  scandal was another factor that s been reported.  The newest revelation exposes the ultimate mistake from Christie:Chris Christie made his  ultimate mistake  with Donald Trump when he bragged about talking to President Obama on election night and offered to let Trump   an infamous germaphobe   use Christie s cellphone to talk to Obama. If you win, he s going to call my phone, and I ll pass it over to you,  Christie said, according to excerpts of a new book obtained by the Daily Mail.A visibly angry Trump snapped at his top campaign aide: Hey Chris, you know my f king phone number. Just give it to the president. I don t want your f king phone,  Trump fumed.Christie, who never received a role in the White House despite his steadfast support for the president,  wouldn t recover  from the phone debacle, the report said.Christie made yet another critical mistake when he  pushed himself  into photos with Trump on election night.Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner   whose father was prosecuted by Christie, then a US attorney in New Jersey   gave the Garden State governor the ax right after Trump s victory.We have to say that after the latest Chris Christie gaffe of  Beachgate  where he closed the NJ beach to the public BUT opened it to only his family has us convinced that Trump and Kushner did the right thing!

"WHOA! RAND PAUL, NEWT GINGRICH RIP OBAMA’S National Security Advisor, Benghazi Video Liar, Susan Rice For ABRUPTLY Backing Out Of House Testimony [VIDEO]","Susan Rice will not visit Capitol Hill today for a meeting with the House committee probing allegations she  unmasked  President Trump associates in Russian meddling probes.Hmmm If Democrats really wanted to get to the bottom of their  Trump-Russia collusion  witch-hunt, it would certainly make sense that Rice would be jumping at the opportunity to testify at the House hearings.Rice had been expected to face tough questions on her role in the matter while serving as then-President Barack Obama s national security adviser. Trump alleges Rice may have committed a crime by asking government analysts to disclose the names of his associates documented in intelligence reports.Fox News was initially told Rice would be giving closed-door testimony Tuesday before the Republican-led House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.But that session has apparently been postponed.The panel is leading one of several investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 White House race, which have engulfed the Trump administration and evolved to include questions about whether anybody on Trump s campaign team colluded with the Kremlin to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan last week told Fox News that he wants Rice to answer the basic question:  Did you unmask the names and if so why? He also argued that Americans indeed deserve to know the truth about the Trump associates but they also want answers from high-ranking Obama administration officials who may have misled Americans on critical matters   including Rice, as U.S. ambassador to the U.N., saying the fatal 2012 Benghazi terror attacks were largely  sparked  by an anti-Muslim video. The American people want to get the truth on all of these issues,  said Jordan. He also raised concerns about how Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch handled the Clinton email investigation and whether James Comey exposed classified information in an apparent effort to retaliate against Trump firing him as FBI director.Rice has denied that she did anything inappropriate, saying she was authorized as Obama s national security adviser to seek the identities of people whose names were redacted from intelligence reports.And she has suggested that her race and gender may be playing a role in the controversy, in a recent New York Magazine interview.   Fox NewsIt would be more shocking to the American people if Rice didn t use her race and gender as an excuse for committing heinous crimes against American citizens. It s the only card left in the deck for a cheating, lying and deceitful administration with their backs firmly against the wall Fox News legal anchor Gregg Jarrett said Rice is lying. Jarrett goes on to explain exactly how Rice potentially committed 3 felonies:So THIS is why Susan Rice refuses to testify: she knows she committed three different felonies for Obama! #LockHerUp pic.twitter.com/fg37CijZPu  Newt-Trump Fan Club (@NewtTrump) July 18, 2017Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) told Obama sycophant and Trump-hater Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC s  The Morning Joe  that he believes Susan Rice  abused the system and she did it for political purposes.

Of course, Mika defended Rice, and then quickly qualified her obviously biased defense of Obama s former NSA director by saying she wasn t defending her.RAND PAUL: Drag Susan Rice in   make her testify under oath!

BITTER BRZEZINSKI and AP Reporter Go Low in Snarkfest on President Trump: ‘So He Doesn’t Look Like an Idiot’ [Video],"MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski had a  snarkfest  with AP reporter Julie Pace during a series of questions that culminated in her saying that President Donald Trump s actions on Obamacare made him  look like an idiot.  These two just brought journalism to a new low with this exchange:Pace was speaking about the reasons why Republicans were unable to pass a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Pace said that the White House had people connected on Capitol Hill who knew that the bill was in trouble. Trump expressed confidence in the bill s passage as late as Monday afternoon.Brzezinski asked:  Who s talking to the president before he gets out in front of the cameras at the White House with the vice president behind him saying  This is going to be good  an hour before this goes down in flames? Does the right hand know what the left is doing, at all? Is anybody speaking truth to this president? It s not even truth to power. Are they telling him what s going on so he doesn t look like an idiot? WHAT S PRESIDENT TRUMP SUPPOSED TO DO WITH SNAKES LIKE McCONNELL AND OTHERS? NOT TO MENTION THE DEMOCRATS WHO REFUSE TO WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT! This is where the AP reporter gets snarky on the president s moves.

LEFT-WING AUTHOR Blasts Democrats for “Scandal-Mongering”: “Rachel Maddow’s dots may never connect.” [Video],"While many on the left continue to accuse President Trump and his administration of colluding with the Russians, one well-known progressive thinker said such actions hurt their cause. Author Max Blumenthal said he s skeptical of the Russia narrative, remarking that  Rachel Maddow s dots may never connect. Blumenthal called Trump the  apotheosis of a failed political establishment,  saying the Russia story is simply a cover for establishment Republicans and progressive Democrats to be able to avoid  do[ing] anything progressive. He accused both parties of  scandal-mongering  and criticized the left for abandoning their anti-war ideology just to attack the president. He and Tucker Carlson discussed how some Democrats have advocated supporting insurgent elements in Syria for the sake of irritating Vladimir Putin. Blumenthal, the son of former Clinton adviser Sid Blumenthal, warned such behavior on-the-whole will have  long-term consequences for the left in this country. Max Blumenthal is a known progressive who s calling out his own party for the constant Russia-Trump bashing. He confronts Rep. Jamie Raskin on the Russia scandal:Max Blumenthal Grilled a Maryland Democrat on Lies About Russia Scam In Epic Interview:  I think we should tell the people the truth  [Video]This is hysterical! Blumenthal is awesome even though he s a leftist A rarity! Note at the end of the video that he calls out Raskin for saying  Trump is a Russian hoax Earlier in July he proposed a panel to oust President Trump: Pointing to the outcry over President Donald Trump s latest controversial tweets, freshman Rep. Jamie Raskin is urging his colleagues to get behind a bill that could potentially oust the President if he was mentally or physically unfit.The Maryland Democrat wants to create an 11-member commission made up of mostly physicians and psychiatrists   more formally called the  Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity.  The panel would carry out a medical examination and determine whether the President was physically or mentally able to do the job. Two of the commission s members would also be former high ranking officials, such as presidents, vice presidents, attorneys general or secretaries of state. It s a provocative and long-shot effort, but Raskin is citing as his legal backup the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, which was adopted in 1967 after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to establish procedure in the case a president is incapacitated. About two dozen Democrats have signed on to the effort as of Thursday. Raskin is zeroing in on one section of that constitutional amendment, which allows the vice president to assume powers if either the majority of the Cabinet or  such other body as Congress  finds that the President is  unable to discharge the powers and duties of office.  (The vice president would also have to agree to the assessment of the President s abilities.) Raskin is proposing his commission to serve as that  body. Raskin is a freshman in Congress Let s hope the people of Maryland kick him out after one term. It s obvious he s a liar and doesn t respect the office of POTUS.

SYRIAN MUSLIM IMMIGRANT HAIRDRESSER SLITS Female Employer’s Throat After Media Hailed Him As “Example Of Successful Integration”,"She wanted him to assimilate. She gave him a good job. She trusted him and offered the chance to prove he was willing to be a good employee. He slit her throat. There was nothing special or unique about Mohammad Hussain Rashwani, he was just another Muslim immigrant looking for a better life who had no interest in assimilating. Slitting his employer s throat is how Rashwani chose to show his gratitude for her trust in him.Mohammad Hussain Rashwani was hailed in the media as the  paramount example of successful integration  after he got a job as a hairdresser at a salon in Herzberg, Germany in late 2015.After a little over a year on the job, he decided to slit his female employer s throat.From Lausitzer Rundschau as translated by Gates of Vienna:  For me there weren t any signs that I could see Herzberg s hairdresser speaks about the knife attack by her Syrian employeeHerzberg s master hairdresser talks about what is motivating her these days since the attack by her Syrian employee two weeks ago.Should she have seen this attack against her coming? She keeps asking herself this question over and over. And she can t find an answer.  Even today, I do not know what I should think. Until that Wednesday evening, he was an endearing man. I believed up to the very last minute that something good could come of him because I appreciated his professional abilities very much,  Ilona F. says.The Herzberg woman doesn t want to talk about the attack itself; her thoughts are much more circling around  why  again and again.  Did I intervene too much? Was I too strong for him? Did we, my husband and I, organize too much for him?  These and other thoughts are constantly crossing her mind. But there weren t any signs that the Damascus-born Syrian maybe had other plans. His mother, which whom Ilona F. was in contact, had repeatedly written how grateful her son was for the chance that he received and how much he had respected the  she-boss .  He even assured my husband and me personally of this. Yet still, something had to have happened to him that made him commit this terrible bloody deed.  For me, there were no signs that something like this could happen,  the 64-year-old says, looking back. But, she admits, he had changed considerably in the past few months. Ilona F. explains:  We had invested a lot of time in him after our spectacular beginnings, and we had helped him in every way possible. We had plans. He is an outstanding hairdresser. The customers were super-happy with his work. Until the very last minute I had believed that things were going to work. Here s where the story that is all too typical of Muslim immigrants starts to take shape:Even then changes started to set in. He, a Muslim who until now did not seem in any way a devout believer, had began to talk about Allah more and more. This certainly got on her nerves for over time. He also quit visiting the hairdresser and her husband at home. Before the changes he came by almost every day. They had talked about everything, professional and private. But he had begun to neglect his study of the German language more and more.  He kept assuring me that he wanted to learn the language, but later. More and more he said later this, later that, when we talked about his future,  the businesswoman recounts.And then there were also problems in the salon. Mohammad H. came to work too late more often; he didn t take time very seriously. He became very reluctant to drive to work at Sch newalde, where his boss owned a second hair salon. And during the week the attack took place, he outright refused to go.After a disagreement in the Herzberg salon, when a customer was unhappy with the work of the Syrian hairdresser, she had given him notice that they had to talk.  I knew it couldn t go on like this. But immediately the question arose in my mind, what would become of him if I were to throw him out. After all, I still believed in him. That this by now was a fatal mistake is something the Herzberg woman is only slowly beginning to realize.  That I could have been so wrong in my judgment of another person,  she shakes her head.  Actually, I feel really sorry for him.

ANGRY LEFTIST Grills Democrat On Russia Scam In Epic Interview: “I think we should tell the people the truth” [Video],"Max Blumenthal is a known progressive who s out to get his own party for the constant Russia-Trump bashing. He confronts Rep. Jamie Raskin on the Russia scandal:This is hysterical! Blumenthal is awesome even though he s a leftist A rarity! Note at the end of the video that he calls out Raskin for saying  Trump is a Russian hoax Earlier in July he proposed a panel to oust President Trump: Pointing to the outcry over President Donald Trump s latest controversial tweets, freshman Rep. Jamie Raskin is urging his colleagues to get behind a bill that could potentially oust the President if he was mentally or physically unfit.The Maryland Democrat wants to create an 11-member commission made up of mostly physicians and psychiatrists   more formally called the  Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity.  The panel would carry out a medical examination and determine whether the President was physically or mentally able to do the job. Two of the commission s members would also be former high ranking officials, such as presidents, vice presidents, attorneys general or secretaries of state. It s a provocative and long-shot effort, but Raskin is citing as his legal backup the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, which was adopted in 1967 after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to establish procedure in the case a president is incapacitated. About two dozen Democrats have signed on to the effort as of Thursday. Raskin is zeroing in on one section of that constitutional amendment, which allows the vice president to assume powers if either the majority of the Cabinet or  such other body as Congress  finds that the President is  unable to discharge the powers and duties of office.  (The vice president would also have to agree to the assessment of the President s abilities.) Raskin is proposing his commission to serve as that  body. Raskin is a freshman in Congress Let s hope the people of Maryland kick him out after one term. It s obvious he s a liar and doesn t respect the office of POTUS.

"JESSE WATTERS LIKE YOU’VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE! Watch Him Rip Into Juan Williams Over Calling Trump Family “Unpatriotic”…Schools Him On Corrupt Democratic Party Ties To Communism, On Crooked Hillary and Barack Obama","Fox News   The Five  host, Jesse Watters let loose on liberal crybaby co-host Juan Williams during their most recent show. Waters lost it over liberals who would dare to call President Trump and his family  unpatriotic . Watters started his rant by saying, I m very sick of the Democrats calling the Trump family  unpatriotic!'  He went on to say that the left are  now the McCarthyites .He was only getting started however. Watters then gave Juan Williams a history lesson that just about blew the doors off the Fox News set.Watters to Williams:  Let s remember what party defeated the Soviet Union, while the Democratic Party was trying to appease and mimic Communism. Party. Democrats have been cozying up to dictators and our enemies for years. Giving the Iranians billions of dollars, giving North Koreans billions of dollars. Shaking Hugo Chavez s hand, shaking the Castro s hands.  The Clinton s were taking money from Chinese nationals in 1996 reelection campaign and then selling satellite technology to the Chinese that enabled their missile program to blow up. The media colluded with the Democrats, letting Hillary cheat during the debates. President Obama, palling around with domestic terrorists, sitting in the same church as an American-hating preacher. The Democrats undermining the military. Juan Williams attempted to break in and stop Watters, but Jesse was on a roll and he wasn t giving up.Watters continued,  Giving birth to ISIS. Lying about a terrorist attack. It was at that point, that Juan Williams was practically begging for mercy!  Stop, stop! How much more can we take. Watters finished his rant by telling Williams,  Donald Trump s family has done more for this country than any Democrat elected official. He s provided more jobs in the real estate industry, in the fast-food industry, in the fashion industry, in the hotel and casino industry. He s created more wealth than anybody in this entire  So to smear them as the  mafia  or  unpatriotic  is shameful.  And I think everyone needs to wake up and realize, that this family s a patriotic family and what s happening now is a coup against the will of the American people!

CHILDISH CNN HOST Refuses To Call Trump Her President: “He’s YOUR President” [Video],"Low blow! Political hack Angela Rye refused to say that President Trump is the president of the United States during a CNN interview this morning. This bitter woman is truly childish. This is the same former exec director of the CBC who said Trump gained success off the backs of  poor people  (SEE VIDEO BELOW).Arguing with former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA), Rye said,  There are a lot of things that your president has done to defy logic. Your president, too, Angela. Your president too,  Kingston responded with a smile. He s YOUR president,  Rye shot back. The president of the United States,  CNN host John Berman said as he concluded the segment, seemingly agreeing with Kingston.The tone from liberals on Trump s legitimacy differs greatly from the president s own attitude toward former President Obama. Speaking at CPAC in 2011, Trump told the anti-Obama crowd that  He is our president. THIS IS THE SAME WOMAN WHO SAID REPARATIONS AREN T UNAMERICAN: Angela Rye, former executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus, is one angry woman!

"50-YR OLD HAITI OFFICIAL, Slated To Testify Against Clinton Foundation Corruption Next Week, Found DEAD In Miami With “Gunshot to the head”","One man was set to testify against the Clinton Foundation next week. That man was 50 year old former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein. He was found dead in his Miami home with a  gunshot to the head  that s been ruled a  suicide  by the Miami-Dade s medical examiner records supervisor. (Think Vince Foster)Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.Eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government s economic development agency, Fonds d assistance  conomique et social, for three years.According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8%   or $5.4 billion   was funneled to non-Haitian organizations. The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,  Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.The former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza   the Klaus Special   named after him.According to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in  good spirits , with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide. It s really shocking,  said Muncheez s owner Gilbert Bailly.  We grew up together; he was like family.   Your News WireAmericans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clinton s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to  side  with the Clinton Administration and he would  be the richest man in Haiti. He also demanded that Hillary Clinton  disclose the audit of all money  related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation. Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti. Go to the 5 minute mark of the video to see Sansaricq s comments to candidate Trump:",politics,"Jul 17, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
BOOM! HARVARD LAW DEMOCRAT ALAN DERSHOWITZ Destroys The Left’s “Unconstitutional” Argument Against Donald Trump Jr. [Video],"Democrat Alan Dershowitz dismissed a major argument Democrats have been making against Donald Trump Jr., and said it s clearly  unconstitutional . This brilliant Harvard Law professor is a Democrat who is FED UP with the left s constant Russia mantra! He knows there s nothing there and tells Judge Jeanine:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjqxLE6thZIDemocrats have been arguing that laws stop campaigns from receiving anything of  value  from foreign entities, and have said  that items of  value  can also be information.That s their reasoning for why they think Trump s campaign violated election laws when Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer who said she had dirt on Hillary Clinton.Not so fast! Harvard Law s Alan Dershowitz told Judge Jeanine that campaign finance laws have never been prosecuted that way and that using the law to prosecute people who obtain information from non-U.S. sources would violate the First Amendment: Under the campaign finance laws, I mean, there is a claim that if you get something of value, and they re alleging that information  from a foreign national could be, you know, stretched out to mean, you know, words. Judge Jeanine asked  Is that something that s ever been prosecuted? Dershowitz replied:  Of course not, and if it were to be prosecuted, the First Amendment would trump. A candidate has a right to get information from whatever source the information comes. Dershowitz then made the key point that just as newspapers are free to print any information they obtain from others, even when the source obtains it illegally, candidates for office have the same right to get information anywhere they want.He also stressed again there is no legal precedent to treat information as money under U.S. campaign finance laws: You can t include information under the campaign finance law. That would be unconstitutional. These are very key points that the press refuses to make clear for people   Have you heard this anywhere? Note that this is coming from a DEMOCRAT who was a Hillary Clinton supporter! Please pass on to anyone who  has been listening to the hysteria from the lefty media and even FOX News!

LIBERALS ARE AFRAID Of Kid Rock Running For U.S. Senate…Elizabeth Warren’s Panicked Email Proves It,"Kid Rock has struck panic into the hearts of liberal politicians upon his announcement that he will be running for senate in Michigan.Kid Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, is from Romeo, Michigan and will be a force to be reckoned with in the upcoming election.U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is already sounding the alarm with her Democratic base, warning a Senate run by Detroit bad boy Kid Rock could be the second coming of Donald Trump.Watch Fox News host, Tom Shillue tell panelists,  If Kid Rock runs for Senate, he ll win :The  Wasting Time  and  All Summer Long  rap rocker-turned-country singer tweeted on Wednesday that he s running for U.S. Senate in Michigan. Although it s been largely dismissed so far as a publicity stunt, Warren isn t taking any chances with the longshot Republican. I know a lot of people are thinking: this is some sort of joke, right?  Warren wrote in an email blast with the subject line  Senator Kid Rock (R-MI). Well,  she said,  maybe this is all a joke   but we all thought Donald Trump was joking when he rode down the escalator at Trump Tower and announced his campaign, too. And sure, maybe this is just a marketing gimmick for a new album or tour   but we all thought Donald Trump was just promoting his reality TV show, too,  she added.In her email, Warren included a link where people could donate to Michigan Democratic U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow and her own reelection campaign.A Warren campaign spokeswoman did not return repeated inquiries about how much the fundraising appeal has hauled in or the strategy behind it.But if the effort succeeds, other Democrats are likely to also cash in on a Rock candidacy   remote as it may be   to fill their own campaign coffers, said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. Political elites and activists who actually give money to campaigns keep up with all this stuff,  he said. Plus, the most effective direct mail is often tied to something that just happened   something that can be spun into a threat. Republican state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who will officially challenge Warren next month, blasted the email as proof that Warren is more concerned about crafting a bid for the White House. She uses any and every issue, whether it s a celebrity Republican or it s Hillary Clinton, to try to scare her support base into giving her more money so that she can reach that main goal I believe of running for president   not of focusing on the concerns of her constituents in Massachusetts,  said Diehl.Still, don t count him out, said Saul Anuzis, the former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. He s well-liked,  said Anuzis.  He s a big proponent of Detroit and somebody who s put his money where his mouth is investing back home.

OOPS! MIT Researchers Debunk Global Warming Data…Report Confirms President Trump Was Right To Pull Out Of Paris Climate Agreement,"B b..but Al Gore and Barack Obama say Scientists  were exposed for manipulating climate data during the 2011 Climategate  scandal when 5,000 emails were released from scientists proving that the science behind their studies is inconclusive and mostly a result of manipulating climate data to fit the political message they were trying to convey.Three themes emerged from the emails that were released in the Climategate scandal: (1) prominent scientists central to the global warming debate are taking measures to conceal rather than disseminate underlying data and discussions; (2) these scientists view global warming as a political  cause  rather than a balanced scientific inquiry and (3) many of these scientists frankly admit to each other that much of the science is weak and dependent on deliberate manipulation of facts and data.  ForbesA new report on global warming data has now proven President Donald Trump to be right to pull out of the Paris Agreement. The report analyzed climate data such as Global Average Surface Temperature (GAST), the NOAA, and HADLEY.SHFTPLan reports: According to the report, which has been peer reviewed by administrators, scientists and researchers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.), and several of America s leading universities, the data is completely bunk: In this research report, the most important surface data adjustment issues are identified and past changes in the previously reported historical data are quantified. It was found that each new version of GAST has nearly always exhibited a steeper warming linear trend over its entire history. And, it was nearly always accomplished by systematically removing the previously existing cyclical temperature pattern. This was true for all three entities providing GAST data measurement, NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU.As a result, this research sought to validate the current estimates of GAST using the best available relevant data. This included the best documented and understood data sets from the U.S. and elsewhere as well as global data from satellites that provide far more extensive global coverage and are not contaminated by bad siting and urbanization impacts. Satellite data integrity also benefits from having cross checks with Balloon data.The conclusive findings of this research are that the three GAST data sets are not a valid representation of reality. In fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data. Thus, it is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that recent years have been the warmest ever  despite current claims of record setting warming.Finally, since GAST data set validity is a necessary condition for EPA s GHG/CO2 Endangerment Finding, it too is invalidated by these research findings. (Full Abstract Report) Fox News reported on President Trump pulling out of the Paris Agreement per his campaign promise: he is leading. President Trump is withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Accord.It is the right decision for a number of reasons.First, the Paris Accord is being treated by many as a treaty with treaty obligations, but President Obama never submitted it to Congress for passage.Second, though President Trump could have left it in place and done nothing, his successor could have easily revived it if left in place.Third, the structure and implementation of the Paris Accord set a terrible precedent. President Obama worked for what amounts to a global agreement with voluntary measures, but those measures would impact the American economy. But, despite that impact, President Obama did not present the Paris Accord to Congress for ratification or debate. Members of the liberal establishment were outraged.Obama criticized President Trump s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate agreement with the following statement : A year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world we leave to our children.It was steady, principled American leadership on the world stage that made that achievement possible.  It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher as well. And what made that leadership and ambition possible was America s private innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar   industries that created some of the fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in recent years, and contributed to the longest streak of job creation in our history.Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future.  And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale.The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.  I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.  But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we ve got. But of course, like all Champagne Socialists, their credo is  do as I say, not as I do,  with Obama jacking up his carbon footprint when abroad. Who could forget Obama s massive convoy during a recent speaking gig in Milan?The Independent Journal Review reported: Former President Barack Obama traveled to Italy this week to make a speech on climate change at the  Seed & Chips: The Global Food Innovation Summit  in the city of Milan.It seems like Obama has taken a page out of Leonardo DiCaprio s book of  do as I say, not as I do  and took a private jet to Milan. Not only that, he had a 14 car convoy to get into the city, which also included protection from above with a helicopter.It doesn t end there. According to The Daily Mail, 300 police officers were used to protect the former president.The fleet of 14 included multiple SUVs, police cars, and sedans   not to mention a few motorcycles. Here s another look at the convoy:While in Milan, Obama also met with former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who was a close partner during their respective times in office.

CONSERVATIVE FIREBRAND ANN COULTER DESTROYS Delta Airlines On Twitter For Kicking Her Out Of Reserved Seat,"There are some people you probably shouldn t cross. Donald Trump is one, and conservative author and political analyst Ann Coulter is the other one Conservative columnist Ann Coulter flew into a fit of fury Saturday after Delta Airlines booted her from her reserved  Comfort+  seat   which comes with 3 additional inches of legroom   and gave it to another passenger.In a two-hour tweeting tantrum,she quoted her exchange with a flight attendant:  Why are you taking me out of the extra room seat I specifically booked?  she asked.Their answer, she said, was  I don t know. Before Coulter posted a picture of the woman Delta gave her extra-legroom reserved seat to, she tweeted this:Suckiest @Delta moved me from my PRE-BOOKED SEAT & gave it to some woman, not elderly, child, or sick.

REEBOK JOINS The Left’s War Against President Trump…Berates Him On Twitter For Complimenting French President Macron’s Wife,"Brigitte Macron is 24 years older than her husband. She is 64-years old and is in great shape for a woman of her age. As a female, who is younger than Mrs. Macron, I would be thrilled if the most powerful man in the world shook my hand and offered me a sincere compliment about what  great shape  I was in. Mrs. Macron didn t likely wake up one morning and decide she wanted to be a stunning 64-year old woman. She likely had to work at it. Being a 64-year old woman who is married to a charismatic 39-year old man, who is also the newly elected leader of France is probably not that easy. She likely has a rigorous workout schedule, and if she is like most women, she appreciates it when someone notices how hard she works to stay in  great shape.  It is possible that Macron has simply been gifted with great genes and does nothing at all to stay in  great shape , but either way, a compliment about her appearance was likely appreciated by the 64-year old stunner. The Daily Mail ran a wildly popular article in May about Brigitte Macron titled:How DOES Macron s wife defy her age? Experts claim hair extensions, veneers, designer style and some very subtle cosmetic surgery keep Brigitte Trogneux, 64, looking so youthfulHmmm We don t remember the outrage from the media over the Daily Mail article that explored every possibility that could explain Macron s age-defying look, that ran just prior to France s election. There will, of course, always be critics. After all, the compliment didn t just come from any man, it came from the man who was not supposed to defeat the media s candidate, Hillary Clinton.Many on social media have criticized the Macron couple s difference in age. Macron s campaign was very aware that the age difference could be a turn off to some voters, as the media was quick to dispel any thoughts that Brigitte was some sort of  pedophile  or  cougar.  They shared the Macron s unusual story of how Emmanuel Macron fell in love with his wife Brigitte while she was his high school drama teacher. They talked about how he pledged his love to her early on, promising he would come back some day and marry her. (How quickly everyone forgets the criticism Donald Trump got on social media for marrying the much younger Melania.)In case the world hasn t noticed, President Trump doesn t play the same game as other politicians. He s genuine and honest. He says what he feels and most importantly, he says what s in his heart. He s not a career politician, and for that, most of us are grateful. When President Trump greeted Brigitte Macron for the first time, he shook her hand, looked her straight in the eye, and complimented her on how great she looked. Trump simply told her,  You re in such great shape  and then followed it up by telling her she was  beautiful . The media and those on the left went nuts. It wasn t just individuals on social media and leftist journalists who attacked Donald Trump. One major athletic apparel and accessory company took to Twitter to mock our sitting President.For some reason, someone at Reebok thought it would be a good idea to tweet a chart to President Trump to let him know whether or not he should compliment the 64-year old Macron. When did Reebok become the arbiter of free-speech? Who, at Reebok decided it would be a good idea to mock our President on social media?  Is Reebok really such a powerful athletic wear company that they can afford to lose half of their customer base over a stupid tweet?  In case you were wondering when it IS appropriate to say, ""You're in such good shape beautiful,""  THIS: pic.twitter.com/Z1cnnRD8Ut  Reebok (@Reebok) July 14, 2017Note to Reebok: We don t care that President Trump offended French liberals and leftist American journalists. We don t care that he offended Democrat lawmakers, who are constantly looking for a reason to discredit our president. We care that President Trump loves America, and that he wakes up every day thinking about how he ll continue to bring more jobs back to Americans. We admire him for his commitment to putting America first and for his dedication to keeping our nation safe. We don t give a damn if you re offended over President Trump s  compliments to Brigitte Macron.The Macron s spent several hours with the Trump s, after President Trump offered his sincere compliments to Brigitte. Many of the photos taken after the first meeting with the Macron s and Trump s defy what the media would like you to believe about Trump s relationship with the French president and his wife. In fact, quite to the contrary, Mr. and Mrs. Macron appeared to be enjoying their visit with America s first couple quite a bit.

WHOA! MAXINE WATERS Has Brain Freeze Mid-Interview: “What-What…” [Video],"Maxine Waters has a major brain freeze during an interview ripping on the Trump administration Karma?  Recognize that evidence is pouring in and it s growing or what is matt  what what is wrong with them, I just don t quite understand,  If Maxine Waters is the best the Dems have in their arsenal then this is good news for Republicans. The California Democrat has been bashing President Trump at every turn with no real reason. She s even called for his impeachment. Is this all she s got? She never speaks about what she s doing for the district in California that she doesn t even live in. She refuses to hear any opposing views during town halls. She has opposing voices removed so the adoring masses can rant and rave about Trump. It s truly a Banana Republic in Maxine s world. We ve reported in the past about her bizarre behavior but the best question was asked by Tucker Carlson:Maxine Waters is so filled with hate for anyone who disagrees with her, that she s decided to appoint herself as the Democrat s chief attack dog for President Trump and his administration. Unfortunately for Maxine, making a public spectacle of herself also comes with a price. Speaking of a price how about the price tag on career politician Maxine Waters $4.3 million mansion?Tucker Carlson reacted to Rep. Maxine Waters  (D-Calif.) threat to  take [HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson s] a** apart  by noting she might indeed be qualified to take his job.Carlson said Waters, a 40-year politician, lives in a 6,000 square-foot mansion worth $4.3 million that is not in her congressional district.He asked how Waters could afford a home like that in a ritzy neighborhood while solely working as a representative of the 43rd District. We should take her seriously on this subject,  Carlson said, calling her a  confirmed expert on the question on housing. He said that while Waters sometimes speaks using racially-charged rhetoric, she lives in a neighborhood that is only six percent African-American.Via: Fox News",politics,"Jul 16, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
IS TRUMP DITCHING Obama’s “Bad Deal” to Bring Muslim Refugees in Australia to the US?,"President Trump called Obama s agreement with Australia to bring in economic parasites disguised as refugees to the US a  bad deal  and a  dumb deal . President Obama made this deal right before leaving office dumping it into the lap of the incoming administration. Trump was unhappy about this  dumb deal  but reluctantly decided to send US officials to vet the refugees:US Officials just abruptly halted screening and left the offshore detention centre on Friday. Is this a sign that this  bad deal  is upside down and will not go forward? We certainly hope so!AUSTRALIA, Christmas Island: Here are some of the so-called  asylum seekers  from the hordes of Muslims who have been washing up on the shores of Australia and demanding asylum, even though most are not political refugees, but economic parasites. Do these Iranian illegals look like they are starving to you? THIS WAS A SETUP BY OBAMA   THE US HAS NO BUSINESS TAKING ECONOMIC PARASITES FROM IRAN!THE LATEST ON THESE ECONOMIC PARASITES:Reuters Reports:US officials interviewing refugees held in an Australian-run offshore detention centre have left the facility abruptly, throwing further doubt over a plan to resettle many of the detainees in America.US officials halted screening interviews and departed the Pacific island of Nauru on Friday, two weeks short of their scheduled timetable and a day after Washington said the United States had reached its annual refugee intake cap. US officials were scheduled to be on Nauru until July 26 but they left on Friday,  one refugee told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he did not want to jeopardise his application for US resettlement.In the United States, a senior member of the union that represents refugee officers at US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a Department of Homeland Security agency, told Reuters his own trip to Nauru was not going forward as scheduled.Jason Marks, chief steward of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1924, told Reuters his trip has now been pushed back and it was unclear whether it will actually happen.The Australian Immigration Department declined to comment on the whereabouts of the US officials or the future of a refugee swap agreement between Australia and the United States, which President Donald Trump earlier this year branded a  dumb deal .An indefinite postponement of the deal would have significant repercussions for Australia s pledge to close a second detention centre on Papua New Guinea s Manus island on October 31.Only 70 refugees, less than 10 per cent of the total detainees held in the camp, have completed US processing. The US deal looks more and more doubtful,  Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said.Former US President Obama agreed a deal with Australia late last year to offer refuge to up to 1250 asylum seekers.The Trump administration said it would only honour the deal to maintain a strong relationship with Australia, and then only on condition that refugees satisfied strict checks.In exchange, Australia has pledged to take Central American refugees from a centre in Costa Rica, where the United States has taken in a larger number of people in recent years.The US government confirmed on Thursday that its refugee intake cap of 50,000 people had been reached with the new intake year not due to begin until October 1.The majority of the detainees interviewed on both Manus and Nauru by US officials in April are from Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan.Australia has already offered detainees up to $25,000 to voluntarily return to their home countries, an offer few have taken up.

MN: SOMALI MAN RAPES COLLEGE STUDENT…Gets 90-Days In Jail…Allowed to Leave Scene Of Crime Without Arrest by Somali Officer,"A 24-year-old Somali man, Ashraf Alaaeldin Mohamed Elgamal, raped an unconscious Minnesota State University student and was given only 90 days in prison and two years of probation.A student at MSU walked back to her apartment, intoxicated, after a party and went to bed. She woke up to find Elgamal raping her. She was drifting in and out of consciousness and when she asked him to stop, he responded:  bitch, stop being selfish .The friends of the victim called the police when they walked into her room and saw Elgamal on top of their unconscious friend. The Mankato Public Safety officer who responded was named Mohamed Mohamed and was also Somali. When the officer spoke to Elgamal, he informed him that he was  not under arrest and free to leave at any time , even though he was made aware that Elgamal was seen penetrating the unconscious girl and asked to stop. Elgamal claimed the sex was consensual and said he thought the victim accused him of rape because he has a girlfriend.

WOW! HUNGARY and ISRAEL Just Labeled Hungarian Born-Jew George Soros An ENEMY OF THE STATE…Will The U.S. Follow?,"Hillary would never have labeled one of her largest donors, longtime friend, and the financier of violent anti-American protesters around the world an  enemy of the state.  But fortunately for America, Hillary s not our president. Fortunately for America, both the Senate and the House are controlled by Republicans who understand we have a lot to lose if they continue to sit back and let this radical billionaire throw hundreds of millions of dollars at these violent, anti-American groups. Soros  goals are not consistent with those of our Founding Fathers. His agenda is counter to protecting our freedoms and defending our national security. It s time our legislators consider taking the same steps as Israel and Hungary to send George Soros a message that we consider him an enemy of the state, and that we re not going to just sit by and watch him force his radical agenda on America.  Israel s foreign ministry has issued a statement denouncing U.S. billionaire George Soros, a move that appeared designed to align Israel more closely with Hungary ahead of a visit to Budapest next week by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew who has spent a large part of his fortune funding pro-democracy and human rights groups, has repeatedly been targeted by Hungary s right-wing government, in particular over his support for more open immigration.In the latest case, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has backed a campaign in which Soros is singled out as an enemy of the state.  Let s not allow Soros to have the last laugh  say billboards next to a picture of the 86-year-old investor, a campaign that Jewish groups and others say foments anti-Semitism.Soros, who rarely addresses personal attacks against him, has not commented on the billboards. But Hungarian Jewish groups and Human Rights Watch, an organization partly funded by Soros, have condemned the campaign, saying it  evokes memories of the Nazi posters during the Second World War .  ReutersThere s one big problem with the statement by Soros  Human Rights Watch group, Soros admitted he was no friend to the Jews during the Holocaust in a 1990 interview with Steve Kroft of  60 Minutes . The interview was suspiciously scrubbed from the internet for some time, but has just recently resurfaced. Knowing there were problems ahead for the Jews, Soros  father, who was a successful lawyer, bribed a government official to take 14 year old George Soros in and say he was his Christian godson. While hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being shipped off to the death camps, George Soros accompanied his appointed  godfather  around confiscating property from Jews. George admitted it wasn t difficult at all to take part in taking property from the Jews. Kroft asked Soros if it bothered him?Soros: It created no problem at all.Kroft: No feeling of guilt?Soros: No.Why should Israel tread lightly when it comes to this monster who had no feelings of guilt about taking property from fellow Jews during the Holocaust?Watch:Soros was born in Hungary, they are interestingly, the second nation to consider George Soros to be an enemy of the state. Fox News   When Soros talks of chaos, it s a subject he knows well. The only question is his involvement.Most everywhere Soros, his foundations or his investment money has gone, trouble has followed.He s helped start revolutions, undermined national currencies and funded radicals around the world.Soros has been convicted of insider dealing in France and fined $3 million, fined another $2 million in his native Hungary.His  foundations have been accused of shielding spies and breaking currency laws  and his investing strategy has been targeted for harming several national currencies.That s not the story the broadcast networks have been telling about Soros for the past five years.There were 29 mentions of Soros during that time but only one gave any hint at trouble, and that was merely to mention he was  still known as the man who broke the Bank of England. But ABC followed that description up with:  That was all legal. Only a sex scandal with a 28-year-old Brazilian actress gave Soros any negative publicity at all.But there have been lots of negatives in Soros s past as he s spread his influence around the world. Soros wears criticism like a badge of honor. I have now come under attack in several countries: in Hungary from Hungarian nationalists; in Romania from the Vatra Romanesca; in Slovakia from the communist party newspaper Pravda; in the Soviet Union by the organ of the hard-liners Sovietskaia Russiya,  he claims in  Underwriting Democracy. Soros s Open Society Fund was created in 1979 as a charitable lead trust. Even its creator admitted his motives were  basically selfish  and he wanted a  tax gimmick.  He did it as a  trust for his children While Soros has been known worldwide for his investment skills, he hasn t always managed to stay clear of the authorities.He was found guilty in France of an insider trading case about 20 years ago and has repeatedly failed at having that news pulled from his record.According to The New York Times, in September 2011, a French panel upheld his conviction because  he had bought and sold shares of Soci t  G n rale in 1988 with the knowledge that the bank might be a takeover target. He was fined $3 million.His fund ran into problems in Hungary, where Soros was born and lived till his late teen years. At issue was how he handled an investment into the  the country s largest bank : OTP. His fund was fined $2 million by Hungarian regulators last week for having manipulated OTP s stock price,  wrote The New York Times in 2009.",politics,"Jul 15, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"IMMIGRANT With Soros-Funded Education, Who Earned $1.5 Million Per Year as DC Lawyer, Flees To “Somewhere in Africa” After Wife Is Caught Collecting Over $100,00 In Welfare [VIDEO]","An Arlington woman was arrested this week and charged with four counts of welfare fraud for collecting over $100,000 in benefits   all while her husband was a high-earning attorney in D.C., police say.Police say a six-month investigation into Helen Agbapuruonwu, 41, found that the mother of four had collected benefits like food stamps and Medicaid assistance for the past six years. While Helen was collecting benefits, her husband, Fidelis Agbapuruonwu, was earning $1.5 million per year as a lawyer, according to court documents obtained by News4.In 2001, Fidelis received the prestigious Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship which helped pay his way through law school.The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans offers up to $90,000 for two years of graduate education. Paul Soros, older brother to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, created the fellowship program in 1998 to honor  the contributions of immigrants and children of immigrants to the United States,  and help fund graduate study for immigrants  who are poised to make significant contributions to US society, culture or their academic field. As a lawyer at Mayer Brown, Agbapuruonwu worked on a number financial and civil cases, according to a search of federal court records.In one of his cases, Agbapuruonwu assisted a pro bono team in 2011, which helped a woman from El Salvador win asylum in the U.S. from the  continuous and severe physical, emotional, and psychological abuse inflicted by her ex-boyfriend.

LIST OF 24 REPUBLICANS Who Voted “YES” To KEEP Obama’s Taxpayer-Funded Sex-Change Surgeries In Place For Transgenders In Military,"If you re not okay with taxpayers paying for exorbitant medical costs, including transgender surgeries for military members, you ll want to remember these names in 2018 A majority in the House voted down a proposal to restrict funding for transgender members of the military, standing by social policy changes enacted by the Pentagon under former President Barack Obama.Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., succeeded in forcing a vote, arguing that Obama s  transgender decision is costly in dollars and short on common sense.  The attempted rollback failed on a 209-214 vote, however, as 24 Republicans joined a unanimous Democratic caucus in opposing the proposal. The Obama transgender policy, which was implemented without input from members of Congress, is ill-conceived and contrary to our goals of increasing troop readiness and investing defense dollars into addressing budget shortfalls of the past,  Hartzler said in June.  By recruiting and allowing transgender individuals to serve in our military we are subjecting taxpayers to high medical costs including up to $130,000 per transition surgery, lifetime hormone treatments, and additional surgeries to address the high percentage of individuals who experience complications. Her amendment would have barred the Defense Department from  provid[ing] medical treatment (other than mental health treatment) related to gender transition  to members of the military. Proponents of transgender military service argued that her proposal  would reduce military readiness  by discouraging transgender Americans from serving. It would have a negative impact on morale, a negative impact on retention and move us away from the merit-based system which we now have, where we have one set of rules applied to everybody,  Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo., who co-chairs the LGBT Equality Caucus, said Wednesday.Hartzler maintained that her amendment would increase readiness, however.  The deployability of individuals going through the sex transition process is highly problematic, requiring 210 to 238 work days where a soldier is non-deployable after surgery,  she said.  This recovery time equates to 1.4 million manpower days where transgender personnel cannot deploy and fight our nation s wars, therefore relying on an already stressed force to pick up the burden. It makes no sense to purposely recruit individuals who cannot serve.   Washington ExaminerHere s the list of 24 Republicans who voted to keep Obama s transgender policy for our military in place that was implemented without input from members of Congress:Justin Amash (Michigan)Jack Bergman (Michigan)Mike Coffman (Colorado)Barbara Comstock (Virginia)Paul Cook (California)Ryan Costello (Pennsylvania)Carlos Curbelo (Florida)Jeff Denham (California)Charlie Dent (Pennsylvania)John Faso (New York)Brian Fitzpatrick (Pennsylvania)Darrell Issa (California)John Katko (New York)Steve Knight (California)Leonard Lance (New Jersey)Frank LoBiondo (New Jersey)Tom MacArthur (New Jersey)Brian Mast (Florida)Tom Reed (New York)Dave Reichert (Washington)Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Florida)Bill Shuster (Pennsylvania)Elise Stefanik (New York)Claudia Tenney (New York)h/t Truth Division",politics,"Jul 14, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

BREAKING NEWS: OBAMA’S AG Loretta Lynch Ordered Manafort’s Phone Tapped During Meeting With Russian Lawyer,"Is anyone really shocked that another fake  Trump-Russian collusion  story points to Obama and his crooked administration?Today, Fusion GPS employee Rinat Akhmetshin today confirmed his attendance at a meeting with Donald Trump Jr, Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner along with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.Accusations have arisen that the meeting was part of a wider setup to achieve a FISA warrant to wiretap phones of the Trump campaign during 2016. President Trump himself has accused the FBI under Loretta Lynch of wiretapping his campaign. Now, a former Trump campaign official reports that Paul Manafort s phone was subject to FISA wiretap during the infamous meeting.If true, this FISA warrant would have been carried out under Loretta Lynch, Attorney General to Barack Obama. Former FBI Director James Comey has testified under oath to instances of collusion between AG Lynch and the Clinton campaign during 2016, as well as obstruction of justice in the Clinton investigation. Yesterday, multiple news agencies and President Trump all stated that Veselnitskaya was granted special permission to enter the US by Attorney General Lynch after her visa had been initially blocked.FISA transcripts of the meeting in June 2016 may have also served the basis of the FBI s investigation into the Trump campaign s ties to Russia, now headed by Bob Mueller.Other senior members of the Trump campaign may have participated in the meeting via conference call. Update: This would have been illegal, as FISA court denied Obama s June 2016 request.For entire story: Jack Posobiac, The Medium",politics,"Jul 14, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

JPMORGAN CEO Blows Up at the DC Dysfunction: Tired of Listening to the ‘Stupid Sh*t’ [Video],"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon went on a rant about the dysfunction in DC during the company s earnings conference call Friday: The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet Dimon had been considered for a position in President Trump s cabinet. He s been an adviser to Trump too. While there are some things Dimon clearly disagrees with the president on, they are able to work together: He is the President of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our airplane,  Dimon said,  I would try to help any President of the United States because I m a patriot. During the bank s annual meeting in May, 2016, Dimon reportedly commented on what he thinks the government should work on:Dimon emphasized the areas he believes are in serious need of fixing, including education, infrastructure, and tax reform. Our corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas and excessive regulation is reducing growth and business formation particularly for small businesses. THE STUPID SH*T WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN THIS COUNTRY It s almost embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country,  Dimon said in response to an analyst question. Since the Great Recession, which is now 8 years old, we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2 percent in spite of stupidity and political gridlock, because the American business sector is powerful and strong,  he said.  What I m saying is that it would be much stronger growth if there were more intelligent decisions and less gridlock. The executive of the U.S. banking giant cited travels to countries such as France, Argentina, Israel and Ireland. The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet  and  it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies,  he said.JPMorgan Chase reported earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates Friday. However, the bank lowered its forecast for lending revenue.DC has been in gridlock over the health care bill, which is holding up the passage of new legislation on tax reform. The Senate cut short its August recess by two weeks in order to deal with health care. There are about a dozen Senators opposed to the current bill citing the possibility that this new health care bill is  Obamacare lite . Senator Rand Paul has voiced strong opposition to this new bill.Here s the transcript from Dimon:Since the Great Recession which is now eight years old we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2% despite the stupidity and political gridlock. Because the American business sector is powerful and strong and is going to grow regardless of they went to feed their kids and want to buy home they want to do things the same as American businesses what I m saying is it would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and that gridlock, and thank you for pointing it out because I m going to be a broken record until this gets done, we are unable to build bridges, unable to build airports, not graduating.I was just in France, in Argentina, Israel, Ireland we met with the Prime Minister of India and China it s amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies to promote business growth is good for the average citizens of those countries for jobs and wages and somehow this great American free enterprise system we no longer get it.My view is corporate taxation is critical to that by the way regarding capital brings overseas, which is why the $2 trillion overseas benefiting all these other countries don t like that, so if we don t get our act together we can still grow. It s just unfortunate but it s hurting us, it s hurting the body politic, it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies. So no in spite of gridlock we will grow at 1   or 2%.I don t buy the argument that we are relegated to this effort. We are not this administration can make breakthroughs in taxes and infrastructure ready for reform we have become one of the most bureaucratic confusing litigious societies on the planet it s almost an embarrassment be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country and at one point we have to get our act together. We won t do what were supposed to for the average Americans and unfortunately people write about this like corporations is not corporations competitive taxes are important for business and business growth which is important to jobs in wage growth and we should be making that along to every single one of you every time you talk to a client.VIA: CNBC",politics,"Jul 14, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

"BREAKING: PETER W. SMITH, GOP Operative Who Sought Hillary Clinton’s Missing Emails FOUND DEAD In Hotel Room","The plot thickens Republican donor and operative from Chicago s North Shore who said he had tried to obtain Hillary Clinton s missing emails from Russian hackers killed himself in a Minnesota hotel room days after talking to The Wall Street Journal about his efforts, public records show.In a room at a Rochester hotel used almost exclusively by Mayo Clinic patients and relatives, Peter W. Smith, 81, left a carefully prepared file of documents, which includes a statement police called a suicide note in which he said he was in ill health and a life insurance policy was expiring.Days earlier, the financier from suburban Lake Forest gave an interview to the Journal about his quest, and it published stories about his efforts beginning in late June. The Journal also reported it had seen emails written by Smith showing his team considered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, then a top adviser to Republican Donald Trump s campaign, as an ally. Flynn briefly was President Trump s national security adviser and resigned after it was determined he had failed to disclose contacts with Russia.At the time, the newspaper reported Smith s May 14 death came about 10 days after he granted the interview. Mystery shrouded how and where he had died, but the lead reporter on the stories said on a podcast he had no reason to believe the death was the result of foul play and that Smith likely had died of natural causes.The Journal stories said it was on Labor Day weekend in 2016 that Smith had assembled a team to acquire emails the team theorized might have been stolen from the private server Clinton had used while secretary of state. Smith s focus was the more than 30,000 emails Clinton said she deleted because they related to personal matters. A huge cache of other Clinton emails were made public.Smith told the Journal he believed the missing emails might have had been obtained by Russian hackers. He also said he thought the correspondence related to Clinton s official duties. He told the Journal he worked independently and was not part of the Trump campaign. He also told the Journal he and his team found five groups of hackers   two of them Russian groups   who claimed to have Clinton s missing emails.Smith had a history of doing opposition research, the formal term for unflattering information that political operatives dig up about rival candidates.For years, Democratic President Bill Clinton was Smith s target. The wealthy businessman had a hand in exposing the  Troopergate  allegations about Bill Clinton s sex life. And he discussed financing a probe of a 1969 trip Bill Clinton had taken while in college to the Soviet Union, according to Salon magazine.Smith s death occurred at the Aspen Suites in Rochester, records show. They list the cause of death as  asphyxiation due to displacement of oxygen in confined space with helium. Rochester Police Chief Roger Peterson on Wednesday called his manner of death  unusual,  but a funeral home worker said he d seen it before.An employee with Rochester Cremation Services, the funeral home that responded to the hotel, said he helped remove Smith s body from his room and recalled seeing a tank.However, the Chicago Tribune obtained a Minnesota state death record filed in Olmsted County that says Smith committed suicide in a hotel near the Mayo Clinic at 1:17 p.m. on Sunday, May 14. He was found with a bag over his head with a source of helium attached. A medical examiner s report gives the same account, without specifying the time, and a report from Rochester police further details his suicide.In the note recovered by police, Smith apologized to authorities and said that  NO FOUL PLAY WHATSOEVER  was involved in his death. He wrote that he was taking his own life because of a  RECENT BAD TURN IN HEALTH SINCE JANUARY, 2017  and timing related  TO LIFE INSURANCE OF $5 MILLION EXPIRING. One of Smith s former employees told the Tribune he thought the elderly man had gone to the famed clinic to be treated for a heart condition. Mayo spokeswoman Ginger Plumbo said Thursday she could not confirm Smith had been a patient, citing medical privacy laws.Peter Smith wrote two blog posts dated the day before he was found dead. One challenged U.S. intelligence agency findings that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. Another post predicted:  As attention turns to international affairs, as it will shortly, the Russian interference story will die of its own weight. Chicago Tribune h/t Gary Klug  @garyinlv01 Peter W. Smith tweeted an interesting article on January 16, 2017. The article says Russian hackers did not hack the DNC emails and that the person who hacked them is a Russian named Dmitri Alperovitch who also worked for Barack Obama.Russian ex-national guards U.S. nuclear codes for Obama https://t.co/j0vz8h1Cmx  Peter W. Smith (@PTRSIH) January 16, 2017State of The Nation 2012   Russians did not hack the DNC system, a Russian named Dmitri Alperovitch is the hacker and he works for President Obama. In the last five years the Obama administration has turned exclusively to one Russian to solve every major cyber-attack in America, whether the attack was on the U.S. government or a corporation. Only one  super-hero cyber-warrior  seems to  have the codes  to figure out  if  a system was hacked and by  whom. Dmitri s company, CrowdStrike has been called in by Obama to solve mysterious attacks on many high level government agencies and American corporations, including: German Bundestag, Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the White House, the State Department, SONY, and many others.CrowdStrike s philosophy is:  You don t have a malware problem; you have an adversary problem. CrowdStrike has played a critical role in the development of America s cyber-defense policy. Dmitri Alperovitch and George Kurtz, a former head of the FBI cyberwarfare unit founded CrowdStrike. Shawn Henry, former executive assistant director at the FBI is now CrowdStrike s president of services. The company is crawling with former U.S. intelligence agents.Before Alperovitch founded CrowdStrike in 2011, he was working in Atlanta as the chief threat officer at the antivirus software firm McAfee, owned by Intel (a DARPA company). During that time, he  discovered  the Chinese had compromised at least seventy-one companies and organizations, including thirteen defense contractors, three electronics firms, and the International Olympic Committee. He was the only person to notice the biggest cyberattack in history! Nothing suspicious about that.Alperovitch and the DNCAfter CrowdStrike was hired as an independent  vendor  by the DNC to investigate a possible cyberattack on their system, Alperovitch sent the DNC a proprietary software package called Falcon that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. According to Alperovitch, Falcon  lit up,  within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC. Alperovitch had his  proof  in TEN SECONDS that Russia was in the network. This  alleged  evidence of Russian hacking has yet to be shared with anyone.As Donald Trump has pointed out, the FBI, the agency that should have been immediately involved in hacking that effects  National Security,  has yet to even examine the DNC system to begin an investigation. Instead, the FBI and 16 other U.S.  intelligence  agencies simply  agree  with Obama s most trusted  cyberwarfare  expert Dmitri Alperovitch s  TEN SECOND  assessment that produced no evidence to support the claim.Also remember that it is only Alperovitch and CrowdStrike that claim to have evidence that it was Russian hackers. In fact, only two hackers were found to have been in the system and were both identified by Alperovitch as Russian FSB (CIA) and the Russian GRU (DoD). It is only Alperovitch who claims that he knows that it is Putin behind these two hackers.Alperovitch failed to mention in his conclusive  TEN SECOND  assessment that Guccifer 2.0 had already hacked the DNC and made available to the public the documents he hacked   before Alperovitch did his ten second assessment. Alperovitch reported that no other hackers were found, ignoring the fact that Guccifer 2.0 had already hacked and released DNC documents to the public. Alperovitch s assessment also goes directly against Julian Assange s repeated statements that the DNC leaks did not come from the Russians.The ridiculously fake cyber-attack assessment done by Alperovitch and CrowdStrike na vely flies in the face of the fact that a DNC insider admitted that he had released the DNC documents. Julian Assange implied in an interview that the murdered Democratic National Committee staffer, Seth Rich, was the source of a trove of damaging emails the website posted just days before the party s convention. Seth was on his way to testify about the DNC leaks to the FBI when he was shot dead in the street.It is also absurd to hear Alperovitch state that the Russian FSB (equivalent to the CIA) had been monitoring the DNC site for over a year and had done nothing. No attack, no theft, and no harm was done to the system by this  false-flag cyber-attack  on the DNC   or at least, Alperovitch  reported  there was an attack. The second hacker, the supposed Russian military (GRU   like the U.S. DoD) hacker, had just entered the system two weeks before and also had done  nothing  but observe.It is only Alperovitch s word that reports that the Russian FSB was  looking for files on Donald Trump.  It is only this false claim that spuriously ties Trump to the  alleged  attack. It is also only Alperovitch who believes that this hack that was supposedly  looking for Trump files  was an attempt to  influence  the election. No files were found about Trump by the second hacker, as we know from Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0 s leaks. To confabulate that  Russian s hacked the DNC to influence the elections  is the claim of one well-known Russian spy. Then, 17 U.S. intelligence agencies unanimously confirm that Alperovitch is correct   even though there is no evidence and no investigation was ever conducted.How does Dmitri Alperovitch have such power? Why did Obama again and again use Alperovitch s company, CrowdStrike, when they have miserably failed to stop further cyber-attacks on the systems they were hired to protect? Why should anyone believe CrowdStrikes false-flag report?After documents from the DNC continued to leak, and Guccifer 2.0 and Wikileaks made CrowdStrike s report look foolish, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than he had reported. He single-handedly concluded that the Russians were conducting an  influence operation  to help win the election for Trump. This false assertion had absolutely no evidence to back it up.On July 22, three days before the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks dumped a massive cache of emails that had been  stolen  (not hacked) from the DNC. Reporters soon found emails suggesting that the DNC leadership had favored Hillary Clinton in her primary race against Bernie Sanders, which led Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC chair, along with three other officials, to resign.Just days later, it was discovered that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) had been hacked. CrowdStrike was called in again and once again, Alperovitch immediately  believed  that Russia was responsible. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author. Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0 s website. This time Guccifer released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, Guccifer went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress.Once again, Guccifer 2.0 proved Alperovitch and CrowdStrike s claims to be grossly incorrect about the hack originating from Russia, with Putin masterminding it all. Nancy Pelosi offered members of Congress Alperovitch s suggestion of installing Falcon, the system that failed to stop cyberattacks at the DNC, on all congressional laptops.Key Point: Once Falcon was installed on the computers of members of the U.S. Congress, CrowdStrike had even further full access into U.S. government accounts.Obama   No Friend of AmericaObama is no friend of America in the war against cyber-attacks. The very agencies and departments being defended by Michael Alperovitch s  singular and most brilliant  ability to write encryption codes have all been successfully attacked and compromised since Michael set up the codes. But we shouldn t worry, because if there is a cyberattack in the Obama administration, Michael s son Dmitri is called in to  prove  that it isn t the fault of his father s codes. It was the  damn Russians , or even  Putin himself  who attacked American networks.Not one of the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies is capable of figuring out a successful cyberattack against America without Michael and Dmitri s help. Those same 17 U.S. intelligence agencies were not able to effectively launch a successful cyberattack against Russia. It seems like the Russian s have strong codes and America has weak codes. We can thank Michael and Dmitri Alperovitch for that.It is clear that there was no DNC hack beyond Guccifer 2.0. Dmitri Alperovitch is a  frontman  for his father s encryption espionage mission.Is it any wonder that Trump says that he has  his own people  to deliver his intelligence to him that is outside of the infiltrated U.S. government intelligence agencies and the Obama administration? Isn t any wonder that citizens have to go anywhere BUT the MSM to find real news or that the new administration has to go to independent news to get good intel?It is hard to say anything more damnable than to again quote Dmitri on these very issues:  If someone steals your keys to encrypt the data, it doesn t matter how secure the algorithms are.

EXTRAORDINARY DETAILS EMERGE About How Senator John McCain Got “Dirty Dossier” On President Trump From Ex-Spy…Where’s The Media Outrage?,"Where was the media s outrage when a sitting United States senator, John McCain went on a wild goose chase, that led him overseas, in an effort to obtain what he believed was incriminating evidence that could be used to harm President Trump? How is it okay for Senator John McCain to actively seek dirt on a sitting president, but not okay for Donald Trump Jr. (who is NOT a government official) to meet with a Russian lawyer in an attempt to discover potential dirt on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton?Sen. John McCain commented on Tuesday about Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with the Russian lawyer. How serious do you think this particular shoe is?  Raju asked, referring to Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya after being promised dirt on Clinton that was reportedly part of a Russian government effort. I don t know. But it s certainly another shoe that s dropped that needs to be pursued and looked at,  McCain said.  TPMWatch RINO Senator John McCain express his concern overt the seriousness of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with the Russian lawyer about the lifting US sanctions on Russian adoption. It s curious that the reporter never asked McCain about his efforts to smear our president with a unsubstantiated dirty dossier from an ex-spy:Before we go any further into the messy details of John McCain s international dealings to find dirt on our sitting president, it s worth mentioning that as far as we know, no one was murdered as a result of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who entered the US without a visa under  extraordinary circumstances  thanks to the efforts of Barack Obama s DOJ. The same cannot be said about McCain s dealings with the  dirty dossier  on Trump. Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya is also said to have ties to Fusion GPS, the sketchy secretive Washington firm that commissioned the dubious intelligence dossier on Donald Trump.According to the Daily Caller   The Russian lawyer who offered Donald Trump Jr. damaging information about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reportedly has ties to the opposition research firm that commissioned the dossier on President Donald Trump.When the June 2016 meeting took place, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was in New York to defend Prevezon, a Russian holding firm accused of laundering money for corrupt Russian businessmen. Veselnitskaya had been working on the case for years with assistance from Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that compiled the Trump dossier.Fusion GPS denied any knowledge of, or role in, facilitating the meeting between Veselnitskaya and Trump Jr.According to The Sun: A FORMER KGB spy chief suspected of helping Brit spook Christopher Steele compile the Trump  dirty dossier  has been found dead in his car under mysterious circumstances.Oleg Erovinkin, described as a key source behind the widely discredited document, was found dead in the back of his car in Moscow on Boxing Day.Today, the Daily Mail reports: Sen. John McCain said he did  what any citizen would do  in turning over the dirty dossier, which contained unconfirmed secrets about the president-elect, over to the FBI.The Guardian charted the path of how the dossier came to be and how it was that McCain got his hands on the controversial documents.In turn, that firm outsourced the research to a  retired western European former counter-intelligence official, with a long history of dealing with the shadow world of Moscow s spooks and siloviki (securocrats),  explained the Guardian.Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal identified the ex-spy as Christopher Steele.The Guardian pointed out that just because a Democrat was willing to pay for the information that didn t mean that said Democrat was Hillary Clinton s campaign or the Democratic National Committee.Sometimes donors seek out this information in order to ensure they ve made a sound investment.***Yeah okay!***The contractor, who the Guardian didn t name, but the Wall Street Journal identified as Steele, reportedly found the information that he dug up to be concerning. He and another ex-British diplomat, Christopher Burrows, run their own company, Orbis Business Intelligence. If the allegations were real, their implications were overwhelming,  the Guardian wrote.On November 18, at the Halifax International Security Forum, McCain was introduced to a  former senior western diplomat  who had set eyes on the documents and knew who put them together, telling the Arizona Republican that the individual was  highly reliable. That man can now be named as Sir Andrew Wood, British ambassador to Moscow from 1995 to 2000.Wood told the Independent that he had met McCain, spoken to him about Trump, and about the potential for him to be compromised.In a carefully nuanced statement he said:  Yes I did meet Senator McCain and his aides at the conference. We spoke about the kind of activities the Russians can be engaged in. We also spoke about how Mr Trump may find himself in a position where there could be an attempt to blackmail him with Kompromat [a Russian term for compromising material] and claims that there were audio and video tapes in existence.   He added:  I would like to stress that I did not pass on any dossier to Senator McCain or anyone else and I did not see a dossier at the time. I do know Christopher Steele and in my view he is very professional and thorough in what he does. He did not however address whether he told McCain there was a dossier   and how to get it.Clearly, somebody did.From there, McCain dispatched a  trusted emissary  who flew across the Atlantic to meet the source of the documents at an airport that the Guardian did not name.The aide was instructed to look for a man with a copy of the Financial Times and that s how the individuals met, with the source taking McCain s emissary back to his house and giving the American a copy of the documents.Within 24 hours, the dossier was in Washington, though the contents of the file couldn t be verified without an investigation.  McCain, the Guardian said, was worried that his actions might be interpreted as revenge for some of the controversial comments Trump made about him   such as knocking the fact that the longtime senator had been a prisoner of war.However, McCain decided to hand over the documents to FBI Director James Comey on December 9. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI,  McCain said Wednesday in a statement about that matter. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue,  McCain said.For entire story: Daily Mail ",politics,"Jul 13, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"OBAMA’S DOJ LET Russian Lawyer Into U.S. WITHOUT A VISA Under “Extraordinary Circumstances” Before She Met With Donald Trump Jr…Lawyer Has Ties To Left-Wing Democrat Activist, Major Hillary Supporter","In July of 2016, Donald Trump, Jr. met a 42-year-old Russian attorney named Natalia Veselnitskaya who had promised him damaging information about then-candidate Hillary Clinton. One of his father s contacts, a music publicist named Rob Goldstone, had arranged the meeting as a favor to a client of his, the Azeri real estate developer and pop singer Emin. Goldstone had worked with the Trumps on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. There were other reasons to take the meeting, too: Emin s father, Aras Agalarov, is the 51st-richest man in Russia and an instrumental figure in the President s aborted foray into Russian real estate: the Moscow tower he tried and failed to erect.Trump Jr. has said he knew absolutely nothing about Veselnitskaya before their meeting, not even her name. She turned out to use the promise of information that could help his father s campaign as a pretext to discuss reinstating a popular Russian-American adoption program, according to his version of events. What could be more harmless?In fact, Veselnitskaya was already a key figure for the defense in one of the most notorious money-laundering scandals in recent memory, encompassing $230 million in public funds allegedly stolen from the Russians by a network of corrupt bureaucrats and routed into real estate sales, including some in Manhattan, through ironclad Swiss bank accounts. And she was accused of lobbying U.S. officials for a Russian NGO that sought to overturn the Russian ban on U.S. adoptions, according to a complaint filed with the U.S. Justice Department and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA).-TPMThe Hill -The Russian lawyer who penetrated Donald Trump s inner circle was initially cleared into the United States by the Justice Department under  extraordinary circumstances  before she embarked on a lobbying campaign last year that ensnared the president s eldest son, members of Congress, journalists and State Department officials, according to court and Justice Department documents and interviews.This revelation means it was the Obama Justice Department that enabled the newest and most intriguing figure in the Russia-Trump investigation to enter the country without a visa.Later, a series of events between an intermediary for the attorney and the Trump campaign ultimately led to the controversy surrounding Donald Trump Jr.Just five days after meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with Trump Jr., Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Moscow attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya showed up in Washington in the front row of a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Russia policy, video footage of the hearing shows.Veselnitskaya also attended a dinner with the chairman of the House subcommittee overseeing Russia policy, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and roughly 20 other guests at a dinner club frequented by Republicans.Rohrabacher said he believed Veselnitskaya and her U.S. colleagues, which included former Rep. Ronald Dellums (D-Calif.), were lobbying other lawmakers to reverse the Magnitsky Act and restore the ability of Americans to adopt Russian children that Moscow had suspended.Daily Caller   Radical left-wing icon former California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums was a hired lobbyist for Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. June 9, 2016, the Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group has learned.Dellums, who represented liberal San Francisco and Oakland, Calif., is a long-time darling of left-wing political activists. He served 13 terms in Congress as an African-American firebrand and proudly called himself a socialist. He retired in 1996.The former congressman is one of several high-profile Democratic partisans who was on Veselnitskaya s payroll, working to defeat a law that is the hated object of a personal vendetta waged by Russian President Vladimir Putin.Former Democratic Congressman and Oakland, CA Mayor Ronald Dellums endorsed Hillary Clinton for President against Barack Obama in 2008:Ronald Dellums endorsed Hillary again in 2016. I don t think this was very heavily lobbied at all compared with the other issues we deal with,  Rohrabacher said.As for his former congressional colleague Dellums, Rohrabacher said he recalled having a conversation about the Magnitsky Act and the adoption issue:  Ron and I like each other   I have to believe he was a hired lobbyist but I don t know. Here s how Veselnitskaya is tied to the massive 2013 money laundering scheme and the controversial piece of legislation: 2012 s Magnitsky Act that involved Denis Katsyv, the son of Russian railroad baron Petr Katsyv and owner of the Prevezon group. It was the Magnitsky Act that Veselnitskaya allegedly discussed in her meeting with Donald Trump Jr.:TPM    In 2013, Veselnitskaya agreed to represent Denis Katsyv, The younger Katsyv was accused of collaborating with corrupt Russian officials in the money-laundering scheme. Then-U.S. attorney and  Sheriff of Wall Street  Preet Bharara (who was appointed US Attorney in Manhattan by Barack Obama and was fired by President Trump in March) led the charge against Prevezon; the company, his office said, had used cash from the theft to buy condos in Bharara s jurisdiction.Katsyv had been Veselnitskaya s highest-profile client by far, and his defense would be a world-historic success not just for the wealthy real estate investor, but for the Russian establishment under President Vladimir Putin.Until this weekend, the closest Veselnitskaya had come to the public eye was as a footnote to the compounding scandal of the Prevezon affair. Veselnitskaya had come to the United States with Katsyv, who was to be deposed by Bharara s team. Not only wasn t she deposed herself, she didn t attend her client s deposition in person. But after the deposition, she moved to the Plaza Hotel for the remaining two nights of her stay at a cost of $995 per night. Her firm then billed the U.S. government for the entire stay, as well as a single meal for five that included eight grappas, two bottles of wine, eighteen dishes and a bill that came to nearly $800. The group s total expenses topped $50,000, and they promised to file more.The legal proceedings in which Veselnitskaya was enmeshed contain a spy novel s-worth of twists, turns and tragic, suspicious accidents. Sergei Magnitsky, a whistleblowing accountant who called attention to Russian bureaucrats  alleged widespread embezzlement, was arrested and detained without trial for nearly a year until his death in 2009 from what prison staff described as  pancreonecrosis, ruptured abdominal membrane and toxic shock,  according to the U.S. government s suit against Prevezon. The Russian Interior Ministry later revised the cause of death to heart failure. When Magnitsky s family examined his body, they found bruises and that his fingers had been broken, according to an early draft of a report by then-president Dmitry Medvedev s own investigative committee.The incident led to a controversial piece of legislation: 2012 s Magnitsky Act, which sanctioned 18 Russian officials believed by the US to have been involved in Magnitsky s death. Five days later, the Russian parliament voted to ban adoptions of Russian children by Americans, a move understood to be retaliation for the Magnitsky Act. Putin, by that time president of Russia again, also began to compile an  anti-Magnitsky  list of his own, according to the New York Times. Bharara was among the prominent names on it.Magnitsky s death, and the original theft by Russian bureaucrats, are believed by many, including Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), to be the work of the Klyuev Group, a network of criminals working in the Russian government to enrich themselves at the expense of Russian citizens (its exploits are chronicled in English in a number of articles by reporter Michael Weiss). Magnitsky and others sought to expose what they believed was hundreds of millions of dollars  worth of graft by the group.The suit against Prevezon never went to trial. On March 11, Donald Trump fired Bharara, and on March 21, Nikolai Gorokhov, the Magnitsky family s attorney and a key witness for the prosecution, fell from the fourth floor of an apartment building, apparently when a rope broke while he and others were trying to move a bathtub in through the window. He sustained head injuries.

"WATCH: STONE-FACED ANDERSON COOPER Gets Schooled By Trump’s Deputy Assistant On Fake News…”I know you want salacious, sensational coverage for your ratings, so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money but that’s not media”","President Trump s deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka appeared on Anderson Cooper s 360 show, where he admonished the network for making up news about the Trump administration being  in crisis  and that they were in  bunker mentality  following the news story that broke about a June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian Lawyer who promised dirt on Hillary, but instead wanted to talk about Russian adoptions. Gorka told Cooper, It s laughable. Your chyron talked about a bunker mentality. I actually work in the West Wing, I work in the White House. It is absolutely nothing of the kind, Trump s Deputy Assistant continued,  We are pushing the  Make America Great Again  agenda, the president is a steam locomotive that cannot be stopped, it s just fake news. I m sad to see CNN fall to this. Gorka continued with his tongue-lashing of CNN s stone-faced host Cooper Anderson:  I know you want salacious, sensational coverage for your ratings, so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money but that s not media, that s not reportage, it s just fake news. Cooper, remained surprisingly stoic as Gorka outed CNN s real agenda, which is clearly not reporting actual news, but instead, chasing ratings and ultimately money from advertisers. When Gorka appeared to be finished, Cooper replied,  Okay, I m just going to ignore the insults because I don t think it gets us anywhere.  Gorka quickly replied saying,  It s not about you, its about actually having journalism back on TV. Where are the Walter Cronkite s of yesteryear? This is just about ratings and money.

This interview between Gorka and Camerota went from cordial to personal really quickly! Alison Camerota asked about Iraqi forces defeating ISIS to win back the city of Mosul.

Camerota said Gorka was the one who asked to appear on the network.Camerota responded:  OK.

The amount of time you spend in desperation on a topic that has plummeted you to 13th place in viewership ranking across America, more people watch Nick at Nite cartoons than CNN today.

WHOA! NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts Was “Hacked” By Obama Regime In Same Surveillance Program That Spied On Private Citizen Donald Trump,"Meanwhile, in virtually every media outlet across America, Trump Trump Trump and Russia Russia Russia!Evidence shows that John Roberts, chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, was  hacked  by a Deep State surveillance operation overseen by Obama administration CIA director John Brennan and Obama director of national intelligence James Clapper.Roberts, the Bush appointee who made the decisive vote to uphold the constitutionality of Obamacare before the 2012 election, was allegedly the victim of the same Deep State surveillance program that spied on President Donald Trump.Tapes released by Federal Judge G. Murray Snow   preserved on a Whistleblower Soundcloud page   show real estate billionaire Timothy Blixseth explaining Brennan and Clapper s surveillance program to Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and detective Mike Zullo. The existence of this surveillance program has been corroborated by Wikileaks   Vault 7  release and by the public comments of former CIA and NSA contractor Dennis Montgomery, who says he worked on the program for Brennan and Clapper.Montgomery has gone public with his claims exposing how the program was used to spy on President Donald Trump when he was a private citizen. Montgomery has gained immunity and desperately wants House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes or other lawmakers to call him to testify about what he knows.On the explosive tapes, Blixseth walks Arpaio and Zullo through the details of the program on a computer screen. At one point, the three begin pulling up specific names of targeted individuals.LISTEN TO TAPES (at the 18 minute mark HERE) You know who that guy is? That s the head of the FISA court they hacked into, Reggie Walton,  Blixseth tells the investigators. John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, was hacked,  Blixseth tells Arpaio and Zullo.Insiders have always been skeptical of Roberts  motives for siding with President Obama on the 2012 Obamacare case. While there s still no available evidence that Roberts was blackmailed, the allegation that he was  hacked  by Obama officials provides some more context into the justice s controversial career.As Big League Politics reported, former FBI director James Comey seized and buried volumes of information that demonstrated this wide-ranging government surveillance operation targeting Donald Trump before he became president.For entire story: Big League Politics",politics,"Jul 12, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

"MORE WINNING! After 14 Year Ban, China Welcomes Back US Beef To Their Multibillion-Dollar Market"," You re gonna be so proud of your country. We re gonna win so much. We re gonna win at every level. We re gonna win so much, you may even get tired of winning. You may even get so tired of winning, and you ll say,  Please, please it s too much winning! We can t take it anymore. Mr. President, it s too much!    Candidate Donald Trump, May, 2016President Trump tweeted about an exciting new opportunity for US cattle farmers, as China lifts 14 year ban on American beef imports: After 14 years, U.S. beef hits Chinese market. Trade deal an exciting opportunity for agriculture. During his Senate hearing to be confirmed as ambassador to China, then-Gov. Terry Branstad said he would prefer to serve Iowa beef   not cuts from Australia   at the U.S. Embassy there.He won t get that wish yet, but the prime rib he slices into Friday when joined in Beijing by U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Chinese government officials to ceremonially mark the return of U.S. beef to China after a 14-year ban will be from closer to home   Nebraska.The meat shipped last week by a South Omaha meatpacker was reported to be the first shipment of U.S. beef to China since 2003 after officials sealed a long-sought trade deal this month. This is a big deal. It s definitely very positive news,  said Lee Schulz, an Iowa State University Extension livestock economist.But Schulz cautioned overcoming the political hurdles that had prevented U.S. beef exports to China over fears associated with mad cow disease are only the first step. It will be some time before American beef becomes  it s what s for dinner  for nearly 1.4 billion Chinese.He described the Chinese market for U.S. beef as  in its infancy  in terms of its impact on Iowa and U.S. producers and processors.The market today is  very different  from 2003, according to Chris Freland, executive director of the Iowa Beef Industry Council. Still, what she saw while visiting China earlier this year makes her believe U.S. beef producers have  an exciting opportunity  to move into the Chinese market. There are a lot of people there   and a rising middle class who can add beef to their diet,  she said.China is projected to become the largest beef market in the world and a major destination for U.S. beef products, according to American Farm Bureau Federation economist Katelyn McCullock. Adding to the market potential is China s changing taste, McCullock said.In 2003, much of the market there was offal   tongues, kidneys and livers, for example. Today, there has been demand for higher-value  muscle cuts  or steak.Before China closed the door on U.S. beef, it imported $70 million worth of beef annually, with the United States supplying 80 percent of that. Today, China imports about $2.6 billion worth of beef every year. Last year, Chinese beef imports totaled 601,000 tons and demand is expected to increase ninefold in four years. So if we can even have a portion of that coming back for Iowa producers, that s a celebration for producer profitability,  Freland said.For entire story: The Gazette ",politics,"Jul 12, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
BREAKING: Michigan Native KID ROCK Announces He’s Running For US Senate,"Kid Rock, aka Robert (Bob) Ritchie, a native of Michigan who was born and raised in my hometown of Romeo, just announced on Twitter that he s running for US Senate. As a kid, I remember frequently sitting across from the Ritchie family in our local Catholic church. Kid Rock is a philanthropist who s done so much to help those in need in the city of Detroit. He s also very passionate about supporting our troops. Ritchie s made several overseas trips to play for our troops, and even donated specially designed homes for disabled veterans. Ritchie (Kid Rock) has not yet announced which party he ll be aligning himself with. He s been a staunch supporter of Republican presidential candidates in the past like Mitt Romney, Ben Carson and after he won the GOP primary, Kid Rock got behind Donald Trump. In 2013, Ritchie told Rolling Stones that he considers himself more of a libertarian. Stay tuned I have had a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real  https://t.co/RRVgISDFeq The answer is an absolute YES. pic.twitter.com/uYCUg6mjW1  Kid Rock (@KidRock) July 12, 2017Rock is one of the most prominent right-leaning voices in music, but he s also a somewhat irregular Republican:  I don t like the hardcore views on either side and I m not in bed with anybody,  he told Rolling Stone in 2013.  I d probably be more libertarian, but I m a firm believer you have to pick a side. I can t be playing the middle. If Rock runs as a Republican, he ll be up against Trump s Michigan Campaign Chair, Lena Epstein for the GOP nomination.Lena is a candidate the left will have a very hard time defeating. She s Jewish, she s a Harvard grad, and she s a tough-minded, successful business woman who wasn t afraid to jump in and support Trump from the moment he announced he was running. Rock may have his hands full with the very popular Lena Epstein, who we believe has the ability to defeat the very liberal Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow.  Rock has the star power, but many will question if he s really got what it takes to run for US Senate.CBS Sunday Morning attempts to find out who badass rocker Kid Rock really is in this interview:And for those who might be saying (or thinking) Kid Rock running for Senate is crazy or ridiculous.

Hamann s Facebook post reveals just how fearful Democrats are of real change in government. President Trump has managed to get under the skin of and expose the truth nature behind the most intolerant group of people America. Not since the civil rights era have we seen such hatred towards anyone who is unlike them. Unfortunately for the Democrats, the hate that these government officials and Hollywood celebrities are spewing every day isn t going to help them to regain power. Contrary to what they believe, Americans are leaving the Democrat Party in droves, as they are waking up to the fact that these individuals are not only okay with using violence and vulgarity to shut down anyone who disagrees with them, but they are also the least tolerant and divisive group of people in America.Daily Caller -A Democratic state lawmaker in Maine appears to have made a death threat against President Trump. Trump is a half term president, at most, especially if I ever get within 10 feet of that pussy,  Rep. Scott Hamann wrote in a lengthy Facebook tirade on Tuesday.Hamann, who represents a district in South Portland and also works as project manager for a food bank, appears to have been responding to another Facebook user who expressed support for Trump.Hamann accused Trump of being  anti-American,  and an  admitted rapist  who was  installed by the Russians.

House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, to take action against him.Press Herald   Hamann has since removed the post from his Facebook page, but the Maine Republican Party was able to make a copy before he did so. In the closing sentence Hamann writes,  Trump is a half term president, at most, especially if I ever get within 10 feet of that pussy. Hamann, who is serving his third term in the Legislature, also lashes out at Trump s supporters and makes reference to the president s controversial statements about women and Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain, a prisoner of war survivor who was held in Vietnam. He s an admitted rapist,  Hamann wrote of the president.  Would you be okay with leaving him alone in a room with your wife? Demi Kouzounas, the chairwoman of the Maine Republican Party, issued a statement calling Hamann  unhinged and dangerous. Words cannot even begin to describe the level of revulsion I feel after reading Rep. Scott Hamann s recent tirade that has come to light,  Kouzounas said in a prepared statement.

GRASSLEY DEMANDS ANSWERS ON TRUMP JR SETUP: Russian Lawyer Tied to DNC Firm…Who Allowed Russian Lawyer Into US After Denied Visa Entry? [Video],"Republican Senator Charles Grassley wants answers on why the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. was allowed in the US after her visa had been denied. Grassley, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on  Fox & Friends  that she  magically appeared  in the US. Grassley has written to the Secretary of State and DHS Secretary in an effort to get to the bottom of this mystery.The second curious connection is that the DNC opposition research firm, Fusion GPS, is connected to the Russian Lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Remember that Fusion GPS is responsible for the Trump-Russia Dossier that made scurrilous claims against President Trump including the  golden showers  incident:Circa News Reports: Fusion has been a major focal point of the FBI and Congress because it hired a former British intelligence agent named Christopher Steele to produce a salacious intelligence dossier that made wild and still unsubstantiated claims about Trump ties to Russia.Does anyone else find it curious that this woman claimed to have dirt on Clinton but never produced a thing. Was she told to just say that to get Donald Jr. to meet with her in a set up? Her Facebook profile shows anti-Trump leanings so why would someone anti-Trump want to deliver information to Donald Trump Jr? Also, once they met, she talked about foreign adoption and had nothing on Clinton go figure  Sara Carter of Circa News reported:Russian lawyer who got inside Donald Trump s inner circle had been denied US visa https://t.co/d3Dg59CRM8  Sara A. Carter (@SaraCarterDC) July 9, 2017The US government s immigration policy prevented this woman from coming here but how did she get into the US after being denied? Is our immigration policy that full of holes or is this just more monkey business from the Obama administration and the DNC? One key clue is that the three lawyers arguing in court for the lawyer s entry to the US are all known anti-Trump guys. In particular is the lawyer that Trump had to fire.

DETROIT SCHOOLS CHIEF Wants To Shut Down Charter Schools Ranked “Best In The State” To Focus On Public Schools Ranked “Worst Urban School District In Country”,"Liberal logic 101 The new superintendent for Detroit s public schools said he will recommend the school district no longer authorize charter schools and focus instead on improving its conventional schools, according to the Detroit Free Press. We have to get it right with traditional public schools and our focus, our energy, our resources need to be on that,  Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told the Free Press.Hechinger Report   Since 1994, there has been an extreme decline in Detroit Public Schools  enrollment: 73 percent. This has had a huge impact on the financial stability of the district and the performance of its remaining schools. However, the expansion of charter schools is just one reason for the decline in enrollment. During that same time, the overall population in the city declined by 33 percent. In addition, the district lost a considerable number of students to inter-district choice programs with neighboring school districts, which enroll more students statewide than charter schools.ForTheRecord says: Two charter schools authorized by Detroit s public schools were rated as the best in the state, according to a report card published by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. The report card examined Michigan s middle and elementary schools and adjusted their rankings to reflect the impact of students  economic background.Detroit s Martin Luther King Jr. Education Center Academy was the top rated elementary and middle school in the state. Ross/Hill Academy was the second-best.Ironically, Detroit s public schools have been rated as the worst large urban school district in the country. In 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015, the National Assessment of Education Progress did assessments and Detroit was rated as the worst in each time.Washington Examiner   According to a highly regarded study, in just one year Michigan charter school students earn an additional two months of learning gains over their traditional public school counterparts. For Detroit, charter students get an additional three months of learning in math and reading when compared to their traditional school peers.Most Michigan charter schools are authorized by state universities, and most conventional public school districts do not authorize any charters.

There is no working phone, email or website.Russian President Vladimir Putin s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the Kremlin is unaware of a meeting between Trump s senior staff and Veselnitskaya and  does not know who that is. Peskov said, No, we don t know who that is and obviously we can t monitor all meetings Russian lawyers hold both in Russia and abroad. Now this Natalia Veselnitskaya was sitting with Obama s Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul during a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, 8 days after cold-contacting Trump Jr. in Trump Tower.Here s a shot showing who appears to be Natalia Veselnitskaya, sitting behind  from the June 14, 2016 Congressional hearing on Russia and the Ukraine.Natalia Veselnitskaya photo:MORE  That looks like Emin Agalarov sitting next to Natalia Veselnitskaya. He was mentioned in Donald Trump Jr s statement this morning. Emin helped set up the meeting with Veselnitskaya.Veselnitskaya was also connected to Fusion GPS, the DNC opposition research firm that produced the fraudulent and discredited Trump Dossier.So why was Veselnitskaya hanging out with Obama officials just days after her meeting with Donald Trump Jr.?And why was Veselnitskaya given a privileged seat up front during the Congressional hearing?

But for many Americans, who are foolish enough to think that inviting millions of Muslim refugees (who have no interest in assimilating) into your neighborhoods and communities, this video should serve as a warning to you of what a bleeding-heart nation looks like post-idiocy:The weather forecast in Sweden vs the weather forecast in Iraq. pic.twitter.com/t870JhVRSU  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) July 11, 2017So, why is Sweden starting to look like a majority Muslim nation? In 1975, the Swedish parliament unanimously decided to change the former homogeneous Sweden into a multicultural country. Forty years later the dramatic consequences of this experiment emerge: violent crime has increased by 300%.If one looks at the number of rapes, however, the increase is even worse. In 1975, 421 rapes were reported to the police; in 2014, it was 6,620. That is an increase of 1,472%.Sweden is now number two on the global list of rape countries. According to a survey from 2010, Sweden, with 53.2 rapes per 100,000 inhabitants, is surpassed only by tiny Lesotho in Southern Africa, with 91.6 rapes per 100,000 inhabitants.Data Also Suggests the Uptick Is Due to Immigrants More controversial is what explains these increases. Some contend the increase in rape is simply a statistical phenomenon due to the application of an expanded definition of rape in 2005 and again in 2013. Others suggest Swedish women have simply grown bolder about reporting things that happened previously but went unreported. Maybe, but in the same period, as Carlqvist and Hedegaard point out,  the number of gang rapes [in Sweden] increased spectacularly.  In rapes of this kind  culprits and victims are most often young and in almost every case, the perpetrators are of immigrant background, mostly from Muslim countries. Finally, it s also worth pointing out that the rise of rape isn t peculiar to Sweden either. The same problem is plaguing Germany, Austria (more information here), Britain, and other EU nations.

WATCH: MSNBC Cuts Mic Of GOP Senator Lindsey Graham When He Brings Up Hillary’s Campaign During Interview About Donald Trump Jr.,"MSNBC s Casey Hunt was interviewing war-hawk and RINO Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about the meeting Donald Trump Jr. on Capitol Hill. Senator Lindsey Graham appeared to be concerned about Trump s decision to meet with the Russian lawyer who ended up only wanting to talk about adoptions. Graham inferred that Trump Jr. made a  rookie mistake  saying,  On it s face, this is very problematic. We cannot allow foreign governments to reach out to anybody s campaign and say  we d like to help you.  That is a non-starter. I know that Donald Trump Jr. is new to politics, I know that Jared Kushner is new to politics, but, um this is gonna require a lot of uh questions to be asked and answered. MSNBC was delighted to hear Lindsey Graham questioning Trump Jr. s judgement in agreeing to take the meeting. Graham continued to express his feelings about the meeting, suggesting that Trump Jr. should have to testify about what transpired in the alleged meeting.  Graham was then asked by the MSNBC reporter,  Do you think the White House has been truthful about the version of events that happened and their meetings that occurred between their associates and the Russians?  Graham responded, It s been very frustrating to find out every couple of weeks about a new meeting. I m sure they met with a lot of people during the campaign. I m sure the Clintons met with  And just like magic, as soon as Hillary s name was mentioned, Graham s mic was cut!And just like that Boom! Mic cut. MSNBC had no issues with their sound while Lindsey Graham (who got less than 1% of support from voters against Donald Trump in a crowded field of GOP candidates during the primaries) was feigning concern over Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with the Russian lawyer, but mention Hillary Clinton, and boom the interview with MSNBC is suddenly over.Watch:",politics,"Jul 11, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
#YouveBeenTrumped…Journalist Who Tried To Nail Donald Trump Jr. On Russia Story For Over A Year Has Full-Scale Meltdown After Trump Jr. Releases Emails On Twitter,"This is the dumbest and biggest crime in the history of American politics. There's not even a close second.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017It turns out little Jared was wrong. The Donald Trump Jr.-Russian collusion story is not only another nothing burger, it lends more credibility to the theory that the media is on an all-out witch hunt for President Donald Trump. Apparently, the hunt has now been extended to include members of the Trump family.Yates Sexton started his rant on Twitter by whining to his followers about chasing the story for a year, and how he got  Trumped  by Don Jr. when, much like his father, Jr. went around the media and took to Twitter to post the emails journalists were desperate to get their hands on.I chased this story for a year and he just tweeted it out.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Whining journalist part 2:Like. I spent hours and days and weeks and months. And his son just, hit tweet.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017More whining:I tracked down sources. Followed so many dead leads. Labored over this. And then, he just, you know, tweeted out the proof.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Still more whining:Like, so many people out there were trying to track this down. And it just got delivered on a tweet. What the hell.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017And you guessed it more whining!It's just so bizarre. As an independent journalist you work crazy hard hoping something will fall into your lap and he tweeted it? 2/  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017And then, the fake relief over the release of the nothing burger emails by none other than Donald Trump Jr. himself:For the record, I'm beside myself in relief that this stuff is out there it's just my god. I cannot believe this.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Yates Sexton then turned his ire on Trump supporters who apparently are (gasp!) laughing at the rabid leftist media who won t let the fake Trump-Russian collusion narrative go:The son of the president just released the smoking gun and the people are laughing about it on the news.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Poor Jared he s, well, he appears to be  baffled  by the Trump s and how they don t follow the rules that have been put forth by the media:This is the most baffling day in a long, long stretch of baffling days.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017And finally, in an appeal to his leftist fans who are surely as heartbroken as him, Yates Sexton suggests that if his followers like his style of dead-end reporting, perhaps they would enjoy paying $22.69 for his book. And now for the final test Will love Trump hate? Will liberals feel help poor little Jared feel better about wasting over a year of his life, while he chased his tail, pinning all of his hopes on being  the one  who finally found the Trump-Russia connection.If you do want to read my reporting, however, here's my book that's out in September.https://t.co/02qE5K9PFv  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017",politics,"Jul 11, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
DONALD TRUMP JR. Releases Emails Related To Russian Lawyer Meeting…Here Are The Nothing Burger Emails The Media Was Salivating Over,"Donald Trump Jr. took to Twitter today to release all email communication with the Kremlin-linked lawyer, revealing that he had hoped to get his hands on information that would damage Hillary Clinton s campaign. Is this really news? Someone who Donald Trump Jr. knew wanted to help him, by revealing some dirt on Hillary, and Trump Jr. agreed to meet with them. Okay? So what? Would Hillary s camp have declined such a meeting? What about Robert Creamer, a felon and Democrat operative who s married to a US Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and had ties to the Hillary campaign and to our sitting President Barack Obama? He was caught red-handed in an undercover video by James O Keefe admitting to inciting violence at Trump rallies as a way to help Hillary win the election against Donald Trump? Why was that story dismissed by the media and this nothingburger story getting wall-to-wall coverage?Here is the tweet from Donald Trump Jr., who was clearly not worried about revealing the contents to the world. Here's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017Here is the statement made by Donald Trump Jr. about the release of the emails:Page 1:Page 2:Page 3:Page 4:The emails offer the first details about how the sitdown with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer, came about.Trump Jr. posted the emails on Twitter shortly after they were first reported by The New York Times.Trump Jr. said in a statement he thought he was receiving opposition research. The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research,  Trump Jr. said. Throughout the exchange, he gave no indication that he was concerned about getting information from the Russian government, which the US intelligence community has concluded meddled in the election on his father s behalf.Trump Jr. and his high-powered white collar criminal defense lawyer, Alan Futerfas, insist he did nothing wrong. Media & Dems are extremely invested in the Russia story. If this nonsense meeting is all they have after a yr, I understand the desperation!  he defiantly tweeted Tuesday morning.The White House has said President Trump was unaware of the meeting, and he has not commented on the revelations about his eldest son.  NYPNot only do the emails appear to be another nothingburger for the rabid left and their allies in the media, but Donald Jr. should ve known that if the media didn t care about Hillary giving Russia one-fifth of all uranium production in the Untied States in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation (slush fund), they likely wouldn t care much else having to do with Crooked Hillary and the Russians.An April, 2015 article published by The New York Times tells a story of a corrupt Secretary of State who used her position as Secretary of State to gain massive donations to her Clinton Foundation while giving Vladimir Putin control of much of the United States uranium:The headline on the website Pravda trumpeted President Vladimir V. Putin s latest coup, its nationalistic fervor recalling an era when its precursor served as the official mouthpiece of the Kremlin:  Russian Nuclear Energy Conquers the World. The article, in January 2013, detailed how the Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, had taken over a Canadian company with uranium-mining stakes stretching from Central Asia to the American West. The deal made Rosatom one of the world s largest uranium producers and brought Mr. Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.But the untold story behind that story is one that involves not just the Russian president, but also a former American president and a woman who would like to be the next one.At the heart of the tale are several men, leaders of the Canadian mining industry, who have been major donors to the charitable endeavors of former President Bill Clinton and his family. Members of that group built, financed and eventually sold off to the Russians a company that would become known as Uranium One.As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.

"TEEN VOGUE Publishes Article To Teach Teen Girls How To Have Anal Sex: “ANAL 101, for teens, beginners”","Two months before the 2016 election, Teen Vogue featured a personal essay by Hillary Clinton, a conversation between Amandla Stenberg and Gloria Steinem, and an interview with Loretta Lynch.In their latest grotesque attempt to make immoral behavior appear to be mainstream for young girls, Teen Vogue asks their young readers. In the article, Gigi Engle suggests that young girls stay away from the internet when it comes to exploring the topic of  anal sex  and instead, rely strictly on Teen Vogue for all of their information. Hmmmm .that s an interesting concept; don t read anything else, just rely on Teen Vogue as your sole source of information. Sounds like indoctrination 101.Here s an excerpt from the article one might expect to find in Penthouse magazine:Teen Vogue   When it comes to your body, it s important that you have the facts. It s not doing your sexual health or self-understanding any favors to keep you in the dark.With that sentiment in mind, we re here to lay it all out for you when it comes to anal sex.Why anal?Anal sex, though often stigmatized and shamed, is a perfectly natural way to engage in sexual activity. People have been having anal sex since the dawn of humanity. Seriously, it s been documented back to the Ancient Greeks and then some. So, if you re a little worried about trying it, or are having trouble understanding the appeal, just know that it isn t weird or gross.In a separate article, Vogue Magazine talks about a makeup manufacturer offering  butt-plugs :OMG https://t.co/Wu0nbw3Wf3  Teen Vogue (@TeenVogue) July 11, 2017Teen Vogue is filled with anti-Trump and anti-Republican propaganda. Scroll through their Twitter feed and you ll be hard pressed to find an article about fashion, makeup tips or how to handle mean girls in middle and high school. Articles like the one below are designed to incite anger and hate towards anyone who doesn t agree with the writers point of view, yet Teen Vogue is being passed off as Vogue magazine for teens.""Tragically, the quality of education around the world is too often determined by race, gender, and zip code."" https://t.co/OEKzvOomK5  Teen Vogue (@TeenVogue) July 11, 2017Here s the same article with a different Tweet that s designed to incite hate and anger towards President Trump and his administration.""This is beyond discriminating against communities of color and low-income students; this is cruel."" https://t.co/bmCOGvStJa  Teen Vogue (@TeenVogue) July 10, 2017How did Teen Vogue become such a radical leftist indoctrination tool for teens?The Atlantic   In May, 29-year-old Elaine Welteroth took over as editor from Amy Astley, who helped found the magazine in 2003. Welteroth, the digital editorial director Phillip Picardi, and the creative director Marie Suter have moved the magazine more aggressively into covering politics, feminism, identity, and activism. Together, the three have shepherded a range of timely, newsy stories, including an interview exploring what it s like to be a Muslim woman facing a Trump presidency, a list of reasons why Mike Pence s record on women s rights and LGBTQ rights should trouble readers, and a video in which two Native American teenagers from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe discuss the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.Teen Vogue was founded in 2003 at the behest of Vogue s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, who tasked Astley, the magazine s beauty editor at the time, to conceive test issues of a spinoff publication for teens. The publication s early focus was fashion.  We are going to do what we do well, which is fashion, beauty, and style,  Astley told The New York Times s David Carr shortly before its launch.  A lot of other teen magazines are focused on relationships, boys, sex, and embarrassing moments. That is not our equity. At the time, Carr noted, many rival teen publications were struggling. And since Teen Vogue debuted, a number of them Elle Girl, CosmoGirl!, Teen People, Teen have folded. * One of the challenges is that teen audiences tend to evolve faster than the adults catering to them can catch up.  It s always been such a volatile market because your audience morphs so rapidly,  John Harrington, a publishing consultant, told The Times in 2013. The genius of the current iteration of Teen Vogue is that it s caught on to its current readers  enthusiasm for topical issues in a timely enough fashion to actually engage them.  I think in 2016 we found our footing and our voice as a publication in a strong way,  Picardi, the publication s digital editorial director, told me via email.  Obviously, the election has provided unique circumstances and a real need for someone to dissect the news for young people. Since we are, in particular, a brand that speaks directly to millions of young women, we have a responsibility to do right by them and view the news through that very specific lens.

KELLYANNE CONWAY Slaps Down Rabid CNN Host Chris Cuomo: “Aren’t you the least bit embarrassed that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America?” [VIDEO],"Chris Cuomo of fake news network CNN interviewed Kellyanne Conway on Sunday. You would have thought by now, these hacks at CNN would have figured out they are no match for the brilliant Kellyanne Conway. At the opening of his interview with Conway, Cuomo attempted to convince the few viewers who still watch CNN that President Trump was  very squishy  on his meeting with Vladimir Putin. Kellyanne Conway snapped back in her usual calm but witty way,  Chris, let s back up. So you re saying you used the word squishy which, itself, is unusual to describe the president s state of mind. So somehow that makes people on CNN insist that the president is never going to raise this with Putin? Why are they still in there?  Cuomo responded,  It s not about CNN. It s about what the president said, Kellyanne.  Kellyanne immediately landed a right hook to fake news host Chris Cuomo when she asked him,  Aren t you the least bit reluctant, if not embarrassed that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America? Cuomo went on to discuss the nothing-burger story about a meeting Donald Trump Jr. had with a Russian lawyer prior to the election. The lawyer allegedly claimed he had information about individuals connected to Russian that were funding the DNC and Hillary. It turns out she was a human rights lawyer who wanted to talk about adoption. But CNN, who suffers from Trump-Russia collusion obsession, is clinging to this story like a squirrel protects its only nut in the dead of winter. Again, Conway delivered another knock out blow saying,  you keep on saying opposition research the way you guys constantly vomit words like collusion and Russian interference and affecting the election, all of which you have no evidence. We cannot convert wishful thinking into hard evidence.

Instead of letting it go, CNN chose instead, to threaten the person who allegedly created the meme.

Infowars has created a CNN meme contest, offering a $20K reward to the winner, as a way to encourage as many people as possible to create memes that expose the fake news network.The internet has provided some pretty funny CNN memes, but so far, the  Liar Liar  video is our favorite.

NEW YORK TIMES Publishes FAKE Story About Donald Trump Jr…Makes Small Retraction At Bottom Of Page,"Here s how fake news works In an effort to cast President Trump s eldest son, Donald Jr. as a liar, The New York Times boldly accused him of giving two different accounts of his meeting with a Russian lawyers. On July 9, 2017, The New York Times headline read: Donald Trump Jr. s Two Different Explanations for Russian MeetingThe NYT s article attempts to paint Donald Trump Jr. as a liar. Ironically, it was The New York Times who was lying: In less than 24 hours, President Trump s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has given two different explanations for a meeting he held during the 2016 campaign with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer who promised to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton.Mr. Trump s meeting with that lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was first reported by The New York Times on Saturday. In response, Mr. Trump said the meeting was brief and focused mostly on the issue of adoption.This was Mr. Trump s statement to the news media on Saturday:It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.The New York Times then offered what they said was a different account of Trump Jr. s original story:Mr. Trump s version of the meeting changed Sunday, when three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it told The Times that Mr. Trump met Ms. Veselnitskaya after she promised to provide damaging information on Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Trump acknowledged on Sunday that Ms. Veselnitskaya offered him information on Mrs. Clinton but that her statements  made no sense  and the information was not  meaningful. Finally, at the BOTTOM of the story in small italic print, the NYT s printed a tiny retraction, stating that they misled their readers:Correction: July 9, 2017 An earlier version of this article misquoted a statement by Donald Trump Jr. about a meeting with a Russian lawyer. He said the meeting mostly focused on the topic of adoption, which  was not a campaign issue.  He did not say it was a campaign issue.

Although there is no confirmed connection yet, he was clearly privy to information that could potentially harm the Democratic Party, and more specifically Hillary Clinton s chances of winning the election in November. Although the DC Police Department ruled the crime a  botched robbery,  nothing was stolen from Rich after he was shot. Many believe that Rich was the person who copied the DNC emails and sent them to Wikileaks via a middle-man. Was Guccifer 2.0 the middle man?Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has strongly hinted that the source for the DNC emails he released was Seth Rich. In this interview with Julian Assange, he seems to suggest on Dutch television program Nieuwsuur that Seth Rich was the source for the Wikileaks-exposed DNC emails and was murdered:On August 9, 2016, Assange offered  a $20K reward for information leading to the conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich. ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) August 9, 2016The report shows the DNC files were copied only 5 days before the unsolved cold-blooded murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich. h/t GPOn Sept. 13, 2016, POLITICO reported on Guccifer 2.0 s alleged hack into the DNC servers:If authentic, the documents would represent the latest strike from the mysterious hacker persona that has already roiled the 2016 election with leaks of documents stolen from the DNC and the House Democrat s campaign arm, the DCCC. Earlier document dumps include the internal communications that forced the resignation of former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz this summer and fueled allegations of party bias against Bernie Sanders.The following statement from FBI Director James Comey seems to back up the assertion that Guccifer 2.0 was not the hacker. Comie testified to Congress that it was the assessment of the FBI that,  hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account.  (like Seth Rich?)According to Fox News   In May, 2016, Guccifer repeatedly claimed to Fox News during a series of interviews that he had successfully breached Clinton s private server. Guccifer made the same claims to NBC News, which published his claims later.In July, when FBI Director James Comey was asked about this claim before Congress, he testified,  He did not [gain access to Clinton s server], he admitted that was a lie. Guccifer 2.0 was arrested and extradited to Romania where he is currently serving time for hacking offenses. In communication from jail, Guccifer 2.0 adamantly refuted the claim that he is Russian or tied to the Russian government via The Hill: I really hope you ve missed me a lot. Though I see they didn t let you forget my name. The U.S. intelligence agencies have published several reports of late claiming I have ties with Russia,  reads the post. I d like to make it clear enough that these accusations are unfounded. I have totally no relation to the Russian government. Guccifer told Fox and NBC News that he breached Clinton s server, but in his May 2016 interview, when pressed by the FBI, Guccifer said the claims were not true. Here are a few key highlights from the bombshell report by The Forensicator that backs up Guccifer 2.0 s claim to FOX and NBC in 2016 that he did NOT hack the DNC emails and offers evidence that the emails were hacked locally (by Seth Rich?) and that the data was copied on a  fairly slow USB flash drive:This study analyzes the file metadata found in a 7zip archive file, 7dc58-ngp-van.7z, attributed to the Guccifer 2.0 persona. For an in depth analysis of various aspects of the controversy surrounding Guccifer 2.0, refer to Adam Carter s blog, Guccifer 2.0: Game Over.Based on the analysis that is detailed below, the following key findings are presented: On 7/5/2016 at approximately 6:45 PM Eastern time, someone copied the data that eventually appears on the  NGP VAN  7zip file (the subject of this analysis). This 7zip file was published by a persona named Guccifer 2, two months later on September 13, 2016. Due to the estimated speed of transfer (23 MB/s) calculated in this study, it is unlikely that this initial data transfer could have been done remotely over the Internet. The initial copying activity was likely done from a computer system that had direct access to the data. By  direct access  we mean that the individual who was collecting the data either had physical access to the computer where the data was stored, or the data was copied over a local high speed network (LAN). They may have copied a much larger collection of data than the data present in the NGP VAN 7zip. This larger collection of data may have been as large as 19 GB. In that scenario the NGP VAN 7zip file represents only 1/10th of the total amount of material taken. This initial copying activity was done on a system where Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) settings were in force. Most likely, the computer used to initially copy the data was located somewhere on the East Coast. The .rar files and plain files that eventually end up in the  NGP VAN  7zip file disclosed by Guccifer 2.0 on 9/13/2016 were likely first copied to a USB flash drive, which served as the source data for the final 7zip file. There is no information to determine when or where the final 7zip file was built.Here are a few key conclusions from the report:Conclusion 6: The initial DNC file collection activity began at approximately 2016-07-05 18:39:02 EDT and ended at 2016-07-05 18:53:17 EDT. This conclusion is supported by the observed last modified times and the earlier conclusion that the ex-filtrated files were copied to a computer located in the Eastern Time zone.Conclusion 7: A transfer rate of 23 MB/s is estimated for this initial file collection operation. This transfer rate can be achieved when files are copied over a LAN, but this rate is too fast to support the hypothesis that the DNC data was initially copied over the Internet (esp. to Romania). This transfer rate can also be achieved when copying directly from a computer s hard drive to a fairly slow USB flash drive; there is a lot variability in USB flash drive speeds. We can shorten this statement and say that the 23 MB/s transfer rate supports the conclusion that the files were initially copied locally and not over the Internet.For an in depth analysis of various aspects of the controversy surrounding Guccifer 2.0, refer to Adam Carter s blog, Guccifer 2.0: Game Over.Here is an excerpt from Guccifer 2.0 s What Happened and When Did It Happen timeline: A lot of people are concerned if I have any links to special services and Russia?I ll tell you that everything I do I do at my own risk. This is my personal project and I m proud of it. Yes, I risk my life. But I know it s worth it. No one knew about me several weeks ago. Nowadays the whole world s talking about me. It s really cool!How can I prove this is true? I really don t know. It seems the guys from CrowdStrike and the DNC would say I m a Russian bear even if I were a catholic nun in fact. At first I was annoyed and disappointed. But now I realize they have nothing else to say. There s no other way to justify their incompetence and failure. It s much easier for them to accuse powerful foreign special services. They just f*cked up! They can prove nothing! All I hear is blah-blah-blah, unfounded theories and somebody s estimates.Specialists from Eastern Europe, Russia, China, India work for the leading IT-companies such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, Apple. There s no surprise that many hackers are descendants from these regions.Almost all recent famous hacker attacks have been attributed to Russia. the researchers supposed that the same instruments were implemented during the attacks. But I d like to reveal a secret to all those cool IT-specialists: all the hackers in the world use almost the same tools. You can buy them or simply find on the web.This line in Guccifer 2.0 s message is very interesting and extremely plausible:Guccifer 2.0 timeline.

VIDEO SHOWS Stunning Damage To Streets Of Historic Hamburg After SOROS’ ANTI-CAPITALISM Cockroaches Cleared Out Of G20 [VIDEO],"New York City s radical leftist Democrat Mayor Bill DeBlasio jetted off to Hamburg, Germany, leaving New Yorker s to deal with their issues, as he joined G-20 protesters who violently rioted, burned and looted the historic city lined with cobblestone streets and beautiful buildings. Not surprisingly, the media was silent about the Mayor of America s largest city, who flew halfway around the world to join the violent, anti-capitalist protesters. The media s focus was instead on Ivanka Trump, who temporarily sat in on a G20 meeting, while her father stepped out for a short period of time.Videos showing anti-capitalist thugs breaking windows of businesses, burning cars, tearing down street signs and looting local stores have been circulating everywhere on the internet. The violent cowardly Antifa groups who are attempting to shut down free speech and threaten supporters of President Trump in America, were seen wearing masks to hide their identities as they ravaged businesses and threatened anyone who got in their way.Watch G20 rioters loot a local store in this stunning video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ_CrspbeSgAfter several days of violent riots, fires in the streets and looting by anti-capitalist punks, citizens of Hamburg woke to find their streets and businesses looking like the aftermath of a war-zone.

CHILLING PHOTO Captures FEMALE SUICIDE BOMBER Carrying Baby Moments Before She Blows Both Of Them Up,"Why would President Trump want America to enforce a travel ban on refugees from terror hotbed nations? Why wouldn t we want to import so many nice, trustworthy people with so many common values and similar customs?At first sight the picture appears to show a mother cradling her young child as she flees an Islamic State-held area of Mosul.But a closer look reveals she is holding a trigger., which she will pull seconds later.An Iraqi TV station captured the moment before a suspected female Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) suicide bomber blew herself   and the baby   up near Iraqi troops.She had apparently tried to detonate an explosives vest hidden under her hijab as she passed the soldiers, but it failed to go off until she had walked some distance away, a cameraman for al-Mawsleya TV said.She was killed along with her child, while two soldiers and several civilians were injured.The station had been filming the battle between Iraqi troops and Isil fighters and did not realise what they had caught on camera until they reviewed their footage later.The jihadists have used everything in their arsenal to fend off the troops in the final throes of the nine month-long offensive.Isil s use of female suicide bombers in battle, while not new, is exceedingly rare and demonstrates the group s desperation.More than 20 female suicide bombers hiding among civilians are believed to have detonated explosives in the last two weeks.One general claimed they were even using their own children as human shields. The women are fighting with their children right beside them,  Lieutenant General Sami al-Aridi said.  It s making us hesitant to use air strikes, to advance. If it weren t for this we could be finished in just a few hours. Preventing the attacks has proved difficult. Iraq s socially conservative culture means soldiers do not ask women to lift up their clothes to check for explosives as they do men.

SERIOUSLY INJURED Cop Sues Black Lives Matter…Does He Have A Case?,"This group of Black Lives Matter supporters marched at the Minnesota State Fair chanting,  Pigs in a blanket, fry  em like bacon!  The media, and the former President Barack Obama ignored it.Watch:Watch Michael Brown s stepfather encourage BLM rioters to burn down the city of Ferguson, MO:Daily Mail   Black Lives Matter and five of its leaders are being sued by a Baton Rouge cop who blames them for  inciting  Gavin Eugene Long s murderous rampage in the city last summer.The officer has not been named, but his description matches that of East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff s Deputy Nicholas Tullier, 42, who suffered severe brain damage in the attack.Tullier, a father of two, was shot in the head, shoulder and neck, and was left in a vegetative state.He has since returned to consciousness, regained some motor control and can now communicate non-verbally.His attacker, 29-year-old Long, was shot dead by a SWAT team member around ten minutes after the mass shooting began.Long, a black military veteran, shot six officers, killing three and seriously injuring one, on July 17 last year in response to the shooting of unarmed black man Alton Sterling by white cops.The suit, filed on Friday, says that BLM leaders  incited violence  in retaliation for the death of black men killed by police  and its denunciations of the attacks came  all but too late , CBS News reported.Long had left a note before the shooting in which he said he wanted to hurt  bad cops as well as good cops in hopes that the good cops (which are the majority) will be able to stand together and enact justice and punishment against bad cops. He also said in a YouTube video that he was only affiliated with  the spirit of justice. Don t affiliate me with nothing,  he said.  Yeah, I was also a Nation of Islam member, I m not affiliated with it  They ll try to put you with ISIS or some other terrorist group   no. Among the five BLM members named in the suit is DeRay Mckesson, 31, a former school administrator turned civil rights activist.The suit claims that Mckesson, who took part in nightly protests after Sterling s death on July 5, was  in charge of  a march on July 9 that turned into a  riot.

HILARIOUS! CNN President Jeff Zucker Is Hitler [VIDEO],"CNN s ratings have been in the toilet ever since they made falsifying news about our President and his nonexistent Russian connection a top priority. Earlier this week, CNN sunk to a new low when they threatened to release the identity of a private user on social media site Reddit, after he made a video showing President Trump body-slamming a CNN logo superimposed over the WWE Chairman s body. Perhaps it s a good time for CNN to think about replacing their vengeful, bully president CNN s president, Jeff Zucker, responded to the fiasco surrounding his network this week with a jab President Donald Trump s way, asserting it s the White House chief who s the aggressor in this tiff   that the news organization is the victim.Zucker s like the playground bully, caught mid-punch, mid-push, now standing before the principal, trying to weasel out of blame.  My job is to remind everyone that they need to stay focused doing their job,  Zuckersaid to The New York Times.  [Trump s] trying to bully us, and we re not going to let him intimidate us. You can t lose your confidence and let that change the way you conduct yourselves. Decoded meaning: CNN s not going to change their witch-hunting ways.The whole tiff is over a video clip that Trump retweeted showing him wrestling CNN to the ground. The media, as the media is wont to do, went overboard with the criticism of Trump s retweet, pretending like he was calling for arms against members of the media.CNN then went on a hunt to identify the creator of this video, watchdogging like it s not watchdogged in years. And once identified, the guy was then issued this rather cold, calculating message from CNN: Behave, or we ll name you publicly.Watch Infowars  hilarious  FAKE NEWS  video that replaces the Hitler character with CNN president Jeff Zucker: Hitler reacts to CNN pic.twitter.com/zyjdJTknAN  Trump in 2020 (@GOPin2020) July 8, 2017The hashtag #CNNBlackmail quickly gathered steam on Twitter.

GLOBALIST COMMIE BILL DE BLASIO Abandons NYC for G20 Protests…Will Phony de Blasio aka Warren Wilhelm Jr. Get in Touch with his German Roots?,"Communist Mayor Bill de Blasio just can t help himself. He had to abandon NYC to go to Hamburg, Germany where his anarchist commie buddies are making a fuss it is what globalist commies do. The problem is that New York City is a mess but globalists like de Blasio don t have time for governing when global policy is in jeopardy The New York Post reported:Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday skipped an NYPD swearing-in ceremony made somber by this week s assassination of a cop   then hours later revealed he was busy preparing to jet off on a surprise trip to join leftist protesters at the G-20 summit in Germany.Hizzoner s overseas jaunt was kept under wraps until just 90 minutes before he took off from Newark Airport. A last-minute announcement said he  will attend several events surrounding the G-20 Summit, including Saturday s Hamburg Zeigt Haltung [Hamburg Shows Attitude] rally. De Blasio will be keynote speaker for the loony anti-capitalists. No word on whether he will throw the ceremonial first brick through a bank window.Meanwhile, the NYPD reels from Miosotis Familia s assassination, the subway system rapidly disintegrates, and NYC in general continues to go to the dogs with trash strewn on streets At least de Blasio, who was born Warren Wilhelm Jr., can get in touch with his German roots.Funny irony WARREN WILHELM, JR OR BILL DE BLASIO? We know that his early political career was Marxist, and not just in an academic sense. He raised money for the Sandinistas, visited Nicaragua to align himself with the tyrants, and worked to undermine the efforts of the Reagan administration. No wonder he was endorsed by George Soros. Curiously, he decided to cover up his radical past: There is no mention of his extremist associations on his website. Quite frankly, Bill de Blasio has a problem with the truth. He was born Warren Wilhelm, Jr. in 1961. When he graduated from New York University in 1983 (where he was heavily involved in leftist causes), he changed his name to Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm. In 2002, he changed his name again, settling on Bill de Blasio. The only reason we know this is because the media put the spotlight on him, forcing the issue.De Blasio s character was impugned again when it was learned that he accepted over $50,000 from a group of slumlords. What made this so outrageous was de Blasio s past denunciations of these same men while serving as public advocate.Just recently, when The New York Times confronted de Blasio about his love for  democratic socialism,  expressed in 1990, he said,  That s not a quote from me; that s someone s notes.  But in fact those were his words. When the Times told him it has the proof, he brazenly said,  It doesn t matter.

WOW! LOU DOBBS BLASTS #FakePresident OBAMA: “Spent 8 Years Undermining Core American Values”… Now Doing His Best To “Undercut President Trump” By Pretending To Still Be President [VIDEO],"Lou Dobbs went off on #FakePresident Barack Obama during his  Dobb s Commentary  segment. Fox News host Lou Dobbs is furious that the FORMER President, Barack Obama, aka Barry Soetoro has been either following President Trump around the world to meet with world leaders or meeting with world leaders just prior to scheduled meetings with President Trump.Dobbs suggested to his viewers that Obama s meetings with various world leaders appear to all be organized. Why is the media ignoring Barack Obama s bizarre meetings with South Korea s new President Moon Jae-in, Britian s Prime Minister Theresa May, Canada s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Angela Merkel? Would they have ignored former President George W. Bush if he embarked on a world tour to undercut or undermine Barack Obama only months after he was elected as our President?Perhaps someone needs to tell the FORMER President that in America, there s only ONE President at a time. Barry had his chance, and he failed miserably. It s time for him to step aside and let Donald Trump clean up the mess.

#VeryFakeNews CNN Underestimated Their Opponent: New Report Shows CNN Takes MASSIVE Nosedive In Ratings,"CNN is finally seeing the serious repercussions of reporting #VeryFakeNews, while Fox News remains number one in ratings.CNN s ratings are plummeting, according to a Thursday cable TV rankings report by TV Newser.CNN fell to 10th in average total day viewership among all basic cable networks in the week of June 26 to July 2, far behind first-place Fox News and third-place MSNBC.An average of 639,000 viewers tuned in to CNN per day during the measurement period, less than half of the average 1,390,000 viewers who tuned in to Fox News per day during the same period.CNN s ratings slump is a remarkable drop from just a month ago, when CNN sat in fifth place among all basic cable networks the week of May 29 to June 4.CNN lost an average of 159,000 viewers per day from the week of May 29 to the week of June 26.Fox News and CNN continue to climb in ratings as CNN tumbles.Fox remained number one in all of basic cable, gaining an average of 7,000 viewers per day from the week of May 29 to the week of June 26.The Thursday ratings report is a slap in the face to CNN, which claimed on June 27 its  most-watched second quarter in history. CNN s rating slump occurred in the same week three CNN staffers resigned following a damaging retraction of a story that falsely linked a Trump transition official to the chief executive of a $10 billion Russian investment fund.The network was also hit with a number of undercover videos published by undercover journalist James O Keefe, one of which revealed a CNN health producer dismissing the Trump-Russia collusion narrative and another that revealed CNN contributor Van Jones labeling the Russia story a  nothing burger. Unfortunately for CNN, the ratings report released Thursday does not take into account the latest controversy to hit the network, indicating that its ratings could possibly plummet even further in the coming weeks.CNN came under fire Tuesday for apparently threatening to expose the identity of a private citizen who initially claimed credit for creating a GIF President Trump tweeted showing Trump tackling CNN.#CNNBlackmail trended worldwide Tuesday after the network made public its decision to mask the identity of the private citizen on the condition that the man no longer engages in what CNN considers to be  ugly behavior. Trump has continued to hammer CNN for being the standard-bearer of what he considers  fake news.

RADICAL NYC MAYOR Skips NYPD Swearing In Ceremony To Join Violent G-20 Protesters In Germany…GOP Mayoral Candidate Slams Him On Social Media,"Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday skipped an NYPD swearing-in ceremony made somber by this week s assassination of a cop   then hours later revealed he was busy preparing to jet off on a surprise trip to join leftist protesters at the G-20 summit in Germany.Hizzoner s overseas jaunt was kept under wraps until just 90 minutes before he took off from Newark Airport. A last-minute announcement said he  will attend several events surrounding the G-20 Summit, including Saturday s Hamburg Zeigt Haltung rally. De Blasio will be the keynote speaker, organizers of the demonstration   Hamburg Shows Attitude   tweeted. The mayor also made sure the free trip will include a visit with his son, Dante, a Yale University student who s spending the summer on an internship in Berlin, a City Hall spokesman said.Presumptive Republican challenger Nicole Malliotakis accused de Blasio of abandoning pressing issues in the Big Apple to pursue his progressive agenda in Europe. Unbelievable. Instead of jet-setting around the world, he should be here doing his job,  said the Staten Island assemblywoman.  A police officer was murdered, street homelessness has skyrocketed and people continue to get delayed on the trains. Malliotakis   who later tweeted a doctored image showing de Blasio in an Alpine hat and lederhosen, grinning behind a plate of bratwurst, wienerschnitzel and Pilsner glasses   also blasted him for blowing off the NYPD ceremony at the Police Academy in Queens.Malliotakis jabs de Blasio with Photoshopped tweet over Germany trip https://t.co/DtTRaAQBXD via @nypmetro  carl campanile (@ccampy) July 7, 2017 The mayor should be embarrassed by the way he has treated the men and women of our police department,  she said.He is off gallivanting & I'm here pointing out problems w/ garbage collection, the most basic of city services  https://t.co/yW4MZ02u3O  Nicole Malliotakis (@NMalliotakis) July 7, 2017New Jersey Transit tweeted about a schedule change after a train was derailed yesterday while entering Penn Station in NYC, causing delays in transit for commuters:All Midtown DIRECT trains are being diverted into Hoboken Terminal. NJT is cross-honoring w/ PATH, & NJ TRANSIT & Private bus carriers.  NJ TRANSIT (@NJTRANSIT) July 7, 2017GOP Mayoral candidate Nicole Malliotakis retweeted NJ Transit s message to keep New Yorker s apprised of the change, in the absence of the protesting NYC Mayor DeBlasio:I'm retweeting this to keep #NYC residents informed since our mayor is in Germany where it is 4:57a.m. https://t.co/qV1nXSGHHM  Nicole Malliotakis (@NMalliotakis) July 7, 2017I m so old, I remember when mayors stayed in their city to do their job rather than try to make themselves ideological symbols. https://t.co/deDbXzWU3g  John Avlon (@JohnAvlon) July 7, 2017The head of the NYPD sergeants union also attacked de Blasio. As the city mourns, its leader flees,  Ed Mullins said.  And then he wonders why he has a problem with the police. A real leader stays with the city in this time of hardship.

"REPORT: ANTI-TRUMP, Open-Borders Clooney’s No Longer Feel Secure In England…Moving Back To U.S","Actor and immigration activist George Clooney will move to Los Angeles with his wife Amal and newborn twins Ella and Alexander due to security concerns at his England estate, according to a report.Life & Style magazine reported last week that the 56-year-old Oscar-winner will move his newly-expanded family to his mansion in Studio City, California, after deeming his 17th century mansion in Sonning, England to be not sufficiently safe for them. As soon as Amal found out she was pregnant, he hired former Secret Service agents to assess all his properties and make recommendations for improvement,  an unnamed Clooney  insider  told the magazine.  His mansion in Studio City [Calif.] was deemed the most secure, and it s within minutes of an LAPD station. He doesn t feel like Amal and the twins are safe living in the English countryside,  the source told Life & Style.  He s determined to move his family to LA, where he feels much more secure. The report comes as England has been rocked by terrorist attacks in recent months, including the terrorist bombing of a concert by pop singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in June that claimed the lives of 22 people, many of them young children.In May, British government officials disclosed that 23,000 known jihadi terrorists are believed to be residing in Britain, far more than the 3,000 that had initially been reported.The move for the Clooneys comes as both George and Amal have been among the most vocal and active celebrity advocates for open borders and the free flow of refugees between countries.In February of last year, the actor met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and praised the German leader s acceptance of refugees from Syria and other countries. The same month, Clooney told Sky News in an interview that the United States is not doing  enough  to help Syrian refugees, and that 10,000 refugees per year was too low a figure to be admitting into the country.In an April 2016 interview with the BBC, Amal Clooney criticized then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s plans to build a security wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, telling the outlet that the plan does not represent  U.S. values. George has also been an outspoken critic of Trump, telling The Guardian in a March 2016 interview that he believes Trump to be a  xenophobic fascist  and an  opportunist.  He previously described Trump s immigration policy proposals as  idiotic  and  intolerant.   Breitbart In July, 2016, it was reported that the Clooney s were considering moving from their mansion in Italy after a massive makeshift refugee camp was established in Lake Como, the popular and secluded celebrity hideaway where Hollywood A-lister George Clooney keeps a home.The migration of hundreds of people from Arab nations, Africa, and Asia was triggered following the Swiss government s decision to close its southern border with Italy.Now, waiting for smugglers to lead them into northern Europe, groups of migrants are camping out in tattered tents around the Lake Como resort.Flimsy dwellings, clothes and trash are scattered around the Northern Italian town s railway station, where dozens of new families and refugees have flocked.The migrant camp is, oddly enough, just steps away from the front door of immigration activists  George and Amal Clooney s multi-million dollar lakeside mansion in Lake Como, according to the Daily Mail.The power couple has spent some time talking about the migrant crisis. The Clooneys met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February and praised and thanked her for her leadership during the crisis.The Clooneys have taken refuge from the Hollywood spotlight in their summer home in Italy for years. Last year, Page Six reported that Clooney was mulling putting his Lake Como villa on the market due to ever-present and intrusive paparazzi.It is unclear if the recent deluge of refugees pouring into town will have an affect on Clooney s decision to sell or not.

TUCKER CARLSON Asks How Hypocrite Maxine Waters Affords $4.3 MILLION Mansion After 40 Yrs In Congress,"Maxine Waters is so filled with hate for anyone who disagrees with her, that she s decided to appoint herself as the Democrat s chief attack dog for President Trump and his administration. Unfortunately for Maxine, making a public spectacle of herself also comes with a price. Speaking of a price how about the price tag on career politician Maxine Waters $4.3 million mansion?Tucker Carlson reacted to Rep. Maxine Waters  (D-Calif.) threat to  take [HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson s] a** apart  by noting she might indeed be qualified to take his job.Carlson said Waters, a 40-year politician, lives in a 6,000 square-foot mansion worth $4.3 million that is not in her congressional district.He asked how Waters could afford a home like that in a ritzy neighborhood while solely working as a representative of the 43rd District. We should take her seriously on this subject,  Carlson said, calling her a  confirmed expert on the question on housing. He said that while Waters sometimes speaks using racially-charged rhetoric, she lives in a neighborhood that is only six percent African-American.Via: Fox News",politics,"Jul 6, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Even worse, in some cases, the memes are resurrecting news stories that CNN would rather not see repeated on social media, like the the story about former CNN guest host Kathy Griffin s not-funny photos of herself holding an ISIS inspired, decapitated, bloody head of President Donald Trump. CNN fired Kathy Griffin, but not before they defended her on their network, which quickly earned them the trending hashtag #CNNisISIS on Twitter.Earlier today, we reported on a video that has just been released where CNN s logo is replacing the head of President Trump who s being assassinated in a Central Park  Julius Caesar  play.LOL!

TRUMP EXPOSES OBAMA’S INCOMPETENCE: Cuts EPA Budget…Still Fixes Flint’s Water Crisis,"Although Obama had 3 years to take action to fix the Flint water problem, President Donald Trump has managed to do it in 2 months. The EPA has just issued a $100 million grant to the city of Flint, Michigan to replace the city s corroded and lead-polluted pipes.Critics of President Trump have lambasted him for his proposed budget cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency, saying the cuts are proof that he doesn t care about the environment.EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt released a statement saying,  The people of Flint and all Americans deserve a more responsive federal government  EPA will especially focus on helping Michigan improve Flint s water infrastructure as part of our larger goal of improving America s water infrastructure. Under authority granted the agency by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016, the EPA just issued a $100 million grant to the beleaguered city of Flint, Michigan, to help in the effort at replacing the city s badly corroded and lead-tainted system of water pipes. We are excited and very grateful to receive these much-needed funds,  Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said.  The City of Flint being awarded a grant of this magnitude in such a critical time of need will be a huge benefit. The state of Michigan also contributed $20 million to match 20 percent of the grant. Meanwhile, CNN continues with their anti-Trump narrative and insists that President Trump had nothing to do with the grant and that it actually came from an action that former President Barack Obama and the prior Congress took in 2016. They are clearly blind to Trump s promise to fix the crumbling infrastructure of our country as soon as possible, something Obama never made a priority.CNN also obsessed over Trump s proposed 31 percent EPA budget cuts, failing to mention that the president had no intention of defunding programs to help improve the water system infrastructure.Despite the fact that Flint has been dealing with contaminated water for three years, Obama s EPA did not attempt to fix the problem. Now that Trump is in office, he is taking real action to make positive changes in the lives of Flint, MI citizens.Source: Conservative Tribune",politics,"Jul 6, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

BREAKING: Another Undercover Video Released of CNN Producer Mocking Cuomo and Calling voters “Stupid as Sh*t” [Video],"Project Veritas just released yet another video of the CNN producer calling voters  stupid as sh*t  and even mocking on of their top news anchors  Chris Cuomo!The undercover reporter stroked Carr s ego saying he had just as much  gravitas  as Cuomo and he responded saying,  Just can t stand the guy when he talks, we re like shut up. The Veritas reporter asked for clarification as to who he was talking about and he reaffirmed that he was referring to Cuomo.Carr backed up his past comments on other videos such as calling the American electorate  stupid as sh-t,  and admitting to pushing stories on Russia strictly for ratings. I mean granted, anything I ve said to you I would defend on the record. I don t think I ve said anything, wrong,  said Carr.OUR PREVIOUS VIDEOS AND REPORTS FROM PROJECT VERITAS ON CNN:Project Veritas  newest video from the American Pravda: CNN series exposes Jimmy Carr, the Associate Producer for CNN s New Day attacking President Donald Trump and admitting that CNN has a left-leaning bias. When asked by an undercover journalist if CNN is impartial, Carr plainly responded,  In theory. We reported on the previous videos from Project Veritas: James O Keefe s Project Veritas reporters went undercover at CNN to investigate the #VeryFakeNews network to determine the motivation behind CNN s Trump-Russia collusion obsession. Since the inauguration, CNN has mentioned  Russian story  nearly 16,000 times.Project Veritas  reporters can be seen in the video below having a conversation with CNN s supervising producer John Bonifield. The reporter talked to Bonifield first about the constant barrage of Trump-Russia stories on CNN. Bonifield admitted that although CNN has no evidence or proof of Trump involvement with Russia, they continue to make it their top story on CNN simply for  ratings  and to  make money.  Bonifield has worked as a journalist and as a producer for nearly 15 years at CNN, making him a pretty reliable source when it comes to how things work at CNN.Bonifield actually confessed to the undercover Project Veritas journalist that President Trump is correct when he says the media is on a  witch hunt  to take him down. Bonifield told the reporter:  I think the President is right to say, like, look you are  witch hunting me  You have no real smoking gun, you have no proof. Bonifield told the undercover reporter for Project Veritas that CNN is biased and is playing to their audience by attacking President Trump, and actually admitted that  Trump is good for business right now.  The Project Veritas reporter asked Bonifield,  But honestly, you think the whole Russia shit is bullshit?  to which Bonifield replied:  Could be bullshit. I mean, it s mostly bullshit right now. Like, we don t have any big, giant proof. The way these leaks happen, they d leak it. It d leak. If it was something really good, it would leak. Watch the unbelievable video here:Did the three resignations that took place at CNN today have anything to do with the impending release of O Keefe s explosive video proving that CNN manufactures Trump-Russia collusion stories for ratings, or for money?The story about the three CNN employees resigning for publishing fake news broke yesterday. Is ti a coincidence that today, O Keefe released this explosive bombshell video?Here s the story that broke yesterday: CNN employees have resigned for their role in pushing fake news about the Trump-Russia story that claimed a member of the Trump transition team was under investigation.Reporter Thomas Frank, editor Eric Lichtblau and executive editor Lex Haris all resigned from their positions following a company-wide investigation into the single-sourced story that was quickly debunked, The Washington Post first reported. CNN quickly followed up with a story of their own on the resignations. Lichtblau reportedly oversaw the false story, while Haris headed up CNN s investigative unit. In the aftermath of the retraction of a story published on CNN.com, CNN has accepted the resignations of the employees involved in the story s publication,  CNN s coverage quotes a company spokesman as saying.Philly.com   On Thursday evening, CNN investigative reporter Thomas Frank published a potentially explosive report involving an investigation of a Russian investment fund with potential ties to several associates of President Donald Trump.But by Friday night, the story was removed from CNN s website and all links were scrubbed from the network s social media accounts. That story did not meet CNN s editorial standards and has been retracted,  CNN said in an editors note posted in place of the story.  Links to the story have been disabled.

"WHY ISN’T MEDIA ASKING IF NYPD Cop-Killer and Hillary Supporter Was Influenced By Democrat Leaders, Black Lives Matter Anti-Cop Rhetoric?","An NYPD officer was assassinated early Wednesday by an ex-con who marched up to her NYPD vehicle and pumped a bullet into the helpless cop s head, authorities said.Officer Miosotis Familia, 48, was mortally wounded by the 12:30 a.m. gunshot on a Bronx street as she neared the end of her Fourth of July shift, cops said.Cop-killer Alexander Bonds, dressed in black from head to toe, was then shot to death in a gunfight with two cops responding to a desperate call for help from Familia s partner. Shots fired!  the officer screamed moments after the gunshot.  I need a f ing bus! 10-85 10-85! My partner s shot! My partner s shot! My partner s shot! Hurry up central! Police Commissioner James O Neill said there was no doubt the paroled gunman targeted the 12-year NYPD veteran for execution at E. 183rd St. and Creston Ave.   NY Daily NewsSo why is the same media who blames President Trump for violence committed against Republicans not asking if cop-killer Alexander Bonds was inspired by Barack Obama, Eric Holder, Al Sharpton, Black Lives Matter and Hillary Clinton?Only two years ago, Black Lives Matter supporters were filmed chanting  Pigs in a blanket, fry  em like bacon!  at the MN State Fair. President Barack Obama and his radical AG were silent.""Pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon"" #BlackFair #BlackLivesMatter #FTP #ACAB pic.twitter.com/NaQNehnd5g  EMP THY (@MrNikoG) August 29, 2015President Barack Obama actually lectured mourners on bigotry, slavery and oppression at the memorial service for slain police officers who were killed by a Black Lives Matter supporter. Instead of using the opportunity to condemn the growing, violent movement, he actually appeared to be condoning it. While paying tribute to the fallen officers for sacrificing their lives to protect others from a sniper, Mr. Obama also called on law enforcement agencies to root out bigotry. We have all seen this bigotry in our lives at some point,  Mr. Obama told an audience of several hundred at a concert hall in Dallas. None of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune. And that includes our police departments. We know this.  The officers   Michael Smith, Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Brent Thompson and Patrick Zamarripa were killed by a black sniper who told police he targeted white officers during a Black Lives Matter protest.The day after the memorial service for the Dallas cops who were murdered by a Black Lives Matter supporter, President Barack Obama invited BLM leaders to the White House for a private meeting:It should come as no surprise to anyone that the most recent assassination of an innocent cop was at the hands of Hillary Clinton supporter Alexander Bonds, given her outreach to the Black Lives Matter terror group during her campaign. Wikileaks even released an email showing how radical group Center For American Progress was advising her on how to fake empathy for parents of kids killed by cops.

#FakeNewsMorningShow GMA Compares President Trump To N. Korean’s Murderous Dictator Kim Jong Un [VIDEO],"Beyond the pale ABC reporter Matthew Dowd compared President Donald Trump with N. Korea s Kim Jong Un on Good Morning America Wednesday when having discussion with former Clinton White House communications director Anchor George Stephanopoulos.As for the objectivity and credibility of Clinton Foundation mega-donor George Stephanopoulos, prior to the 2016 presidential election, his wife, Ali Wentworth, claimed the couple would leave the country should Donald Trump become president of the United States. Of course they didn t leave the country. George Stephanopoulos chose instead, to remain in the US as a prominent voice on TV railing against our sitting President.The comments came following a report about N. Korea s intercontinental ballistic missile test and a discussion on the upcoming G20 summit where Trump will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Well, George, I think there s real tension,  Dowd replied.  You take Vladimir Putin on one, but there s real tension with a lot of members of the G20. If you look at the recent polling in the international community, Donald Trump is not believed by most of the people in the European community to be trusted to do the right thing, and you take with that with Vladimir Putin, and now with what s happened in North Korea. The European community is worried about unpredictable erratic leaders, not only one in North Korea but one in the United States of America.   MRCTVWatch:George Stephanopoulos has been initiating attacks on Donald Trump since he became a serious contender in the presidential race. The video below shows a heated exchange between George Stephanopoulos and President Trump s former Senior Campaign Advisor Kellyanne Conway only one month after Trump crushed Hillary in the election. (Notice how ABC starts out the interview between Stephanopoulos and Conway by flashing a screen shot of Hillary s popular vote numbers compared to Trump s when they have nothing to do with the context of the conversation. This is called subliminal messaging, proving the mainstream media has mastered the art of manipulation.)

AWESOME! The donation will restore an historic house on the battlefield, and will help replace fencing. As both the Secretary of the Interior and a military veteran, I m deeply honored and humbled to deliver the donation to Antietam National Battlefield on behalf of President Trump,  Mr. Zinke said.  The president s donation will allow generations of Americans to learn about our history and heritage on this sacred site. Mr. Trump promised to forgo his salary as president, saying he would instead donate it to the federal government.

"WAS KILLER OF FEMALE NYPD Officer, HILLARY Supporter Inspired By Democrat Leaders, Black Lives Matter Anti-Cop Rhetoric?","An NYPD officer was assassinated early Wednesday by an ex-con who marched up to her NYPD vehicle and pumped a bullet into the helpless cop s head, authorities said.Officer Miosotis Familia, 48, was mortally wounded by the 12:30 a.m. gunshot on a Bronx street as she neared the end of her Fourth of July shift, cops said.Cop-killer Alexander Bonds, dressed in black from head to toe, was then shot to death in a gunfight with two cops responding to a desperate call for help from Familia s partner. Shots fired!  the officer screamed moments after the gunshot.  I need a f ing bus! 10-85 10-85! My partner s shot! My partner s shot! My partner s shot! Hurry up central! Police Commissioner James O Neill said there was no doubt the paroled gunman targeted the 12-year NYPD veteran for execution at E. 183rd St. and Creston Ave.   NY Daily NewsSo why is the same media who blames President Trump for violence committed against Republicans not asking if cop-killer Alexander Bonds was inspired by Barack Obama, Eric Holder, Al Sharpton, Black Lives Matter and Hillary Clinton, who made her support for the cop-hating movement a focal-point of her campaign for president?Only two years ago, Black Lives Matter supporters were filmed chanting  Pigs in a blanket, fry  em like bacon! at the MN State Fair.

Instead of using the opportunity to condemn the growing, violent movement, he actually appeared to be condoning it. While paying tribute to the fallen officers for sacrificing their lives to protect others from a sniper, Mr. Obama also called on law enforcement agencies to root out bigotry. We have all seen this bigotry in our lives at some point,  Mr. Obama told an audience of several hundred at a concert hall in Dallas. None of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune. And that includes our police departments. We know this.  The officers   Michael Smith, Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Brent Thompson and Patrick Zamarripa were killed by a black sniper who told police he targeted white officers during a Black Lives Matter protest.The day after the memorial service for the Dallas cops who were murdered by a Black Lives Matter supporter, President Barack Obama invited BLM leaders to the White House for a private meeting:It should come as no surprise to anyone that the most recent assassination of an innocent cop was at the hands of Hillary Clinton supporter Alexander Bonds, given her outreach to the Black Lives Matter terror group during her campaign.

NEW REPORT: OBAMAPHONE Program Stashed $9 BILLION In Private Bank Accounts…Exposes Massive Windfall For Phone Companies,"Who could forget the  Obamaphone Lady  from Cleveland, OH, who unashamedly told an interviewer she was voting for Obama because all minorities in Cleveland get a free Obamaphone from Obama, and  He s gonna do more!  She actually woke up and admitted that she, and other minorities had been played by Obama in a follow-up video at the bottom of the page.The controversial  Obamaphone  program, which pays for cellphones for the poor, is rife with fraud, according to a new government report released Thursday that found more than a third of enrollees may not even be qualified.Known officially as the Lifeline Program, the phone giveaway became a symbol of government waste in the previous administration. Now a new report from the Government Accountability Office bears out those concerns.The report, requested by Sen. Claire McCaskill, Missouri Democrat, also says the program has stashed some $9 billion in assets in private bank accounts rather than with the federal treasury, further increasing risks and depriving taxpayers of the full benefit of that money. A complete lack of oversight is causing this program to fail the American taxpayer   everything that could go wrong is going wrong,  said Mrs. McCaskill, ranking Democrat on the Senate s chief oversight committee and who is a former state auditor in Missouri. We re currently letting phone companies cash a government check every month with little more than the honor system to hold them accountable, and that simply can t continue,  she said. The program, run by the Federal Communications Commission, predates President Obama, but it gained attention during his administration when recipients began to associate the free phone with other benefits he doled out to the poor.   Washington TimesThe Daily Caller reported:A massive portion of Obamaphone recipients are receiving the benefit after lying on their applications, according to a new 90-page report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).An undercover sting operation showed ineligible applications were approved 63 percent of the time, and a review that found that 36 to 65 percent of beneficiaries in various categories had lied in easily-detectable ways but were approved anyway.The fraud reached unheard-of proportions because the Federal Communications Commission let the task of screening for eligibility fall to phone companies that profit off of enrolling as many people as possible.GAO undercover investigators applied for free government phones 19 times using criteria that should have been rejected, and  we were approved to receive Lifeline services by 12 of the 19 Lifeline providers using fictitious eligibility documentation. All someone has to do to apply for free cell phone service is say that they are on another welfare program, such as food stamps or disability, known as SSI.When Congress considered reforms, phone companies took out daily full-page ads in publications read by Capitol Hill staffers. The wife of the CEO of TracFone, the largest beneficiary of Obamaphones, was a mega-fundraiser for former President Barack Obama.The cause of the fraud rates, shocking even by federal government standards, was always clear: The FCC allowed companies with a profit motive to sign up as many people as possible to determine eligibility.Phone companies swooped into housing projects in vans with neon flashing lights to register users. A woman approached by one such representative outside of a welfare office told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group the man encouraged her to enroll her two-year-old.The companies weren t checking eligibility, and the FCC wasn t ensuring they did or punishing those who didn t. Additionally, the FCC failed to provide many companies with the intra-government databases that would give them the ability to perform some checks, the GAO found.The Obamaphone Lady aka Michelle Dowry made an appearance on Alex Jones  show where she admitted to finally waking up, as she discovered that Barack Obama s presidency was a giant hoax. The only thing that Michele and the rest of the the minority community Obama promised to help got during his 8 years in office was a tax-payer funded  free  phone:",politics,"Jul 5, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Huckabee gave a hilarious example of why he believes his daughter is able to handle the leftist media so well: I think my daughter is handling this very well because she has three preschoolers at home. So she s used to dealing with petulant children who ask the same question over and over hoping to get a different answer, the one that they want. And so maybe that s part of the reason she s able to stay flat-footed, look those folks in the eye and handle it.

FILMMAKER DINESH D’SOUZA: Eight Things I LOVE About America!,"FILMMAKER DINESH D SOUZA S Eight things I LOVE about America!  To make us love our country,  Edmund Burke once said,  our country ought to be lovely.  Burke s point is that we should love our country not just because it is ours, but also because it is good. America is far from perfect, and there is lots of room for improvement. In spite of its flaws, however, American life as it is lived today is the best life that our world has to offer. Ultimately America is worthy of our love and sacrifice because, more than any other society, it makes possible the good life, and the life that is good.  America provides an amazingly good life for the ordinary guy  Rich people live well everywhere. But what distinguishes America is that it provides an impressively high standard of living for the  common man. America offers more opportunity and social mobility than any other country, including the countries of Europe  America is the only country that has created a population of  self-made tycoons.  Only in America could Pierre Omidyar, whose parents are Iranian and who grew up in Paris, have started a company like eBay. Work and trade are respectable in America  Historically most cultures have despised the merchant and the laborer, regarding the former as vile and corrupt and the latter as degraded and vulgar. Examples: ancient Greece and medieval Islam But the American founders altered this moral hierarchy. America has achieved greater social equality than any other society  True, there are large inequalities of income and wealth in America. These gaps in material wealth exist on every inch of the globe. But Americans are socially more equal than any other people, and this is unaffected by economic disparities. Alexis de Tocqueville noticed this egalitarianism a century and a half ago and it is, if anything, more prevalent today. For all his riches, Bill Gates could not approach the typical American and say,  Here s a $100 bill. I ll give it to you if you kiss my feet.  Most likely, the person would tell Gates where to go! The American view is that the rich guy may have more money, but he isn t in any fundamental sense better than anyone else. In America the destiny of the young is not given to them, but created by them  In most countries in the world, your fate and your identity are handed to you; in America, you determine them for yourself. America is a country where your life is like a blank sheet of paper, and you are the artist. This notion of being the architect of your own destiny is the incredibly powerful idea that is behind the worldwide appeal of America. America has gone further than any other society in establishing equality of rights  Sadly, there is nothing distinctively American about slavery or bigotry. Slavery has existed in virtually every culture, and xenophobia, prejudice and discrimination are worldwide phenomena. Western civilization is the only civilization to mount a principled campaign against slavery; no country expended more treasure and blood to get rid of slavery than the United States. While racism remains a problem, this country has made strenuous efforts to eradicate discrimination, even to the extent of enacting policies that give legal preference in university admissions, jobs, and government contracts. It is extremely unlikely that a racist society would have permitted such policies in the first place. America has found a solution to the problem of religious and ethnic conflict that continues to divide and terrorize much of the world  Visitors to places like New York are amazed to see the way in which Serbs and Croatians, Sikhs and Hindus, Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants, Jews and Palestinians, all seem to work and live together in harmony. How is this possible when these same groups are spearing each other and burning each other s homes in so many places in the world? The American answer is, do not extend rights to racial or ethnic groups but only to individuals; in this way, all are equal in the eyes of the law, opportunity is open to anyone who can take advantage of it, and everybody who embraces the American way of life can truly  become American. America has the kindest, gentlest foreign policy of any great power in world history  Critics of the United States are likely to react to this truth with sputtering outrage. Quoting a laundry list of American sins. What the critics leave out is the other side of the story. Twice in the 20th century, the United States saved the world   first from the Nazi threat, then from Soviet totalitarianism. What would have been the world s fate if America had not existed? After destroying Germany and Japan in World War II, the United States proceeded to rebuild both countries, and today they are American allies. Now we are doing the same thing in Afghanistan and Iraq. For the most part America is an abstaining superpower; it shows no real interest in conquering and subjugating the rest of the world. (Imagine how the Soviets would have acted if they had won the Cold War.) On occasion the United States intervenes to overthrow a tyrannical regime or to halt massive human rights abuses in another country, but it never stays to rule that country. In Grenada, Haiti and Bosnia, the United States got in and then it got out. U.S. troops build hospitals, orphanages and schools across the globe. Almost everyday American planes dropped food and medical supplies to avert hardship and starvation. What other country does these things? What other superpower in history has such moral restraint on its unequaled power? -list by D.

OMINOUS WARNING TO EUROPEANS: You Are Committing Self-Murder…Life As You Know It Is About To Change…Immigrants Will Bring Their Wars To Your Doorstep [VIDEO],"Douglas Murray, author of The Strange Death Of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam gives a stunning account of the  self murder  or Europe in the  Death Of Europe  article published by ExpressUKI have travelled to the places where migrants continue to land and the places where they keep ending up. Everywhere I have gone I have come to the same conclusion: our continent is in the process of self-murder.Amid the day-to-day distraction of life and politics, it is easy to forget this biggest event of our time. All pale into insignificance besides the story of the loss by Europeans of the only place we had to call home.Whenever this country does have a debate about immigration it is minuscule. It tends to focus on Calais. The British public sees footage of people sitting in makeshift tents or hurling missiles into the roads to slow the trucks down so they can board them and break into Britain.Each time actors, celebrities and politicians head to Calais and visit the camp. They return to tell the British public that it must be more open-hearted and generous.The argument they make is humane. It is an understandable reaction to human misery but it is a core part of our society s suicide mission.Take that example of Calais. Before the latest clearance of the camp there were about 6,000 people living there. None of them should have been there.By being there they had already broken every one of the rules that our continent put in place which demands they seek asylum in the first country of arrival. Almost nobody arrives into France first.All these people have landed in Greece or Italy and made their way north.And yet still the celebrities and others pick at our consciences. Can we not be generous and at least let in the people who are there? It is wholly understandable   and also ill-informed madness.Over this year s Easter weekend alone about 8,000 people were picked up between the coast of north Africa and the south of Italy.They were described   as everyone always is   as being  rescued . In fact what happens   what has been happening for years   is that each day boats filled with migrants set out from north Africa.During the heights of the migration crisis of 2015, when Germany s Chancellor Angela Merkel opened up the doors of Europe to the world, the whole continent began to buckle.But in reality that flood of millions into Europe only sped up a process that had been under way for years. Ever since the postwar period European governments had encouraged migrant workers to come in.At first   as Chancellor Merkel herself admitted in a speech in 2010   they expected the workers to return home. But they didn t. They stayed. As did the flow after that and the ones for decades after that.The governments of countries such as ours failed to get anything right. All their predictions were wrong for decades. They were wrong that people would stay for only a short time. Wrong to think that they would not continue to come in large numbers.Wrong that they might not want to bring their extended families to join them. And wrong to think that once the tap was turned on anything but very radical action could ever bring the numbers to a controllable level.During the course of researching The Strange Death Of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam, I have travelled to see the places where those migrants who arrive on our continent end up. Last year the migrant crisis was widely believed to have slowed down.But it had not and its effects were still visible everywhere. In the outskirts of Paris I saw hundreds of young sub-Saharan men living in tents in the middle of roadways. The French police would occasionally move them a few hundred feet further along.In remote parts of Sweden areas that used to be filled with Swedes are inhabited instead by the residents of other continents.Still the dream of some Europeans is that the arrivals into Europe will become European. It is more likely that Europe will simply begin to look increasingly Third World.

SHUT IT DOWN! JUDICIAL WATCH PRES Calls Out Biased Mueller Witch Hunt “Are there any Trump donors on the team?” [Video]," Are there any Trump donors on the team? GREAT QUESTION BY TOM FITTON! Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton joined FOX News to explain Mueller s latest hire of Andrew Goldstein, a former prosecutor who worked under Preet Bharara in New York. Remember Prett Bharara? Trump fired him! Fitton questioned who is overseeing Mueller s day-to-day conduct, pointing to the 12 hires he has made for his legal team all liberal political hacks!Special Counsel Mueller s investigation is out of control. @realDonaldTrump DOJ should shut it down. https://t.co/IYr9Hiqkix  Tom Fitton (@TomFitton) July 2, 2017A VERY KEY REASON FOR THIS WITCH HUNT TO END IS THAT: Several of the lawyers donated to Democrats and it seems that the team is  searching for a crime. Fitton said:  I don t understand what this investigation is about.. You know my count is 14, 15 lawyers to have working on this one investigation to investigate to investigate what? An employment dispute between Comey and the President? You have the conflicts caused by Comey leaking records to get Mueller appointed, you have Constitutional concerns about the way the office operates. Fitton then pointed out what s a big concern for most people watching this unfold:  Are there any Trump donors on the team? IN CASE YOU HAVEN T HEARD   HERE S OUR RECENT REPORT ON THE LOPSIDED GROUP OF ALL DEMOCRAT DONOR LAWYERS HELPING MUELLER TRY AND BURY TRUMP:Former NH Governor John Sununu let Alison Camarata have it when she asked about the Russia investigation and Robert Mueller. Sununu said that Trump should have been notified if he was under investigation and then he slammed Mueller for hiring all Dems.Camerota:  Should the White House know if the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice? Sununu:  If the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice, the White House should have been officially notified. Sununu:  What bothers me the most and there must be a reason for it, is Mueller making four of his first hires so blatantly biased lawyers, pro-Democrat lawyers with a bias certainly against the President. Maybe Mueller has decided internally that this isn t going anywhere and that the only way he can have credibility on a decision saying that there s nothing there is to have that decision come from a group of lawyers that are so blatantly biased against the President. CNN Reports   Three members of the legal team known to have been hired so far by special counsel Robert Mueller to handle the Russia investigation have given political donations almost exclusively to Democrats, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Election Commission records.",politics,"Jul 3, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

BRAINWASHED CHILDREN MOCK President Trump in Disturbing Washington Post VIDEO,"A disturbing video published by The Washington Post on June 29 shows a group of brainwashed students singing Twitter posts by President Donald Trump attempting to mock him. A group of about twelve children, entitled  Washington Post Kids Chorus , are shown in a classroom banging on drums and waving American flags. The video is called  The Washington Post s Kids Chorus Singing President Trump s Tweets . Following their mockery of President Donald Trump, the class sings the Post s new motto:  Democracy Dies in Darkness .The Post does not state the name of the school or location where the mockery took place. The video, which was published on June 29 to the Post s verified YouTube account was also mentioned in the June 30 column, The Daily 202, titled  The Daily 202 presents the world debut of the Washington Post Kids Chorus. Their first musical assignment had a political twist: the president s tweets. From our video team: .Viewers who were disgusted in the Washington Post video made some of the following comments:  How about we leave 5-year-olds out of politics? Anything else is borderline brainwashing. Let the kids decide for themselves what their political beliefs are. No one else believes you so you have to trick children to push your narrative. This is just beyond wrong and twisted. The Left have always used children as political props. They control the schools so they have ready access. This is like North Korean propaganda.

There he attacked Trump s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change accord. In Paris, we came together around the most ambitious agreement in history about climate change, an agreement that even with the temporary absence of American leadership can still give our children a fighting chance,  Obama said in Indonesia.The former president had said before leaving office that he appreciated his predecessor George W. Bush s silence during his tenure, but also contended that he s  still a citizen and that carries with it duties and obligations.

"AWESOME! GREG GUTFELD: World hatred of Trump is their problem, not ours! [Video]","Greg Gutfeld nailed how Americans feel right now about their place in the world.  America First  is the mantra that candidate Trump repeatedly spoke about in rally after rally. The globalists and establishment joined with Democrats to oppose Trump but he s a fearless soldier for America s return to greatness:  From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it s going to be only America First.    DJTIt s way past time to realize that world hatred of Trump is their problem, not ours Thank you Greg Gutfeld!JUST IN CASE YOU NEED A REFRESHER ON WHAT TRUMP PROMISED FOR AMERICAN:A transcript of Donald Trump s inaugural address, delivered Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, after his swearing-in as the 45th president of the United States.Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: Thank you.We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.We will face challenges, we will confront hardships but we will get the job done.Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michele Obama for their gracious aid in this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you.Today s ceremony has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or one party to another but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.For too long a small group in our nation s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories, their triumphs have not been your triumphs.And while they celebrated in our nation s capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.That all changes right here and right now because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you.It belongs to everyone gathered here today, and everyone watching all across America.This is your day, this is your celebration, and this, the United States of America, is your country.What truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people. Jan. 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.The forgotten men and women of this country will be forgotten no longer.Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonably demands of righteous people and a righteous public.But for too many of our citizens a different reality existsMothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge. And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.We are one nation   and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.For many decades, we ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; we ve defended other nation s borders while refusing to defend our own; and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.We ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.From this day forward, it s going to be only America First.Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.I will fight for you with every breath in my body   and I will never, ever let you down.America will start winning again, winning like never before.We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work   rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world   but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example   we will shine   for everyone to follow.We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones   and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.The Bible tells us,  How good and pleasant it is when God s people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.There should be no fear   we are protected, and we will always be protected.We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action   constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.The time for empty talk is over.Now arrives the hour of action.Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the wind-swept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:You will never be ignored again.Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.Together, we will make America strong again.We will make America wealthy again.We will make America proud again.We will make America safe again.And yes, together we will make America great again.

TRUMP DRIVES CRITICS CRAZY: Eliminates Obama’s Czars…Pays Female Staffers More Than Men…Saves Taxpayers Millions!,"Meanwhile, back at CNN Russia Russia Russia!The White House payroll is an excellent example of Trump s commitment to shrink government and save taxpayers money. The White House released the report of Trump s staffers  salaries in a 16-page report on Friday, resulting in projected four-year savings of more than $22 million. Not only is President Trump refusing to take his $400,000 salary, but also eliminating czars (which Obama came under fire for hiring starting in 2009), expensive  fellowships , and spending on FLOTUS staff.Here are some key findings:Some special initiative czars that worked for President Obama include Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change Carol Browner ($172,000), Director of the Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships Joshua DuBois ($98,000), White House Director of Urban Affairs Adolfo Carrion Jr ($158,500), and Director of the White House Office of Health Reform Nancy-Ann DeParle ($158,500).The reports also confirm only 5 staffers dedicated to First Lady Melania Trump, compared to Michelle Obama s outrageous 24 staffers.Trump also eliminated positions in the White House Leadership Development program which was instituted by President Obama in 2015. Positions included that of Elaine Ho at a salary of $158,700 who was in charge of working with the Office of the First Lady to implement her  Let Girls Learn  initiative. Two  Directors  whose positions were also eliminated from the payroll include Pamela Coleman ($120,000) and Katherine Pielemeier ($60,876).Gary Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs and current Director of the White House National Economic Council, and Christopher Liddell, Director of Strategic Initiatives in the White House and a former Microsoft Chief Financial Officer, are serving with reduced salaries of $30,000.President Trump donated his first quarter paycheck to the Dept. of Interior for construction and repair needs in military cemeteries.

“WITH ALL DUE RESPECT”: HHS Sec Tom Price Runs Circles Around NBC’s Chuck Todd [Video],"NBC s Chuck Todd was no match for the astute HHS Sec Tom Price in an interview today on the healthcare bill. Todd tried to get Price to badmouth Trump at the 6:45 point Not gonna happen!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIis3b-tMCUHealth & Human Services Secretary Tom Price joined NBC s Chuck Todd today to discuss healthcare but Todd tried to get Price to bad-mouth the president.Chuck Todd started out being combative on the healthcare bill and then moved on to bashing President Trump.Chuck Todd goes there:  Let me ask you about the tone of the president s tweets. Many Republicans in the Senate condemned the personal attack on Mika Brzezinski and attacking on her looks. You have Lindsey Graham saying it was  beneath the office.  Ben Sasse,  This isn t normal.  Jeff Flake,  Beneath the dignity of the presidency.  Susan Collins begging,  This has to stop.  Lisa Murkowski begging,  This has to stop.  Does his behavior bother you? HHS Sec Tom Price wasn t about to go there and handled the uncomfortable situation beautifully:  Well, what I m concentrated on is the job that he s given me. And that is to make certain that we fulfill the mission of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is to improve the health, safety, and well-being of the American people. And there are a whole array of activities that we re undertaking. One of them is this piece of legislation that s in the Senate right now. But my job is consumed by making certain that we fulfill the mission at the department. Todd follows up with this rude question:  I m just asking you as a father. If your son tweeted about a woman like that, what would you say to him? Price fired back:  Chuck, you know, this is really remarkable. You ve got incredible challenges across this nation, incredible challenges around the world. The challenge that I ve been given is to address the health care issues. And your program, a program with the incredible history of Meet the Press, and that s what you want to talk about? Let me suggest to you that the American people want to talk about the challenges. Chuck Todd then tried to twist and spin his way out of the corner he just painted himself into:  Mr. Secretary, with all due respect, you re blaming me for what the president of the United States has spent his entire week focused on? HAHA! CHUCK TODD STEPS IN IT WITH THAT COMMENT PRICE BURIES HIM WITH THIS LAST COMMENT: No, listen to me, with all due respect. The American people are concerned about a health care system that is not providing choices, where premiums are going up, where insurance companies are vacating markets all across this land. And that s what they want us to concentrate on. And that s what they want us to fix. And that s what I and the president are working on. BOOM!

MEDIA GOES NUTS After Trump Tweets HILARIOUS VIDEO Showing Him Body-Slamming CNN,"President Trump on Sunday tweeted a video of him body-slamming World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon whose face was replaced by the CNN logo.The tweet, which said,  #FraudNewsCNN #FNN,  linked to a video of the president decking, pummeling and then shaving off McMahon s hair during a  Battle of the Billionaires  stunt at WrestleMania XXIII in 2007.#FraudNewsCNN #FNN pic.twitter.com/WYUnHjjUjg  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2017McMahon is the husband of Linda McMahon, who heads Trump s Small Business Administration.President Barack Obama hosted felon and radical organizer Bob Creamer (the guy who was caught on video talking about how he was organizing paid protesters to incite violence at Trump rallies) at the White House over 100 times while he was in office. After the undercover video was released that exposed the Democrats plan to incite violence against innocent Trump supporters, the media was silent. The media was also silent when it was discovered that Obama s Attorney General Eric Holder, used taxpayer funds to pay people to protest against George Zimmerman in the heated Trayvon Martin case, which was the birthplace of the violent Black Lives Matter movement. Those protests marked the first step in Obama s plan to divide America.In a statement on Twitter, CNN recalled comments from White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders last week that the president doesn t condone violence against the media. The President in no way form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence. If anything, quite the contrary.    @SHSanders45 6/29/17,  the CNN tweet said.Bipartisan condemnation against the take-down video continued to build Sunday morning.GOP Rep. Eric Swalwell urged all Republicans to rebuke the Tweet or be complicit in its message. I am calling on EVERY @HouseGOP Member of Congress to condemn this. You were elected to be a check on power. Check it, or you condone it,  the California representative tweeted on Sunday.Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi also blasted the tweet. Violence & violent imagery to bully the press must be rejected. This #July4th, celebrate freedom of the press, guardians to our democracy,  she wrote on Twitter.Paul Joseph Watson sums up the media hypocrisy beautifully with this one tweet:Trump is ""inciting violence"" with a wrestling meme, says same media that literally painted a crosshair target on Trump's head. pic.twitter.com/m8V8XjYHU0  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) July 2, 2017A Trump administration official said he doesn t view Trump s tweet as inciting violence against the media. Certainly not, though I think that no one would perceive that as a threat. I hope they don t. I do think that [Trump is] beaten up in a way on cable platforms that he has a right to respond to,  Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert said on ABC s  This Week. He said cable news shows are  not always very fair to the president,  who developed a social media platform to speak directly to the  American people. Trump is  the most genuine president and the most non-politician president we ve seen in my lifetime,  he said.Watch #FakeNewsCNN  experts  call Trump  Dangerous  and a  Fascist :The president was also the subject of bipartisan scorn last Thursday when he posted the  bleeding badly  tweet about Brzezinski, with many lawmakers saying it was beneath the dignity of the office.Trump defended his use of social media in a tweet on Saturday. My use of social media is not Presidential   it s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again!,  he wrote. NYPNOTE TO CNN: Re-tweeting a video that s been around for years showing a fake body-slam by then businessman Trump is a far cry from promoting violence. If you were so concerned about violence, why didn t you do any stories on felon, husband of a United States Congresswoman and Democrat operative who was caught on tape planning to incite violence at Trump rallies before he even became our President?

THE KING OF “US vs THEM” POLITICS Claims Trump Has Divisive Policies: “Fight against the politics of ‘us and them’ [Video],"Obama urged Indonesians on Saturday to resist divisive politics based on race and religion It was REALLY just another swipe at Trump. He s done this fear mongering over and over before (see video below from 2016) and he s doing it again by taking a veiled swipe at President Trump during his visit to Indonesia: *FYI-He gave the same BS speech on 9/11, 1/13, 6/16, 11/16   ANOTHER FYI   This has been the mantra of the Obamas for years! Check out Monica Crowley s take below. She calls out these political grifters who always PROJECT wrongdoing on others. Aren t THEY the ones who are guilty of the very thing they re claiming someone else is doing?CHECK THIS TOTAL BS OUT: I love that for Barack, there is no such thing as  us  and  them    he doesn t care whether you re a Democrat, a Republican, or none of the above. He knows that we all love our country. And he s always ready to listen to good ideas. He s always looking for the very best in everyone he meets.    Michelle Obama The Guardian reported:The former US president said some countries had adopted  an aggressive kind of nationalism  and  increased resentment of minority groups , in a speech in Indonesia on Saturday that could be seen as a commentary on the US as well as Indonesia.Obama, who was on a personal visit to the country where he spent some of his childhood, said the Muslim community in Indonesia had historically protected Hindu and Buddhist temples. Indonesia is made of thousands of islands, hundreds of languages, scores of regions and ethnic groups. So my time here made me cherish and respect for people s differences,  he told a packed audience in Jakarta.Obama stopped short of mentioning any specific cases of racial or religious intolerance. It is very important here in Indonesia, the United States, Europe, everywhere, to fight against the politics of  us and them ,  he said to cheers from thousands of mostly Indonesians who have worked or studied abroad.He arrived in Jakarta after visiting the cultural city of Yogyakarta and white-water rafting on the tourist island of Bali. He also met Indonesian President Joko Widodo in Bogor, south of the capital.Indonesia, a country of 250 million people, has experienced rising intolerance against non-Muslims and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.A leader of Indonesia s second-largest Muslim organization this week called for a boycott of Starbucks, saying that the international coffee chain s pro-gay stand risks ruining the  religious and cultured  core of the country.MONICA CROWLEY CALLED THE OBAMAS OUT WHEN MICHELLE GAVE A SPEECH REFERRING TO BARACK S  US vs THEM  Mantra:Last night, Michelle Obama took the stage and delivered a speech meant to rally the Democratic faithful and to humanize her husband. After nearly four years of his presidency, it does seem odd that she still has to humanize him. That s usually something that more unknown challengers must do. But the perception of Obama as an aloof, distant, egotistical narcissist has been growing, so Michelle was dispatched to paint a warmer picture of him. If Team Obama is worried about THAT at this late hour as well as worrying about their base they know they re in trouble.For what it was, Michelle s speech was solid, and she certainly knows how to deliver. It was a home run, the same way Ann Romney s speech was a home run last week. But one short paragraph has become the definitive theme of the speech, because it rings so outrageously false. She said,  I love that for Barack, there is no such thing as  us  and  them    he doesn t care whether you re a Democrat, a Republican, or none of the above. He knows that we all love our country. And he s always ready to listen to good ideas. He s always looking for the very best in everyone he meets. The ONLY thing Obama has done since taking office is divide on the basis of  us  vs.  them.  He and his team have divided Americans by class (by incessantly slamming the  1%,   millionaires and billionaires,  commanding them to do their  fair share,  etc).He has divided by race (see Joe Biden s recent comment,  They re gonna put y all back in chains ).He has divided by age (attempting to scare seniors by falsely and dishonestly suggesting that the Republicans  Medicare reforms would toss grandma off the cliff, and by giving away the store to college kids on student loans).And he has divided by gender (ginning up a completely bogus GOP  war on women. )As far as Michelle s comment that Obama  doesn t care whether you re a Democrat, a Republican, or none of the above,  and  he s always ready to listen to good ideas ,  Obama hasn t met with the GOP in over a year, scolded them on Day One of his presidency with  I won,  told a Democrat who had voted against the stimulus,  Don t think we re not keeping score, brother,  and once referred to  punishing our enemies.  Not exactly the warm n  fuzzy Barack Michelle was desperately trying to paint.And as far as  listening to good ideas,  he blew off his own deficit reduction commission, Simpson-Bowles, as well as Paul Ryan s budget reform ideas and disregarded moderate Democrats  ideas to carry out health reform more slowly and with GOP buy-in (see: defeated Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln and her pleas to Obama, which fell on deaf ears).So: Michelle can try all she wants to resurrect Obama s 2004 image of a guy who said  there s not a red America or a blue America,  and she and other Democrats can try to invoke his 2008 image of the transcendent guy sitting above petty politicking and business-as-usual. But after nearly four years of division, distraction, and destruction, not many people are buying that sales pitch anymore. It s old, it s tired, and like his radical redistributionism, it s done.",politics,"Jul 2, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

NUMEROUS PUBLIC Rapes Of Teenage Girls Reported At Swedish Music Festivals: “Rapes at Swedish festivals are not really news anymore”,"Last year, we reported about women who attended an  anti-racism  music festival in Sweden that were raped and molested by migrant men. This report is yet another shocking example of how the west is actually importing a real rape culture.According to police spokesman Stefan Dangardt, numerous  foreign men  sexually assaulted the women during Borl nge s  Peace and Love  festival, although three suspects who were arrested were later released because they claimed they were minors.It appears that nothing has changed since last year. Yesterday, Swedish police received several reports of rape after   music festivals at various locations on Friday evening.A 15-year-old girl was raped during a concert at the Br valla Festival in Norrk ping on Friday night.According to the police, the girl was held and raped by a man in the midst of the crowd in front of the concert goers, without anyone intervening.  It s terrible that one has to experience such a thing with a lot of people around, says police spokesman, Thomas Agnevik, to Aftonbladet.We have little information about the perpetrator and about what has happened, he said, while encouraging those present during the concert to contact the police if they saw anything suspicious.The girl was taken care of and underwent a medical examination.During the City Festival in V ster s, two rapes were reported, one of a 16 year old girl.  We have talked to her and obtained information, but we currently have no suspects, said spokesperson for the police in V stmanland, Thomas Gustafsson.A 26-year-old woman has also reported rape after the festival.  She has been sent to hospital and we have been unable to talk to her. Therefore, I do not have any more details, says Gustafsson.Rapes at Swedish festivals are not really news anymore. It is merely about announcements. We are actually there now.

ERIC HOLDER Encourages DOJ To Keep Attacking Trump…STUNNING List Of Holder Scandals Reveals Why Trump Needs To Drain Obama’s Corrupt DOJ Swamp,"The most corrupt Attorney General in the history of the United States is allegedly thinking of throwing his hat into the ring as a Democrat contender in the 2020 Presidential race. What better way to invigorate crooked Democrats than to call on the very people who had his back at the DOJ to keep attacking President Trump?Former Attorney General Eric Holder spoke in Los Angeles last week to promote a bill that some observers say would make California a  sanctuary state,  an appearance that he says is the start of a new phase of his career in which he plans to reenter the world of politics. Up to now, I have been more behind-the-scenes,  Holder told Yahoo News in a new interview published Tuesday, describing his plans.  But that s about to change. Holder, who served as former President Barack Obama s first attorney general, indicated that his goal is to head the legal resistance to President Donald Trump s agenda. But that may just be the tip of the iceberg.Three sources who have spoken to Holder and are familiar with his thinking told Yahoo that he may consider challenging Trump in 2020 for the White House. Now is the time to be more visible,  Holder said.  Now is the time to be heard. Holder made his voice heard on Twitter yesterday, as he called on the DOJ and FBI to keep up their attacks on President Trump:To the career men & women at DOJ/FBI: your actions and integrity will be unfairly questioned. Be prepared, be strong. Duty. Honor. Country.  Eric Holder (@EricHolder) June 30, 2017Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton whose legal group has helped to expose numerous Holder scandals had this to say about Eric Holder s tweet:Obama's first corrupt AG encourages continued Deep State attacks on @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/9dacBFmdZd  Tom Fitton (@TomFitton) July 1, 2017Eric Holder s scandalsContempt of Congress   On June 28, 2012, Eric Holder became the first and only US Attorney General in American history to be held in Contempt of Congress on both civil and criminal grounds. The US House vote was 255-67, with Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and 16 other Democrats walking out in protest and refusing to vote. President Obama called the action  politically motivated  and cited Executive Privilege for refusing to remove his own Attorney General. It then fell on Eric Holder s own Justice Dept to prosecute him, which it declined to do.Black Power   Eric Holder s earliest scandal dates back to his college days at Columbia. There, he was campus leader of a black power organization and a public supporter of the Black Panther Party. He organized sit-ins at the school demanding that the ROTC office be officially renamed in honor of Malcolm X.Fort Hood cover-up   After the 2009 Fort Hood massacre by US Army Major Nidal Hasan which took 13 lives, the Justice Dept report on the incident refused to mention Hasan s extreme Islamic beliefs and instead ruled the mass shooting a workplace incident, not an act of terror.Spying on Associated Press   The Justice Dept was caught spying on Associated Press by collecting months worth of phone records at the news wire, as well as the home phones of reporters and editors. The telephone records the DoJ secretly investigated included the phones at the AP s offices in Washington DC, New York, Hartford, and even the AP s phone inside the US House of Representatives.Spying on Fox News   The DoJ monitored the personal email and phone of a Fox News reporter, as well as the Fox News phones in New York and Washington. The Justice Dept said the news outlet had temporarily lost its press freedom when its reporter received classified information from a CIA whistleblower.War on Gun Owners   AG Holder has said that his interpretation of the US Constitution is that the Second Amendment guaranteeing the right to keep and bear arms only applies to the Militia. And to him, the Militia is the modern day National Guard and Reserves. Researchers have pointed out that in every instance where state and local authorities have sought the legal advice from the DoJ on proposed gun control laws, the Justice Dept has approved every single one.Protecting Black Power and Voter Intimidation   On Election Day in 2008, the New Black Panther Party had set up at Philadelphia polling places, threatening white voters, hurling racial slurs and stopping white voters from voting. The tactics were caught on video and the assailants were identified. After a national outrage, the DoJ refused to take action on either the hate crimes or the Voting Rights violations.Stimulus Program   Out of President Obama s $800 billion 2009  Stimulus Program , AG Holder was handed $1 billion of the money to be handed out to local law enforcement officials across the country. Most of the stimulus money turned out to be used as kick-backs to Obama campaign contributors, including Eric Holder who himself was a top campaign bundler for the 2008 Obama campaign.Foreigners voting in US Elections   Through his entire tenure, the Attorney General has steadfastly insisted that voters not be required to prove their identity when casting a ballot. The AG publicly touts that his DoJ has challenged two dozen state laws and Governor s executive orders requiring voters to show an official ID before voting.Foreign Terrorists have Rights   The DoJ declared that foreign terrorists captured almost anywhere other than a military battlefield were entitled to the same civil rights as US citizens.Buying the Justice Dept   In his book  Extortion , author Peter Schweizer details how President Obama chose the people who would head his Justice Dept   he sold the positions.  When President Obama established his Justice Department staff after the 2008 election, something unprecedented happened,  Schweizer writes,  For the first time, at least half a dozen senior positions were occupied by individuals who had been campaign bundlers (fund raisers) for a presidential candidate, including not only Attorney General Eric Holder but also senior officials who dealt with criminal and civil prosecutions.  Those high level Justice Dept appointees who are accused of buying their jobs are,  Associate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli, Deputy Associate Attorney General Karol Mason, and Associate Attorney General Tony West. Stealing 1,000,000 American Homes   Immediately after the housing collapse of 2007 and the economic collapse of 2008, America s largest mortgage lenders began criminally foreclosing on hundreds of thousands of American families without cause and using  robo-signing machines . Most didn t even have mortgages, much less with those banks. Sheriff s across the country removed a half million American families at gun point for no legitimate reason, only because banks had fraudulently filed foreclosure papers. The number of victims was so large, the DoJ cut off new claimants in 2012 when the number of properties stolen by six Wall Street banks hit 750,000. Since then, hundreds of thousands more families have been refused any justice or reimbursement at all by AG Holder. And for the 750,000 families the Justice Dept sued the banks for and settled with, the banks were ordered to pay each family an average of $2,000 each   $2,000 as total reimbursement for a $100,000 home criminally stolen, and all the furniture and possessions inside when the bank and police forced the families into the street. The settlement negotiated by the Justice Dept also bars the victims from ever suing the banks to get their money back. The five banks that stole one million American homes and businesses and were protected by AG Holder and the DoJ were Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and Ally Financial.Prosecuting Journalists   When Anonymous hackers leaked documents from Defense Dept contractors showing that the corporation had a program to spy on the American people inside and outside their homes, a number of news outlets covered the story. Three, including the New York Times, The Guardian and ProPublica, along with a handful of freelance journalists, included links to the leaked material online where it was posted by Anonymous for the whole world to see. The DoJ arrested and prosecuted one freelance reporter, charging him with 17 different criminal counts, all because he included the same website link that the other publications published for their readers.Protecting UBS Bank   When the DoJ was forced to sue UBS bank for defrauding its customers, AG Holder had to recuse himself because UBS was his former client when he worked at a Washington law firm.Protecting Illegal Immigrants   In 2010, the Arizona Legislature passed a law giving its State Police the authority to check the immigration status of anyone police suspected of being here illegally. The DoJ sued the state of Arizona to overturn the law, insisting it was the DoJ s privilege to enforce the country s immigration laws, not the states.Jon Corzine and MF Global Connection   Former Democratic New Jersey US Senator Jon Corzine left office to lead the financial firm MF Global, where he stole, pocketed or gambled away $1.6 billion he authorized taking from customers  bank accounts. The bank s law firm at the time was Covington & Burlington. Both AG Holder and Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer were recent employees of that firm. The DoJ chose Associate Attorney General Tony West to prosecute Corzine and MF Global. West came from the firm Morrison & Foerester, which was handling MF Global s assets at the time.DoJ Hiring Discrimination   In 2011, documents were revealed showing that AG Holder and the Justice Dept s Civil Rights Division used political litmus tests to hire employees. After President Obama s election in 2008, Holder publicly announced that the Justice Department was  going to be looking for people who share our values. FBI Assassination Plot of Occupy Wall St leaders   In 2011, two separate FBI offices   Houston and Jacksonville   published internal memos detailing a proposal to identify, photograph and assassinate Occupy Wall Street leaders using snipers. MIT students sued for the details and won. But the DoJ only turned over partial excerpts of 5 of the 17 known FBI documents on the secret project. AG Holder has refused to release the remaining documents or explain the secret assassination program at all.Lying to Congress   In 2011, the DoJ admitted to providing false testimony to Congress in their investigation of the Justice Dept and Fast and Furious.Assassinating American Citizens   With the targeted killing of Americans beginning in 2011, President Obama became the first President to order the death of an American citizen without charge, trial or conviction. He went on to assassinate an American child using the same secret targeted killing program. AG Holder not only publicly approved the President s legal authority, but personally endorsed it.Fast and Furious   In 2012, the US House voted AG Eric Holder in Contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over thousands of documents exposing the true account of the DoJ s secret gun trafficking operation which supplied over 2,000 military weapons to Mexican drug cartels. The gun-running operation began in 2009 and was run out of the Phoenix US Attorney s office along with the BATF.Protecting Mexican Drug Lords   In 2012, national media outlets confirmed that the drug lord and prime target of the DoJ s secret Fast and Furious operation, Manuel Celis-Acosta, was actually taken into custody by the Justice Dept twice during the program. But both times the DoJ released him without charges.Anti-white prosecutions   In 2013, when the violent  knockout game  trend was circulating social media, the DoJ got involved and prosecuted a perpetrator for hate crimes. But while the dozens of videoed attackers were all black and admitted targeting white victims, AG Holder found the only known white perpetrator and charged him instead.Too Big to Jail   In 2013, AG Holder testified before Congress answering America s question of why not a single banker went to jail for the criminal activity that led to the global economic collapse in 2008. He explained that Wall Street financial institutions had become too big and too important. He freely admitted that the Justice Department had its hands tied and couldn t prosecute any of the banks for fear that it would lead to their collapse and that would lead to another global financial crash.Spying on Americans   In 2012, two US Senators warned the American people that they d be horrified if they knew how President Obama and AG Holder were interpreting and executing the Patriot Act. Forbidden by law from telling America themselves, the US Senators called on the AG to declassify the DoJ s interpretation of the counter-terrorism law. AG Holder refused. The ACLU sued and the Supreme Court agreed. The DoJ still refuses.Protecting Senators Reid and Lee   In 2012, the DoJ announced it would not get involved in a criminal investigation of US Senators Harry Reid and Mike Lee. In a multi-state criminal scandal that already forced the Utah Attorney General to resign, local Republican and Democrat District Attorneys asked the DoJ for help because the two accused criminals are US Senators. AG Eric Holder refused. After ABC News broke the story, one outlet described the criminal accusations against Senators Reid and Lee as,  a massive crime ring that involves gambling, bribery, kickbacks and influence peddling. Protecting the Director of the Office of National Intelligence   In 2013, ODNI Director James Clapper testified to Congress that the NSA isn t collecting massive amounts of intelligence on all Americans as Edward Snowden s leaks revealed. He later admitted that his testimony was a lie, but that in the interest of national security, he was above the law and not answerable to Congress. A number of Congressmen called on AG Holder to charge Clapper with Contempt of Congress. Eric Holder refused.War on Medical Marijuana Patients   Even though medical marijuana is legal on the state, county and local level in 23 states and DC, the DoJ has led hundreds of military-style raids on legal medical marijuana pharmacies across the country. Rather than target drug cartels and illegal drug dealers, the DoJ has violently arrested hundreds of cancer victims, AIDS patients, dying senior citizens and war wounded.",politics,"Jul 1, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
“We are progressive”: Activist Defends $190K Payout To Illegal Alien By Taxpayers For Being Turned Over To ICE [Video],"Immigration advocate Roberto Hernandez joined Tucker Carlson to debate the controversial payout of $190K to an illegal for being turned over to ICE. You won t believe the reasoning! This is insane!An illegal immigrant is set to be awarded $190,000 from San Francisco after police turned him over to immigration authorities, which is a violation of the city s sanctuary policy. Pedro Figueroa-Zarceno, who is from El Salvador and was living in the U.S. illegally, walked into a police station on December 2, 2015, to recover his stolen car. When he left the station, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) immediately took him into custody. Figueroa-Zarceno recently reached the massive settlement agreement with the city attorney s office. The agreement must be approved by the city s Board of Supervisors.Tucker argued it s  insane  that the city is paying Hernandez because they actually enforced U.S. federal immigration law.  You shouldn t pay a criminal for breaking the law,  Tucker said.Hernandez said that San Francisco has a sanctuary policy because citizens and city leaders believe that the federal government s immigration policy has failed.  In San Francisco, we are different. We are progressive. We think different. We re leaders when it comes to being humanitarians,  Hernandez said.Tucker asked why San Francisco is willing to ignore federal law, but only for illegal immigrants.  If I m wanted for tax evasion in another state and the San Francisco police turn me over to the feds, why shouldn t I be able to sue the city of San Francisco for cooperating with the federal authorities?

MSNBC “Equal Rights” Lawyer: Trump Women “Have Smaller Minds than his Small Hands” [Video],"Tamara Holder was a guest on Joy Reid s MSNBC show this morning and mocked the women in President Trump s life. Ironically, Holder was billed as an  equal rights attorney and advocate . Here she is mocking the women in Donald Trump s life BUT she claims to be an advocate for  equal rights .Holder was peeved that women surrounding Trump had failed to condemn him over his tweets directed at Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough: I think the women in Donald Trump s life probably have smaller minds than his small hands . . . he has continued to surround himself, Donald Trump, with very, very, weak-minded women, who are afraid of him. Holder had mentioned Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Kellyanne Conway, and First Lady Melania Trump in her earlier comments.Small minds? Weak-minded? Afraid? Holder s comments are laughable at best but only prove the nastiness and double standard of the left. Has Tamara Holder ever been in a toe-to-toe conversation or debate with any of these women? Nope!We would love, love, love to see Holder go toe-to-toe with any of these strong women!",politics,"Jul 1, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
FOX LEGAL EXPERT: Susan Rice Committed 3 Crimes…“Better Get Herself a Good Criminal Defense Attorney” [Video],"FOX News Legal Expert Gregg Jarrett dropped a bomb on Susan Rice when he said she likely committed three crimes. Jarrett was on with Sara Carter of Circa News when he made the claim of criminal behavior by Rice.Gregg Jarrett: Susan Rice, whose got a lot to answer for. She is sort of the Queen of the False Narrative which is a polite way of saying  lie.  She not only lied about the Benghazi case and Bowe Bergdahl but then she hauls off and tells Judy Woodruff,  I don t know anything about incidental collection  and then when she gets caught red-handed she says,  OK, I knew all about it, but I never asked for the unmasking on Trump Transition officials.  Well now the NSC has the goods on her and that appears to be a lie as well. So she may have actually committed three potential crimes here. One, it s a crime to lie about your masking request. Two, it s a crime for you to use your office for political purpose. Three, it s a crime to leak unmasked details. She better get herself a good criminal defense attorney.OUR LATEST REPORT ON SUSAN RICE WHO JUST CAN T FIGURE OUT WHY SHE S BEING TARGETED: Susan Rice, the Obama national security adviser under fire over her alleged involvement in the  unmasking  of Trump associates during the 2016 presidential election, suggested in a fresh interview that race and gender might be playing a role in the scrutiny she s faced. PLEASE NOTE OUR PREVIOUS REPORT BELOW ON THE RADICAL PAST AND RACISM OF SUSAN RICE. The nerve of this woman who went on 5 morning shows after Benghazi and LIED to the American people! In an interview with journalist Michael Tomasky for New York Magazine, Rice reportedly questioned the criticism she s faced dating back to the Benghazi controversy. Why me? Why not Jay Carney, for example, who was then our press secretary, who stood up more?  she asked.Tomasky noted in the piece that Carney  isn t an African-American woman, of course  and apparently asked Rice whether that is the key factor. Rice, in response, left the door open: I don t know  I do not leap to the simple explanation that it s only about race and gender. I m trying to keep my theories to myself until I m ready to come out with them. It s not because I don t have any. But Rice mentioned other prominent female figures   like Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice   who faced  ad hominem  attacks, suggesting a correlation.Asked about the comments, a Republican Capitol Hill source pushed back.  This is screaming out for attention  She s saying I don t know why they all started picking on me to begin with. As to the suggestion of race and gender being a factor, the source countered, then  why would there be a subpoena for a white male? That was a reference to the fact that Rice is not the only focus of the congressional probe into unmasking. Investigators have issued subpoenas to three different agencies: NSA, CIA and FBI.Playing the victim is the usual tactic of leftists like Susan Rice she was a college radical before she cleaned up her resume and put on a business suit:RACIST VICTIM SUSAN RICE HAD A STRING OF FAILURES IN AFRICA BEFORE BENGHAZI   HER RACIST CLAIM THAT NATIONAL SECURITY ISN T DIVERSE ENOUGH SO NOT AS EFFECTIVE CAUSED A FIRESTORM:From 1995 to 1997, Rice served as Special Assistant to President Bill Clinton and senior director for African Affairs at the NSC at the White House.The Daily Caller:  U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, reportedly the leading contender to be President Barack Obama s next national security adviser, failed during the 1990s to prevent unnecessary deaths in Rwanda, provide adequate security prior to the bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, or deal effectively with Robert Mugabe s dictatorship in Zimbabwe.A former State Department military adviser to Africa thought Rice s  inexperience  caused President Bill Clinton s feckless response to the Rwandan genocide when she served as National Security Council director for International Organizations and Peacekeeping. And documents sent to The Daily Caller from the National Legal and Policy Center show Rice failed to take seriously repeated Islamist threats against the U.S. embassies in the prelude to deadly bomb attacks. This woman has ZERO credibility and is a true racist who would be tossed out of her job if she were white and said government was too black. Furthermore, she s giving a commencement speech and she s politicizing it!SUSAN RICE FELT STUDENTS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE BLACK HISTORY: In a 1986 book by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, the future diplomat argued for the aggressive inclusion of a black history curriculum in American schools, claiming that its omission had  crippling effects  by  providing a child with no more than   a white interpretation of reality. She s yet another one of Obama s minions with a radical racist past who s pushing the Obama agenda of a  fundamental transformation . Rice attended Stanford University and was a black radical back in the day is anyone surprised by this? Probably not In a White House often accused of being stacked with loyalists, President Obama s national security adviser said Wednesday there are too many white people in key government posts, endangering national security because they think alike.Speaking at Florida International University s commencement, Susan E. Rice, who is black, said a diversified government workforce is more likely to yield  better outcomes  than a predominantly white one.Referring to criticism that the U.S. national security workforce is  white, male and Yale,  Ms. Rice told the graduates,  In the halls of power, in the faces of our national security leaders, America is still not fully reflected. By now, we should all know the dangers of  groupthink,  where folks who are alike often think alike,  she said.  By contrast, groups comprised of different people tend to question one another s assumptions, draw on divergent perspectives and experiences, and yield better outcomes. Her comments were reminiscent of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who said in a speech in 2001, before Mr. Obama appointed her to the high court,  I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn t lived that life. Ms. Rice elaborated in her speech on how having more minorities in the national security field would better protect the homeland.Read more: WT Read more: FOX News",politics,"Jul 1, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
WATCH: MSNBC’S HATE-FILLED LIBERAL Host Chris Matthews Makes Joke About President Trump Assassinating His Son-In-Law…No Media Outrage,"RCP   In just a few minutes on Thursday s edition of  Hardball  on MSNBC, host Chris Matthews compared President Trump and his family to Saddam Hussein and his sons, the Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, Italian fascist Benito Mussolini, and the deposed Russian royal family, the Romanovs.Here s a portion of the transcript:MATTHEWS: Is it a royal family instead of a Democratic or a Republican form of government? Or is it a family running the government? Is it Ivanka and Jared and the President sitting around in the White House upstairs ruling the world?ASHLEY PARKER: I don t think it s quite that but I think it is run like a family business. The president and his aides see it publicly and privately and the President s family, his children, especially his daughter Ivanka and, you know, Jared Kushner, they operate with a degree of impunity that does not exist for these other aides. So, if you look at just Jared and Tillerson, Jared basically emerged as a shadow Secretary of State. You mentioned peace in the Middle East. His portfolio includes not only that, it includes China, it includes Mexico, it includes Canada and that s just on the foreign policy front. So, if you re the secretary of state, ambassadors and leaders of foreign nations know that they can directly go to the President s son-in-law and have his ear that deeply undermines you and makes it really difficult for you to do your job.MATTHEWS: And then you find out in all these investigations that Jared was opening up a tunnel to Moscow so he wouldn t have to deal with the State Department. So the son-in-law   you know, one good thing Mussolini did was execute his son-in-law. I mean, I m talking about CianoFRANK BRUNI: Let s be careful here, yeah.Much like the vile and repulsive comments made by other leftists in the media or in Hollywood, Matthews disgusting remarks will be completely ignored by the media, as this type of hateful rhetoric has been deemed perfectly acceptable by their peers, as long as the hate is directed at President Trump, his family or his supporters, everything is fair game ",politics,"Jul 1, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

NANCY PELOSI Confused About Time: “Is it afternoon?” and Forgets What She Said Minutes Before…Term Limits Now! [Video],"Nancy Pelosi had another strange moment during her weekly press conference as she was confused about what time of day it was, struggled to recall her latest accusations against Russia just six minutes later, and again awkwardly stopped speaking mid-sentence and stared at reporters before resuming Classic Pelosi As Pelosi approached the podium on Thursday, she muttered to herself on the hot mic,  It s afternoon. It is afternoon. Good afternoon everyone. She then immediately got confused about what time of day it was. Thank you for being here. I m honored this morning, or now afternoon  she said. She went on to refer to her Democratic colleague as the  chairman  of a committee, before correcting herself and calling him the  ranking member. Going off script proved to be a disaster.While denouncing Republican attempts to replace Obamacare, Pelosi said,  And what does that mean? Higher costs, fewer benefits, uh, terrible age tax undermining Medicare, uh, uh, stealing from Medicare and Maid-icaid, as I should have said,  mispronouncing the word.A statement about Medicaid left the listener to wonder what other things Pelosi thinks are covered by the program. As they do this, they re making an assault on Medicaid, which is, again, very dangerous to children and other living ch  things,  she said.  AND OTHER LIVING THINGS ? HAHA! Pelosi then criticized Republicans on the  hacking  by Russia:  They hacked our democracy. Twenty-one state, local election systems were per  penetrated. Six minutes later, she struggled to remember the accusation Oy vey! We re finding out things that we didn t even know before.

MARK LEVIN Destroys Joe Scarborough…Defends Trump In Epic Rant [Video],"Conservative talk show host Mark Levin shredded Joe Scarborough and the media in defense of President Trump as he pointed out that respect is a two-way street.Levin, author of the book  Rediscovering Americanism: And the Tyranny of Progressivism,  said a  man s man  like Trump can only take so much before he s  gonna stand up,  as he spoke with Fox News  Sean Hannity on the controversy over the president s tweets about MSNBC s  Morning Joe  and its co-host Mika Brzezinski You attack a man repeatedly who s a proud man, who s an accomplished man, who is a man s man. You attack him personally. You attack him for his looks. You attack him for his genitalia. And at some point, a man s gonna stand up,  Levin said on  Hannity  Thursday. You want him to act presidential? Then you have respect for the office of the president,  he added.While Levin understood the outrage, he admitted his only objection to the tweet was because it  jacked up the ratings  for MSNBC.Levin thinks the meltdown by the left reveals a deeper issue: You know, it s nice to know where the liberals finally draw the line on this tweet by this president,  Levin told Hannity, pointing out that liberals were not bothered by former President Clinton, who  was accused of rape and molesting and sexually attacking women in the Oval Office,  nor were they bothered by Ted Kennedy. But Trump s tweet appears to be where the hypocritical left draws the line of acceptable behavior, Levin noted. So the bottom line is, MSNBC has a problem. From morning until night, it s the same damn show with different people, different dresses, different suits. It s the same thing. Levin then suggested that President Trump should keep tweeting Via: BPR",politics,"Jun 30, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

THE DEATH OF P.C. POLICE? Trump’s DOJ Makes Major Announcement Over “Redskins” Name,"The Justice Department on Thursday dropped the legal challenge to the the Washington Redskins  name, the Associated Press reported.According to the AP, the Trump administration dropped the challenge in a letter to the Supreme Court in response to last week s ruling in Matal V. Tam, in which an Asian-American rock band won the right to copyright the name  The Slants,  despite the name s offensive connotation.In the Thursday letter, the Justice Department argues that the Matal V. Tam decision means that the court would decide in favor of the Washington Redskins if the case went before the justices.Last week, Redskins owner Dan Snyder drew the same conclusion, and said he was  thrilled  by the court s decision in the copyright case His lawyer, Lisa Blatt, issued a  statement saying that the court s decision resolved the dispute over the NFL team s name.Washington Post  Nine in 10 Native Americans say they are not offended by the Washington Redskins name, according to a new Washington Post poll that shows how few ordinary Indians have been persuaded by a national movement to change the football team s moniker.Among the Native Americans reached over a five-month period ending in April, more than 7 in 10 said they did not feel the word  Redskin  was disrespectful to Indians. An even higher number   8 in 10   said they would not be offended if a non-native called them that name. The Washington Redskins team, our fans and community have always believed our name represents honor, respect and pride,  the owner said in a statement.  Today s Washington Post polling shows Native Americans agree. We are gratified by this overwhelming support from the Native American community, and the team will proudly carry the Redskins name. Watch: Snyder and his wife have a close relationship with President Trump and his administration. In January, Snyder attended an exclusive inauguration celebration with Trump s Cabinet members, and Snyder s wife donated to Trump s campaign in 2015.Weeks after Snyder s wife made the donation, Trump spoke out about the team name controversy, suggesting it should remain the Redskins. I know Indians that are extremely proud of that name,  Trump said in October of 2015. Honestly, I don t think they should change the name, unless the owner wanted to.

BREAKING: CNN PRODUCER Caught On Undercover Video Trashing Trump: “Voters “Stupid as Sh*t” [Video],"Project Veritas  newest video from the American Pravda: CNN series exposes Jimmy Carr, the Associate Producer for CNN s New Day attacking President Donald Trump and admitting that CNN has a left-leaning bias. When asked by an undercover journalist if CNN is impartial, Carr plainly responded,  In theory. We reported on the previous videos from Project Veritas: James O Keefe s Project Veritas reporters went undercover at CNN to investigate the #VeryFakeNews network to determine the motivation behind CNN s Trump-Russia collusion obsession. Since the inauguration, CNN has mentioned  Russian story  nearly 16,000 times.Project Veritas  reporters can be seen in the video below having a conversation with CNN s supervising producer John Bonifield. The reporter talked to Bonifield first about the constant barrage of Trump-Russia stories on CNN. Bonifield admitted that although CNN has no evidence or proof of Trump involvement with Russia, they continue to make it their top story on CNN simply for  ratings  and to  make money.  Bonifield has worked as a journalist and as a producer for nearly 15 years at CNN, making him a pretty reliable source when it comes to how things work at CNN.Bonifield actually confessed to the undercover Project Veritas journalist that President Trump is correct when he says the media is on a  witch hunt  to take him down. Bonifield told the reporter:  I think the President is right to say, like, look you are  witch hunting me  You have no real smoking gun, you have no proof. Bonifield told the undercover reporter for Project Veritas that CNN is biased and is playing to their audience by attacking President Trump, and actually admitted that  Trump is good for business right now.  The Project Veritas reporter asked Bonifield,  But honestly, you think the whole Russia shit is bullshit?  to which Bonifield replied:  Could be bullshit. I mean, it s mostly bullshit right now. Like, we don t have any big, giant proof. The way these leaks happen, they d leak it. It d leak. If it was something really good, it would leak. Watch the unbelievable video here:Did the three resignations that took place at CNN today have anything to do with the impending release of O Keefe s explosive video proving that CNN manufactures Trump-Russia collusion stories for ratings, or for money?The story about the three CNN employees resigning for publishing fake news broke yesterday. Is ti a coincidence that today, O Keefe released this explosive bombshell video?Here s the story that broke yesterday: CNN employees have resigned for their role in pushing fake news about the Trump-Russia story that claimed a member of the Trump transition team was under investigation.Reporter Thomas Frank, editor Eric Lichtblau and executive editor Lex Haris all resigned from their positions following a company-wide investigation into the single-sourced story that was quickly debunked, The Washington Post first reported. CNN quickly followed up with a story of their own on the resignations. Lichtblau reportedly oversaw the false story, while Haris headed up CNN s investigative unit. In the aftermath of the retraction of a story published on CNN.com, CNN has accepted the resignations of the employees involved in the story s publication,  CNN s coverage quotes a company spokesman as saying.Philly.com   On Thursday evening, CNN investigative reporter Thomas Frank published a potentially explosive report involving an investigation of a Russian investment fund with potential ties to several associates of President Donald Trump.But by Friday night, the story was removed from CNN s website and all links were scrubbed from the network s social media accounts. That story did not meet CNN s editorial standards and has been retracted,  CNN said in an editors note posted in place of the story.  Links to the story have been disabled.

PLAYBOY “REPORTER” WHINES About Getting No Respect From Trump’s Female Deputy Press Secretary [VIDEO],"Only a liberal  man  who works for a magazine that made a fortune by exploiting women would complain that President Trump s female Deputy Press Secretary isn t giving him enough respect. Yesterday a 56-year-old reporter representing Playboy magazine had an epic meltdown in the White House press briefing room after White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders put him in his place following the release of an undercover bombshell video by Project Veritas that exposed CNN as a network that fabricates news for ratings.Brian Karem complained about journalists being called out as  fake news  when they report falsehoods, and protested on behalf of the honor of all White House journalists.  Conservative TreehouseIn an effort to capitalize on his moment in the sun, today 56-year-old Brian Karem runs to the Associated Press and claims Sarah Sanders and Sean Spicer (White House Press Secretaries) are  bullying him  and not giving him enough respect:AP   The reporter who accused White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders of inflaming the public against the media at a press briefing says he did it because he s tired of being bullied by the administration. There s a time and a place for everything and the time has come to stand up and be counted,  Karem told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  I m tired of taking it. I want friendly relationships, but those who want respect, show respect. We have shown that man and shown the administration respect for six months, and all we re getting in return is a lack of respect, derision and bullying. Karem, 56, is not a representative of the large national media organizations repeatedly described as  fake news  by the president. Besides his editing, he writes for Playboy, where his first-person account of the confrontation was posted late Tuesday. Note to Brian Karem: when a woman like Sarah Huckabee Sanders stands her ground and defends a man she respects and admires that s been unjustly accused of wrongdoing, is not called  bullying she s simply not allowing herself to be steamrolled by the bullies in the media BOOOM Sarah Huckabee Sanders advises ALL to watch Veritas Video where CNN producer admits they realize Trump/Russia is a hoax but dont care! pic.twitter.com/tng5DUmKq3   STOCK MONSTER  (@StockMonsterUSA) June 27, 2017",politics,"Jun 29, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"CNBC EDITOR: Media Must Remember Readers Are Not ‘as Ignorant, as Stupid as We Think They Are’ [Video]","A CNBC editor said members of the press need to remind themselves that their readers  are not as ignorant, as stupid as we think they are  during a discussion Wednesday on media in the Donald Trump era. Unbelievable arrogance!In a panel moderated by Katie Couric at the Aspen Ideas Festival, a CNBC Editor and Wall Street Journal editor Gerard Baker, The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, Time editor Nancy Gibbs and USA Today editor Joanne Lipman delved into the challenges of covering Trump and declining trust in the news media.In one portion, Couric brought up the problem of confirmation bias in the media. She s all wrong on this point   this just shows how out of touch the media is with Americans. Americans want the TRUTH and DO NOT want to be spoon-fed information. Couric is making assumptions that Americans are idiiots SHE S VERY WRONG! Consumers are increasingly gravitating toward outlets that basically tell them what they want to hear, reinforce their beliefs,  she said. A friend of mine said they re seeking affirmation, not information. So given that, how do you restore trust in the media writ large if people are so divided about which media outlets are actually fair and accurate? KATIE COURIC: Let s move on and talk about sort of the bifurcated nature of the media these days. Consumers are increasingly gravitating toward outlets that basically tell them what they want to hear, reinforce their beliefs. A friend of mine said they re seeking affirmation, not information. So given that, how do you restore trust in the media writ large if people are so divided about which media outlets are actually fair and accurate? Anybody. Nik, you want to take that?NIKHIL DEOGUN: Sure, and I would say that the I think Gerry [Baker] made a very eloquent argument on the previous point, and it leads to what you re asking about, which is, I think there is a tendency we should not fall under the trap of just holding one person to one standard and everyone else to a different standard. I do think it s interesting. Three of us have all worked at the Wall Street Journal or work at the Wall Street Journal GERARD BAKER: I did before I left the office this morning.DEOGUN: Yes. Exactly. And our former Gerry s predecessor, a couple predecessors ago, Paul Steiger, used to always remind us, saying,  Look, I could argue something round or I could argue it flat. But in the end, stick to the facts.  I think sometimes there s too much of a tendency to interpret a fact to a degree that it goes into opinion. And I think part of our job is to, again, remind ourselves that our readers are not as readers, viewers, users, are not as ignorant, as stupid as we think they are, and I think part of that is to be more transparent. Part of that is to be more forthcoming about what we know and what we don t know. First rule we all learned is don t just tell your readers what you know, please tell them what you do not know.THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA JUST DOESN T GET IT!

HEATED! MARIA BARTIROMO Goes At It With John Podesta On Russia Probe “Get your facts straight!” [Video],"John Podesta is the guardian of the Clintons just like Valerie Jarrett was for the Obamas.  He was instrumental during the 2016 election as the Clinton campaign chair and was exposed when the Wikileaks hack happened. He was just interviewed by the House Intel Committee regarding the Russia scam and was asked about it in the heated debate below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9U5zxVyTqAJohn Podesta is not just the former chairman of the Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign, but also a central figure in the ongoing narrative of Russian meddling in the US election of 2016. His hacked emails were at the heart of what some have called a coordinated news campaign led by Wikileaks, and so he met with the House Intelligence panel yesterday behind closed doors.This morning he appeared on Fox Business to discuss the Russian interference, allegations of collusion with Trump campaign and more with host Maria Bartiromo in what became a testy debate that perfectly exemplifies the divided positions that so many Americans hold right now.Bartiromo showed skepticism over the Russia claims rightfully so!. And there may be no other individual that best embodies the Clinton s web of influence   for good and bad   than Mr. Podesta. He s the definition of a weasel.Bartiromo aggressively attacked Podesta and Democrats for what she said were deeper ties with Russia, specifically asking about Podesta s investment portfolio:THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF A  DEEP TIE  TO RUSSIA:Russia gave John Podesta 35 millions dollars (1 billion rubles) while he advised Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.Russia gave John Podesta 35 millions dollars (1 billion rubles) while he advised Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. pic.twitter.com/cf042XZLeU  Based Vet   (@BasedVet) March 28, 2017 Get your facts straight,  the former Clinton campaign chair shot back, before dismissing the FBN hosts claims as coming from a dubious source  like InfoWars.

NYC COP Congratulates Trump Supporter For Educating Young Girl On Truth About Communism…”Facts Hurt People’s Feelings” [VIDEO],"Based Stickman, aka Kyle Chapman became famous on social media after he was one of the first Trump supporters to fight back at a California Trump rally after violent Antifa thugs randomly began cracking skulls and stabbing people who dared to openly supporting our President. Americans were fed up with watching innocent Americans being physically harmed and threatened while police officers stood down and watched the violence unfold. Once Kyle Chapman took the lead and started fighting back, other Trump supporters joined him. It wasn t long before the Antifa cowards stopped attacking innocent Trump supporters.Here s a short video showing  Base Stick Man  in action, as he takes the lead in defending his fellow Trump supporters who were being attack by a large mob of violent Democrats:Communists/Anarchists start a fight they cant finish @ UC Berkeley #March4Trump pic.twitter.com/OoZJrzkxXG  Andrew Quackson (@AndrewQuackson) March 5, 2017Today, Kyle Chapman (Based Stickman) and conservative Latino activist Robert Herrera were on the streets of New York showing their support for President Trump when Chapman noticed a 15-yr. old girl proudly displaying a communist poster her mother allegedly purchased for her. Chapman questioned the young girl about her knowledge of communism and asked her if she s aware of the millions of people who have been murdered throughout history at the hands of communist dictators? The 15-yr. old girl s mother can be seen videotaping the exchange until she realizes that her daughter is actually getting an education about the ugly truth about Communism, at which time she asks Chapman to stop engaging her daughter while videotaping her. As the mother-daughter duo walk away, the New York City police officer who witnessed the entire exchange can be seen stepping up to congratulate Chapman on a job well done. The unidentified police officer remarks about how he appreciated the way in which Chapman conducted himself with civility. As the officer begins to move away, he can be heard remarking,  Facts hurt people s feelings .Watch:Although Based Stickman was arrested and charged with assault for defending himself and other Trump supporters from Antifa thugs, it hasn t slowed down his enthusiasm for defending President Trump or innocent Americans who are simply exercising their First Amendment Right. America could use a thousand more Kyle Chapman s and Robert Herrera s ",politics,"Jun 29, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

WOW! TRUMP REVEALS Embarrassing Story About Anti-Trump MSNBC Hacks “Crazy Mika” and “Psycho Joe” [VIDEO],"Some day, when things calm down, I'll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure long-time girlfriend, @morningmika. Two clowns!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2016FOX News host Sean Hannity exposed the rabid liberal anti-Trump vitriol that MSNBC hacks spew daily on their show. Hannity offered to pay for therapy for one year for both of them, as a way to help them cope with Trump s presidency:Today, President Donald Trump turned his ire on MSNBC s Joe Scarborough and his fianc  Mika Brzezinski once again, branding them with new nicknames and dishing embarrassing details about their relationship.Trump called Scarborough  Psycho Joe  on Twitter Thursday morning and labeled his co-host Brzezinski  low I.Q. Crazy Mika. I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017He recalled that the television couple both wanted to join him during a New Year s Eve party at his Mar-a-lago club, but he refused. to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017Trump again insisted that he did not watch their show anymore but was told that the couple  speaks badly of me. Prior to Trump s tweets, the pair sneered mockingly at Trump because of his healthcare bill and started ridiculing the president because of a fake TIME magazine cover spotted in his golf club.Brzezinski mocked the photo of the cover, calling Trump s hands  teensy  and said he was  lying every day and destroying the country :First lady Melania Trump s office also reacted to the news. As the First Lady has stated publicly in the past, when her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder,  the statement from the first lady s office read.In January, news of Scarborough s visit to Trump s club leaked, prompting mockery from fellow journalists. In response, an outraged Scarborough insisted he was not there to spend time with Trump socially but wanted to set up an interview.

Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) June 29, 2017Watson also (rightly) points out in another tweet that there is more outrage from the left over Trump s tweet about the MSNBC hack team, than about the attempted massacre of Republicans only a few weeks ago:There's more outrage over Trump's Mika Brzezinski tweet than the attempted massacre of Republicans.

WOW! LEGENDARY ACTOR JEFF BRIDGES Sends A Shocking Message To President Trump,"Well, this is a shocker! It takes a brave person to speak up in Hollywood because they could be blacklisted for being supportive of President Trump. We re guessing Jeff Bridges doesn t care what the Hollywood elite thinks because he s been around for decades acting, singing and producing. We love what he had to say about Trump! Who knew he s veteran too!Jeff Bridges played a president in  The Contender,  a political flick released nearly two decades ago in the wake of President Bill Clinton s White House scandals. But when it comes to critiquing the role of today s real-life president, Bridges is a lot more laid back than some of his fellow celebrities. How would The Dude, the character he played in  The Big Lebowski,  handle things? He likely wouldn t be dangling a severed head in the likeness of President Donald Trump, as comedian Kathy Griffin came under fire for. Neither would The Dude joke about killing the president as Johnny Depp recently did. Griffin and Depp later apologized.  Everybody has something different and unique to contribute to society and with different ways of doing it,  Bridges said in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press, after taking part on a panel focused on child hunger at a meeting of the Western Governors Association in Whitefish, Montana.  Some people will be blatantly out there talking about their disappointments and ridiculing the way President Trump is acting,  said Bridges, who supported Hillary Clinton in last year s election.  I m rooting for him to do well by our country,  he said.  I m rooting for him as a human being to do the cool thing. WHO KNEW? JEFF BRIDGES IS A VETERAN! What do Beau Bridges, Jeff Bridges and Lloyd Bridges have in common? Ok  yes  they are all well-known actors  and yes they are all related! But all three have something very patriotic in common!They all proudly served our country in the United States Coast Guard. From left to right: Jeff Bridges (True Grit, The Big Lebowski, Oscar for Crazy Heart) served 7 years in the Coast Guard Reserve. Beau Bridges (The Fabulous Baker Boys, The Fifth Musketeer) served 8 years in the Coast Guard Reserve. And Father to Jeff and Beau, Lloyd Bridges (Around the World Under the Sea, Airplane!, Hot Shots) left Columbia Pictures to join the Coast Guard during WWII. After returning to film acting he then joined the Coast Guard Auxiliary, 11th District in California. Lloyd later did a number of public service announcements for the Coast Guard and was appointed an honorary USCG Commodore.BRIDGES HAS WORKED ON CHILD HUNGER FOR DECADES: Bridges said he is especially concerned about proposed cuts to federal food assistance programs, which he said could harm the well-being of more children. The actor has been an ambassador for  No Kid Hungry   campaign, a national effort to address food insecurity among struggling families. He founded the End Hunger Network in 1983 and became the national spokesman for No Kid Hungry in 2010. Bridges splits his time between homes in Southern California and Montana. He has helped Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and the state s first lady, Lisa Bullock, on expanding school breakfast programs.  The health of our children is a wonderful compass that can tell us if our country is going the right direction,  he said.  That means we re off course, so I m rooting for the president to get on course.

AMERICANS ARE LAUGHING At Michael Moore When They See Dates He Chose For Democrats To “RISE UP!” and “Storm” Offices Of Senators,"The Washington Post published a propaganda organizing piece for the Democrat Party: Democrats  resistance  calls for a July 4th recess push to kill GOP billFrom the article: The moment that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told Republicans that there could be no vote on the party s health-care bill this week, Senate Democrats were in a familiar position   headed to a protest.In the  Senate swamp,  a well-kept lawn across from the Capitol, hundreds of activists from Planned Parenthood, AFSCME and smaller progressive groups were hooting and cheering their latest mini-victory. The  People s Filibuster,  scheduled to last all week, had triumphed in its first few minutes. The delay of BRCA, which Republicans had hoped to vote on this week, came after disagreements inside the majority party. But it was egged on by the  Resistance,  the loose collection of more than 1,000 groups working to stop the Republican agenda that sprang out of Trump s surprise election.  A bill designed by wealthy white men, for wealthy white men will only further marginalize disenfranchised communities,  said the organizers of the Jan. 21 Women s March in a statement.  While a delay on the vote is a small victory, it s time to crank up the outrage and tell all Senators to vote NO. The call to action that has everyone on social media laughing however was a tweet by Michael Moore who suggested liberals  storm  ( nonviolently ) the local offices of Senators and  pack  their town halls. Hmmm .Is there such a thing as  nonviolently  storming someone s office? Perhaps someone should tell the irrelevant Michael Moore that the Senators don t work over the July 4th weekend.I call upon EVERYONE to observe this 4th of July week by nonviolently storming the local offices of your Senators, pack town halls, RISE UP!  Michael Moore (@MMFlint) June 28, 2017Moore got called out on Twitter by several people who were smart enough to figure out the Senate would be on recess or that  storming  offices of US Senators was anything but  nonviolent :His EVERYONE = Flint's & #OFA Soros paid violent protesters.BTW, storming is violent.#July4th @FBI  adnilhoom  (@adnilhoom) June 29, 2017What is the point in storming offices that are going to be completely empty because July 4th is a holiday, you utter moron? https://t.co/o8eIaKkr4f  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) June 29, 2017Yes, YES! Storm offices that will be closed on the 4th of July. pic.twitter.com/owUNMI7C5y  The Mental Recession (@rustyweiss74) June 29, 2017The most embarrassing propaganda piece we could find was USA Today s piece titled:USA Today joined in with other leftist propaganda rags in an effort to help the left organize agains our President and the GOP. Yesterday, they ran a one-sided fear mongering article that was clearly designed to motivate Democrats to spend their extended holiday weekend harassing Republican Senators to change their votes on the replacement bill for the failed Obamacare.In an effort to discredit the efforts of the GOP, USA Today s propaganda piece mentions how Republican Senators are not 100% on board with the bill. USA Today even offers their readers a George Soros resource to help them find ways to resist our President and the GOP agenda.USA today also offered their readers a heavy dose of fear with a Youtube video featuring a woman named  Priscilla  and her 38-year-old daughter who has cerebral palsy and could die from seizures without health insurance.USA Today also featured 2 tweets in their article showing Americans who are singing the praises of Obamacare. Every day, we see horror stories about Americans who were financially devastated by Obamacare, not one of those stories appeared in the lopsided USA Today article. These 2 tweets were apparently the only examples a major publication like USA Today could find in their embarrassing propaganda piece:B/c of the ACA I was able to give a kidney to my husband @kevinbehr when he needed it.

They also point out that according to polls, most Americans disagree with the GOP and want taxpayers to pay for everyone s health care:  Republicans will have their own messaging campaign, as they try to tie all Democrats to comments made by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is pressing for a single-payer health care system, in which the government would run a health insurance program available to any American.Republicans plan to have their own digital campaign and hold press conferences that include testimonials from Americans who ve been  negatively impacted  by Obamacare, said Republican National Committee spokesman Rick Gorka.Yet McConnell has acknowledged if Republicans can t pass a bill soon, they may have to work with Democrats, who will demand preserving the current Obamacare program by shoring up the individual market exchanges. People get really emotional about health care, but Republicans have clearly lost the narrative on this, and the discussion has moved towards  Who are you taking health care away from?  said former Republican House member Tom Davis of Virginia, who previously headed reelection efforts for his party.Republicans worry Democrats will ultimately push for a single-payer system that is anathema to their limited-government, free-market driven ideology. Once a politically toxic prospect   Hillary Clinton faced significant blow back as first lady for her 1990 s flirtation with universal health care that stopped short of single payer   polls now show modest increases in support for such a system.A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found 33% of respondents favor a single-payer system. More relevant to the current debate, 60% said the federal government is responsible for providing healthcare coverage to all Americans. In an interview on MSNBC, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, D-OH, who represents a working-class area including Youngstown, also expressed support for single-payerAdditional polling also suggests Democrats have a running start on public opinion heading into the break. According to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll, just 12% of Americans support the Republican plan, a similar number other major surveys including by Marist. NBC News/Wall Street Journal found just 16% of adults believe the House bill was a good idea.

"SUSAN RICE Plays Race, Gender Bias Card On Why She’s Being ‘Picked On’ About ‘Unmasking’ Of Trump Associates","Susan Rice, the Obama national security adviser under fire over her alleged involvement in the  unmasking  of Trump associates during the 2016 presidential election, suggested in a fresh interview that race and gender might be playing a role in the scrutiny she s faced. PLEASE NOTE OUR PREVIOUS REPORT BELOW ON THE RADICAL PAST AND RACISM OF SUSAN RICE. The nerve of this woman who went on 5 morning shows after Benghazi and LIED to the American people! In an interview with journalist Michael Tomasky for New York Magazine, Rice reportedly questioned the criticism she s faced dating back to the Benghazi controversy. Why me? Why not Jay Carney, for example, who was then our press secretary, who stood up more?  she asked.Tomasky noted in the piece that Carney  isn t an African-American woman, of course  and apparently asked Rice whether that is the key factor. Rice, in response, left the door open: I don t know  I do not leap to the simple explanation that it s only about race and gender. I m trying to keep my theories to myself until I m ready to come out with them. It s not because I don t have any. But Rice mentioned other prominent female figures   like Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice   who faced  ad hominem  attacks, suggesting a correlation.Asked about the comments, a Republican Capitol Hill source pushed back.  This is screaming out for attention  She s saying I don t know why they all started picking on me to begin with. As to the suggestion of race and gender being a factor, the source countered, then  why would there be a subpoena for a white male? That was a reference to the fact that Rice is not the only focus of the congressional probe into unmasking. Investigators have issued subpoenas to three different agencies: NSA, CIA and FBI.Playing the victim is the usual tactic of leftists like Susan Rice she was a college radical before she cleaned up her resume and put on a business suit:RACIST VICTIM SUSAN RICE HAD A STRING OF FAILURES IN AFRICA BEFORE BENGHAZI   HER RACIST CLAIM THAT NATIONAL SECURITY ISN T DIVERSE ENOUGH SO NOT AS EFFECTIVE CAUSED A FIRESTORM:From 1995 to 1997, Rice served as Special Assistant to President Bill Clinton and senior director for African Affairs at the NSC at the White House.The Daily Caller:  U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, reportedly the leading contender to be President Barack Obama s next national security adviser, failed during the 1990s to prevent unnecessary deaths in Rwanda, provide adequate security prior to the bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, or deal effectively with Robert Mugabe s dictatorship in Zimbabwe.A former State Department military adviser to Africa thought Rice s  inexperience  caused President Bill Clinton s feckless response to the Rwandan genocide when she served as National Security Council director for International Organizations and Peacekeeping. And documents sent to The Daily Caller from the National Legal and Policy Center show Rice failed to take seriously repeated Islamist threats against the U.S. embassies in the prelude to deadly bomb attacks. This woman has ZERO credibility and is a true racist who would be tossed out of her job if she were white and said government was too black. Furthermore, she s giving a commencement speech and she s politicizing it!SUSAN RICE FELT STUDENTS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE BLACK HISTORY: In a 1986 book by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, the future diplomat argued for the aggressive inclusion of a black history curriculum in American schools, claiming that its omission had  crippling effects  by  providing a child with no more than   a white interpretation of reality. She s yet another one of Obama s minions with a radical racist past who s pushing the Obama agenda of a  fundamental transformation . Rice attended Stanford University and was a black radical back in the day is anyone surprised by this? Probably not In a White House often accused of being stacked with loyalists, President Obama s national security adviser said Wednesday there are too many white people in key government posts, endangering national security because they think alike.Speaking at Florida International University s commencement, Susan E. Rice, who is black, said a diversified government workforce is more likely to yield  better outcomes  than a predominantly white one.Referring to criticism that the U.S. national security workforce is  white, male and Yale,  Ms. Rice told the graduates,  In the halls of power, in the faces of our national security leaders, America is still not fully reflected. By now, we should all know the dangers of  groupthink,  where folks who are alike often think alike,  she said.  By contrast, groups comprised of different people tend to question one another s assumptions, draw on divergent perspectives and experiences, and yield better outcomes. Her comments were reminiscent of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who said in a speech in 2001, before Mr. Obama appointed her to the high court,  I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn t lived that life. Ms. Rice elaborated in her speech on how having more minorities in the national security field would better protect the homeland.Read more: WT Read more: FOX News",politics,"Jun 28, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Photos of McCabe campaigning for his wife raised questions about McCabe s compliance with the law.Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is being investigated by the Office of U.S. Special Counsel for violating The Hatch Act that prohibits FBI agents from campaigning in partisan races.The Office of U.S. Special Counsel, the government s main whistleblower agency, is investigating whether FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe s activities supporting his wife Jill s Democratic campaign for Virginia state senate in 2015 violated the Hatch Act s prohibition against FBI agents campaigning in partisan races. I am voting for Jill because she is the best wife ever,  McCabe put on a sign that he photographed himself holding. The photo was posted on her social media page a few days before the election, in response to Dr. Jill McCabe s plea to  help me win  by posting photos expressing reasons why voters should vote for her, according to the complaint.Other social media photos in the complaint showed McCabe s minor daughter campaigning with her mother, wearing an FBI shirt, and McCabe voting with his wife at a polling station.Here is another social media photo of our acting #FBI director, #AndrewMcCabe breaking the rules by campaigning on social media. #Corrupt pic.twitter.com/hBCH29yErY  Senator Dick Black (@SenRichardBlack) May 9, 2017The Hatch Act prohibits FBI employees from engaging  in political activity in concert with a political party, a candidate for partisan political office, or a partisan political group.

An ethics expert told Circa the photos raised legitimate questions about McCabe s compliance with the law.Meanwhile, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe s office released to Circa under the Freedom of Information Act documents showing McCabe attended a meeting with his wife and the governor on a Saturday in March 2015 specifically to discuss having Jill McCabe run for state Senate in Virginia as a Democrat.

The biography made clear that Andrew McCabe was a senior executive who at the time oversaw the FBI s Washington field office that among many tasks supervised investigations in northern Virginia.At the time of the meeting, published reports indicate agents in the Washington field office were involved in both a probe of McAuliffe and of the governor s close friend, Hillary Clinton s and her private email account.h/t Gateway Pundit",politics,"Jun 28, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
“KILL YOUR A$$”: Florida Lefty Threatens GOP Congressman…Gets A Dose Of Karma!,"Only two weeks after U.S. congressman Steve Scalise and four others were shot during a baseball practice in a Washington suburb by a man with a history of lashing out at Republicans, a Florida lawmaker decided he wasn t taking any chances. After someone threatened his life on a Facebook page, state Rep. Jose Felix Diaz, R-Miami, told police. HADN T TAKEN HIS MEDS And on Monday, Northwest Miami-Dade resident Steve St. Felix, 34, was arrested and charged with written threats with intent to do bodily injury. Police said St. Felix was  fed up  with the Republican Party   and that he hadn t taken his meds when he posted the threat. It s unclear what condition the medications were treating.The threat    I ll kill your ass and you better not show up to the next REC meeting    was quickly removed from the Facebook page, police said. It appeared to refer to the Republican Executive Committee, the name of the local Miami-Dade County GOP.RECENT THREATS AND THE SHOOTING OF SCALISE CALL ATTENTION TO THREATS:On June 14, Steve Scalise, the U.S. House Republican whip, was badly injured during an early morning shootout in Alexandria, Virginia, as a group of Republicans practiced for their annual baseball game against Democrats.Two members of Scalise s Capitol Police security detail, a congressional aide and a lobbyist were also shot and injured. The shooter, James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old from a Belleville, Ill., a suburb outside St. Louis, was shot and killed.Two members of Scalise s baseball squad said they spoke with Hodgkinson before the practice and that he asked them what party they were affiliated with.Read more: Miami HeraldThe interesting thing is that Facebook just hired thousands to delete hate speech  Facebook hires thousands to launch crackdown on  hate speech Facebook s statement: Our current definition of hate speech is anything that directly attacks people based on what are known as their  protected characteristics    race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, or serious disability or disease,  said Richard Allan, Facebook vice president of public policy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa said in the blog post.  There is no universally accepted answer for when something crosses the line. Although a number of countries have laws against hate speech, their definitions of it vary significantly.

AS TRUMP’S POPULARITY SOARS ABROAD…Village In India Renames Itself “Trump” [VIDEO],"President Donald Trump welcomed India s Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House Monday for their first meeting, as the U.S. branded a top militant from neighboring Pakistan as a  global terrorist. The leaders of the world s two largest democracies are looking to expand ties on defense and fighting terrorism, but strains are likely on trade. Their personal chemistry could prove as important as policy in setting the tone for relations.During brief Oval Office remarks, Trump heaped praise on Modi as a  great prime minister  who had brought economic growth to India. Modi recalled Trump s visits to India long before he was president and said he was looking forward to collaborating with him now that he is president. The relationship between the United States and India is very, very strong and very, very powerful,  Trump said.  We agree on most things. And I would say, by the end of the day we ll agree on everything. I have a feeling,  he joked.Meanwhile back in India, a village is so enamored with President Trump that they ve renamed their village after him: #News: As @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's popularity soars abroad, a village in #India renames itself ""Trump"" to honour their American hero.   pic.twitter.com/3ogNWWcwMA   l g s  (@Maximus_4EVR) June 27, 2017Hours before Modi s arrival, the State Department imposed sanctions on Syed Salahuddin, the Pakistan-based leader of Hizbul Mujahideen, the main rebel group that fights against Indian control in the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir.

But instead of losing part of the ceremony, students decided to lead their own prayer.Graduation at East Liverpool is filled with tradition, and this year students rejected change. I know a lot of my student body was uncomfortable with it, just because it is tradition to have prayer at our school,  said Cami Post, class of 2016 vice president.

HILARIOUS!

We could love this more Tennessee hits back at the loony state that banned all state travel to places that they think don t have the right policy in place. The response is epic: Whereas, California has passed legislation banning state sponsored travel to Tennessee and certain other states; andWhereas, the ban stems from legislation enacted by Tennessee that allows counselors to refer patients to other counselors who can better meet their goals, which the California State Legislature has judged to be morally reprehensible; andWhereas, California s attempt to influence public policy in our state is akin to Tennessee expressing its disapproval of California s exorbitant taxes, spiraling budget deficits, runaway social welfare programs, and rampant illegal immigration; andWhereas, Tennessee is pleasantly surprised that California will not be sending its economic development teams to Tennessee to recruit our businesses, but we can still send our teams to recruit their businesses; andWhereas, Tennessee is puzzled why California thinks it is a good idea to prohibit its state colleges and universities from participating in athletic competition in Tennessee (March Madness comes to Memphis this year via the South Regional), Kansas, Mississippi, and North Carolina; andWhereas, this type of ban, the result of legitimate disagreements about government policy, is neither persuasive nor productive for either party and will lead to economic warfare among states, as one sovereign entity attempts to tell an equally sovereign entity how to conduct its affairs by restricting travel thereto; andWhereas, the United States Constitution provides for a strong federal government for the common defense, but the Tenth Amendment grants the several states sovereignty in addressing issues solely within their jurisdiction, and all states should respect this most basic precept of American government; andWhereas, if states such as California persist in banning travel to Tennessee as a punitive action for this body conducting its constitutionally mandated duties as its members see fit, our state leaders should consider strong reciprocal action in banning state sponsored travel to those misguided states; now, therefore,BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED TENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we urge and encourage the Governor, the Speaker of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to ban state -sponsored and state funded travel within their respective jurisdictions to any state of the Union that has banned state   sponsored travel to Tennessee in a selective way, so that the other states feel the pain and not TennesseeBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we urge the other forty-eight states to refrain from imposing their unfounded moral judgment on their sister states as California has done in order to prevent escalating foolishness.Oh boy!

THREE RESIGNATIONS AT CNN After Botched Trump-Russia Story…More To Come?,"CNN employees have resigned for their role in pushing fake news about the Trump-Russia story that claimed a member of the Trump transition team was under investigation.Reporter Thomas Frank, editor Eric Lichtblau and executive editor Lex Haris all resigned from their positions following a company-wide investigation into the single-sourced story that was quickly debunked, The Washington Post first reported. CNN quickly followed up with a story of their own on the resignations. Lichtblau reportedly oversaw the false story, while Haris headed up CNN s investigative unit. In the aftermath of the retraction of a story published on CNN.com, CNN has accepted the resignations of the employees involved in the story s publication,  CNN s coverage quotes a company spokesman as saying.The retracted story, which relied upon a single unnamed congressional source, claimed that Senate investigators were probing Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci and whether or not he discussed lifting sanctions during a meeting with a Russia banker just days before Trump s inauguration. CNN later retracted the story and apologized to Scaramucci",politics,"Jun 26, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Jan Schakowsky (Ill.) is married to Robert Creamer, one of the key figures in O Keefe s undercover video that showed him organizing Democrat operatives to incite Trump supporters, hoping to get them to commit acts of violence that could be caught on film, thereby helping Hillary to win the election.Creamer was a convicted felon who oversaw a check-kiting scheme so elaborate that his employees followed a written manual   complete with detailed instructions on when and where to float checks totaling millions of dollars.Go to the 3:35 mark to see Robert Creamer in action:It s only natural that the wife of a disgraced Democrat operative and convicted felon would be asked by CNN to offer hope about the future of the floundering Democrat Party.Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky (Ill.) said Monday that she believes Democrats can win the 25 seats they need to retake the House of Representatives in 2018.Schakowsky s comments on CNN came days after the Democratic Party lost its fourth straight special congressional election, with Jon Ossoff losing to Republican Karen Handel in last Tuesday s House race in Georgia s sixth district.CNN host Poppy Harlow asked Schakowsky about the loss in Georgia, as well as others in Montana, Kansas, and South Carolina. Schakowsky dismissed the losses, arguing they are not indicative of Democrats  electoral chances in 2018. The reason that those Republicans were appointed to the [Trump] administration is because they were considered safe Republican districts. The Ossoff district, the sixth district in Georgia, is the 71st most likely district that Democrats can win,  she said.  In other words, there are 70 districts that will be easier than that. Schakowsky was referring to the fact that the Georgia race and special elections in other states were replacing seats vacated by lawmakers who were nominated to serve in President Donald Trump s administration.

TRUMP WINS! Supreme Court Rules On Travel Ban In Unanimous Decision [VIDEO],"This is gonna be a tough pill for the left to swallow after working so hard to stack the courts In a victory for the Trump administration, the Supreme Court on Monday lifted key components of an injunction against President Trump s proposed ban on travel from six majority-Muslim nations, reinstating much of the policy and promising to hear full arguments as early as this fall.The court s decision means the justices will now wade into the biggest legal controversy of the Trump administration   the president s order temporarily restricting travel, which even Trump has termed a  travel ban. Today s unanimous Supreme Court decision is a clear victory for our national security,  Trump said in a statement.  As President, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm. I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive. He added:  My number one responsibility as Commander in Chief is to keep the American people safe. Today s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation s homeland. The court made clear that a limited version of the policy can be enforced immediately with a full hearing to come in the Fall. An American individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded,  the court wrote.  As to these individuals and entities, we do not disturb the injunction. But when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the United States, for the reasons we have set out, the balance tips in favor of the Government s compelling need to provide for the Nation s security. The justices decided to review the broader constitutional issues over executive authority on immigration with oral arguments to be held in the fall.

JUDGE JEANINE NAILS THE UNHINGED LEFT: “The left’s hate is a danger to us all’ [VIDEO],"Judge Jeanine nailed it tonight describing the unhinged left. She is so right to say the left is a danger to us all. She is especially worried for our President and other leaders in DC. She s so right!PIRRO SAID:  We are now in a danger zone of complete hatred and chaos unlike anything we ve witnessed in American history. The normalization of calling for the assassination, decapitation or the beating of any president is simply shocking. And it is the extension of this hatred that trickles down and motivates people like the shooter of Congressman Scalise. That shooter wasn t crazy. That s too easy. He hated Republicans and thought they should die. I worry, though, and you should all worry for our president and all elected officials  The trickling down of hate is a danger to us all  What s not helping is that the former President and Hillary Clinton are fueling this rhetoric. The bitter Democrats waisted no time in continuing the violent rhetoric almost immediately after Steve Scalise was shot! The ironic thing is that this only damages the Democrats!The Chair of the DNC Tom Perez has been going out giving obscenity laden speeches. He s the leader of the party and he sets the tone.

OOPS! BOTH Bernie Sanders And His Wife Are Under FBI Investigation For Bank Fraud,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and his wife, Jane Sanders have hired prominent defense attorneys, amid an FBI investigation into a loan Jane Sanders obtained to expand Burlington College while she was its president, CBS News confirms.Politico Magazine first reported the Sanders had hired lawyers to defend them in the probe. Sanders top adviser Jeff Weaver told CBS News the couple has sought legal protection over federal agents  allegations from a January 2016 complaint accusing then-President of Burlington College, Ms. Sanders, of distorting donor levels in a 2010 loan application for $10 million from People s United Bank to purchase 33 acres of land for the institution.According to Politico, prosecutors might also be looking into allegations that Sen. Sanders  office inappropriately urged the bank to approve the loan.Heat Street  When Jane O Meara Sanders served as president of Burlington College between 2004 and 2011, she oversaw an aggressive effort to enroll more students and expand the campus to accommodate a bigger student body. Part of that plan: Taking out hefty loans to finance the $10 million purchase of 32 acres of prime property from the Roman Catholic diocese at the end of 2010.But Burlington College soon found itself unable to make its loan payments. The Roman Catholic diocese, which had sold off the land to help pay for a $17 million sexual-abuse settlement, ultimately lost between $1.5 million and $2 million, according to the letter calling for investigation, as well as several Vermont media outlets. The diocese did not respond to a request for an interview. But a source with direct knowledge of the diocese s involvement in the land acquisition says Burlington College almost immediately struggled to meet its obligations. It was within a relatively short time after closing [the deal], they were experiencing financial problems that made it impossible to pay the diocese,  the source says, adding that Burlington soon went into default mode on its loan.Parishioners now say that to secure loans to buy the land, Ms. Sanders misrepresented the amount that had been pledged to the college in its fundraising push.The request for investigation notes that defrauding a bank is a federal crime; it s punishable by up to 30 years in prison and $1 million in fines, according to federal code. Watch Sanders rail against inequality and corruption at his commencement speech to the 2017 graduating class at Brooklyn College: Ms. Sanders  push for the liberal arts college s costly land acquisition was cited in a press release by the college when it shut down in 2016. And as for the claim that Ms. Sanders manipulated the loan application, Weaver  said,  The loan was approved by the financial board at the college. Sen. Sanders, formerly mayor of Burlington, Vermont s largest city, regards the claims as a political game levied against him after his run for president in the 2016 primary election, a platform which has transformed the small-state senator into an influential voice in American liberal politics.

WOW!

Comey for fanning  conspiracy theories  about the U.S. election that  played right into Russia s hands. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has oversight of the FBI, also accused Mr. Comey of working to  shade the truth  by agreeing to the Obama administration s attempt to soft-pedal the criminal probe of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Despite rampant public speculation, Mr. Comey kept hidden the fact that the president wasn t under investigation   allowing conspiracy theories and speculation to run wild, Mr. Grassley said.But Mr. Comey refused, saying later that he had feared saying something he d later have to correct. None of this fiasco had to happen if Mr. Comey had just been transparent with the public, as I urged him to,  Mr. Grassley said. They played right into Russia s hands,  he added.The senator s remarks were striking. A fiercely independent lawmaker, Mr. Grassley has used his office to probe both Democrats and Republicans.He s now in charge of one of the probes on Capitol Hill looking into Mr. Comey s firing and other aspects of the 2016 election brouhaha. We re going to go where the facts take us,  Mr. Grassley said.He said Democrats ended up fostering the very Russian meddling in American democracy that they decried   and he specifically fingered Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, saying the New York Democrat knew from Mr. Comey that Mr. Trump wasn t under investigation but told the public differently.Mr. Grassley said that as a member of the  Gang of Eight    the four high-ranking lawmakers in each party who get the most thorough intelligence briefing   Mr. Schumer knew Mr. Trump wasn t being probed. But Mr. Schumer  told the media that the president was under investigation. And, of course, that further helped feed media hysteria,  Mr. Grassley said. The minority leader even tried to say the Senate shouldn t vote on the Supreme Court nomination because the president was under investigation. And the whole time he knew it wasn t true,  Mr. Grassley said.He said Mr. Comey told him and Sen.

I think we need to know more about that,  Feinstein told host Brianna Keilar on CNN s  State of the Union. And there s only way to know about it, and that s to have the Judiciary Committee take a look at that,  Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said.Comey testified last Thursday that he felt  queasy  after Lynch asked him to characterize his probe into Clinton s emails as a  matter,  rather than an investigation. He told the Senate Intelligence Committee that such a request would match the wording of Clinton s campaign.Feinstein, who is a member of the Senate Intelligence panel, said she would ve also felt queasy. I would have a queasy feeling, too, though, to be candid with you,  the longtime Senate Democrat said.She added that an investigation separate from the ongoing probe into Russian interference in the election is needed. Read more: The Hill Former FBI Director Jim Comey said publicly that Ms. Lynch tried to change the way the investigation into Mrs. Clinton s emails was described. He also hinted at other behavior  which I cannot talk about yet . He was concerned about Lynch s ability to do her job without impartiality. Mr. Comey said that was one reason why he took it upon himself to buck Justice Department tradition and reveal his findings about Mrs. Clinton last year.If anyone had really looked into Lynch s background, they would know she s a big political hack. We were shocked that she was confirmed by the Senate. We felt like she was Eric Holder in a dress. Well, it turned out that we were correct in our assumptions.Read more: WT",politics,"Jun 23, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
“TRIGGERED!” Black Woman Goes Berserk After Spotting Confederate Flag On ‘General Lee’ Car At Event: “This RACIST Car!” [Video],"A black woman went into a fit of rage after she spotted a Confederate Battle Flag on a car at a local festival. Ybia Anderson posted a video of herself confronting a man who brought his  Dukes of Hazzard  inspired  General Lee  car to the Highland Creek Heritage Festival. Here s what she said on her Facebook page:  At this racist-ass Highland Creek Heritage Festival where a car featuring two Confederate flags is being celebrated. This wannabe hillbilly is trying to  educate  me on the Civil War!!! Guess he doesn t realize his side lost!!!  The video is sideways but you ll get the point: Anderson shrieked:  This racist car has not one, but two Confederate flags on it.  The astonished owner of the car attempted to explain but Anderson was just interested in getting the car removed ASAP:  People who look exactly like me and my sons died, were murdered, because of that flag. It has no place here and it is the very first car people see when they walk in.  THE KICKER IN ALL THIS IS THAT IF YOU GO TO MS. ANDERSON S FACEBOOK PAGE, HERE S HER DEPLORABLE PROFILE PHOTO: How heartless is this? The woman who claimed to be so upset at a  racist  car thinks it s ok to make fun of a young white man who was murdered by the North Koreans Really?EVERYONE CAVED TO THIS SHRIEKING BULLY:Of course, the officials of the event caved immediately and gave an apology for having the  racist  car at the festival: Festival Chair Paul Maguire said,  We are very sorry that someone is hurt, it s a family event and there are hundred, thousands who came and had a lot of fun and nobody should be subjected to those triggering moments that just  bring back moments of the worst of human history. If there were a swastika here I would have known right away, that can t be here. Now I know the Confederate flag has the same status. Toronto Mayor John Tory had this pitiful statement to make:  The Confederate flag and what it was represented historically, and represents of a lot of people today, has no place in Toronto.

SHOULD SECRET SERVICE ARREST JOHNNY DEPP For Trump Assassination Comment After Court Docs Show Managers Say He ABUSED HIS WIFE?,"Apparently actor Johnny Depp didn t learn anything from the not-funny  comedian  Kathy Griffin s career-ending attempt at  humor  when she made a gruesome video using a decapitated and bloodied head of  President Trump.  Introducing his 2004 film The Libertine, about a 17th-century poet who notoriously drank himself to an early death, the 54-year-old chose to discuss American politics. I think [Donald] Trump needs help,  he said.  There are a lot of dark places he could go. Here s the video showing Depp s disgusting remarks about assassinating our President:Given Depp s documented history of a violent past and his most recent comments about  an actor  assassinating  a President ; perhaps a visit from the secret service is in order?The Daily Mail is now reporting that Depp s managers knew that the Hollywood actor had allegedly assaulted his ex-wife Amber Heard, court documents reveal.The documents allege that Depp s staff and security were aware he was  extremely volatile  and had  sometimes gotten physical  with his then-wife.His team also claim to have had direct knowledge of an incident where Depp allegedly violently kicked the actress in 2014.The revelations were included in court documents filed this week by Depp s former management group TMG.The Pirates of the Caribbean star is suing TMG for mismanaging his money.In the recent court documents, Depp s former management team claim the allegations of abuse at the hands of the actor are accurate, according to the Hollywood Gossip.The domestic violence allegations first surfaced when Depp and Heard were going through their messy divorce last year.During the high-profile divorce, Heard released a series of text messages   published by ET   that she had exchanged with Depp s assistant that referred to the alleged abuse.At the time, Depp publicly denied that the messages   which mentioned the 2014 kicking encounter   were real.In the recent court filing, TMG appears to confirm the authenticity of the messages. Depp and his long-time assistant publicly denied the messages and outrageously accused Heard of manufacturing them,  one filing states. TMG is informed and believes that Depp knew full well that the text messages were genuine, but pressured and berated his assistant to falsely challenge the texts publicly.

“I’LL BE DAMNED”: Trey Gowdy Outraged That Someone Leaked Intel Chief’s Testimony [Video],"Trey Gowdy is ticked!  About eight hours ago, Adam Schiff and I looked Dan Coats in the eyes and we assured him that there would be no selective leaking of his testimony to us,  Gowdy told  Outfront  host Erin Burnett.  And I ll be damned if eight hours later, there aren t three different leaks with what he told us. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvLM77MP2wgSeveral stories have emerged with reported details of the testimony given by Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in a closed-door session before House investigators.Here s one from NBC:Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats tells House investigators Pres. Trump seemed obsessed with Russia probe https://t.co/v39fPksqlb pic.twitter.com/5pRPvRRYJQ  NBC News (@NBCNews) June 23, 2017Trey Gowdy   who sits on the House Intelligence Committee   sounded irate about the leaked testimony so soon after he and his Democratic counterpart on the committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) promised Coats that what he said in the session would not be made public.About eight hours ago, Adam Schiff and I looked Dan Coats in the eyes and we assured him that there would be no selective leaking of his testimony to us. And I ll be damned if eight hours later, there aren t three different leaks with what he told us.So if anyone is questioning why Congressional investigations aren t taken seriously, and are viewed as political exercises, you need to look no further than the fact that we looked one of our intelligence officials in the eyes and promised him there would be no selective leaking. And here I am being asked about it not even eight hours later.Gowdy believes the leaks could keep other witnesses from being forthcoming in closed-door sessions. You re going to have a chilling effect on other witnesses who want to share classified, sensitive information when it makes its way to the headlines before the transcript s even dry,  Gowdy said.The South Carolina Congressman was asked about whether President Donald Trump s firing of FBI Director James Comey constitutes obstruction of justice. Gowdy replied that he d leave that up to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Congress does not investigate crime,  Gowdy said.  We re not equipped to do it. We re not very good at it.

WOW! TEXAS MAN Pays For AWESOME Billboard Slamming ABC Over Fake Russia-Trump News Coverage,"Americans are sick and tired of being lied to by the media. This awesome patriot and business owner is making sure ABC gets the message!SAN ANTONIO   A Boerne man is making his voice heard loud and clear by renouncing ABC News and recent news coverage of President Donald Trump with a large billboard at I-10 and Buckskin Drive.It reads: ABC News: I grew up with you. We are through. The Russians didn t elect Donald Trump. I did. The billboard was paid for by Kyle Courtney, according to a spokesman with his company Wellstar Groundwater Technologies. Here s what the billboard looks like:Courtney released the following statement to SBG San Antonio. ABC News was the only channel I watched as a child growing up in Texas but I think they have lost touch with America and forgotten the working man. They don t represent our voice anymore. Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign was funded by the Clinton Foundation in close coordination with the media, and now we re seeing them try to fix what they couldn t fix during the election. They are doing everything they can, night after night, to create narratives and sway people s direction to impeach Donald Trump. Our democracy is at stake when a major political party and the media are in bed together. I m not asking anyone to boycott the Democratic party. I m not in the brainwashing business, but the liberal media is. The spokesman said the billboard went up today and will remain up for about two months. He also said Courtney is contemplating whether to keep it up longer and may change the message if it does stay up.According to PR Newswire, Courtney has been in the water well drilling business for more than 30 years and has drilled more than 600 wells in the San Antonio area.

When you look at Johnny s audience, the damage to credibility is catastrophic. This is a legendary movie star who has fallen into complete madness   and everyone can see it,  he told Daily Star Online, exclusively.

NERVOUS NANCY: Pelosi Gives Incoherent Response To Trump’s Saying Her Being Dem Leader Helps GOP,"A nervous Nancy Pelosi responded Thursday to criticism from Democratic colleagues asking her to step down from her leadership post and President Donald Trump s subsequent tweet mocking her for helping Republicans politically.Some Republican members have said that it would be good for their party if Pelosi remains the top Democrat in the House. These remarks followed heavy criticism from Democratic lawmakers of Pelosi s leadership following Tuesday s special election losses in Georgia and South Carolina.Many within the Democratic party are calling for new leadership In other words, Nancy needs to go ASAP!President Trump went on Twitter to mockingly signal his support for the Pelosi:Conservatives like former speaker Newt Gingrich have been saying they hope Nancy Pelosi stays on as Minority Leader of the House She s good for the Republican Party. She s definitely on the hot seat right now but in true Pelosi fashion, she s oblivious to the reality that it s time to go. She even said she s a  master legislator Um, no Check out the transcript of her comments at the press conference: So, you want me to sing my praises? Is that what you re saying? Why should I? Well, I m a   uh   um   master legislator, I am a, uh, strategic, politically astute leader, I am a   uh, uh, my, uh, uh   my leadership is recognized by many around the country and that is why I m able to attract the support that I do, which is essential to our elections, sad to say. I m very pleased at the cooperation we re doing working with all the, um, social media and small donor community to change how we communicate but also how we attract resources, intellectual and financial, uh, to the party. I have experience in winning the congress. When people said to us in  05,  you don t have a chance, be ready for a, uh, permanent Republican majority , I said, Harry Reid and I said,  we don t accept that , so we proceeded, we took the president from 58 to 38, president Bush won the election. But the fact is, they will always make a target. Senator Reid was a target, Senator Daschle was a target, Tip O Neill was a target, I am a target, and they always want to choose our leaders, and usually they go after the most effective leaders because they want to take us   diminish us   uh   the opportunity that we have. We have a Democratic caucus where members participate in the decisions and right now, the members are putting together our messaging as we go forward. I could have written something down on the page and said,  this is what I think , but we don t do things that way, we listen to members, we re very proud of our, uh, policy and communications committee.

DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ Accuses Obama’s DHS Director Jeh Johnson of Lying Under Oath [Video],"Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz dropped a big bomb during an interview on CNN today. She claimed that Jeh Johnson s  testimony about the DNC computer hack is  wrong in every respect  and  utterly misinformed.  Whoa! Who s telling the truth?Schultz told the CNN anchor  He s wrong in every respect. Let me be very clear. At no point during my tenure at the DNC was I contacted by the FBI, DHS, or any government agency, or alerted or made aware that they believed that the Russians, an enemy state, was intruding on our network. In case you missed it, former DHS Director Jeh Johnson testified to lawmakers this week that the DNC rejected his agency s offer to protect its network despite receiving warnings about a computer hack. Instead, the DNC chose an outside cyber security firm to help solve the computer hacks that led to WikiLeaks publishing thousands of its emails.CNN s Bolduan asked Schultz how both accounts could be true:  Secretary Johnson says DNC rebuffed the help offered. You are saying no one contacted you? Schultz replied with a shocking statement:  Secretary Johnson is utterly misinformed. That is simply not accurate. Schultz went further and blamed the FBI for not helping: They left the Russians on our network for more than for almost a year before we discovered that they were there.

It would seem as if the president may have been lying all along about the existence of these tapes. JORDAN REPLIED:  He wasted the country s collective time speculating over whether these tapes existed or not. It s a sad day when you cannot depend on the president s word.

TREY GOWDY ON CROOKED DNC: ‘There May Be Something The DNC Didn’t Want Law Enforcement to See In Hacked Server [Video],"Rep. Trey Gowdy was full of sarcasm (rightfully so) during comments about why the DNC didn t turn over its hacked computer server to authorities. The puzzling thing that raised red flags is that the organization said it never received federal assistance causing people to question whether the DNC had something it  didn t want law enforcement to see. Congressman Gowdy spoke with FOX News  Martha MacCallum about why the DNC did not turn over its server to the DHS or FBI officials who could have helped to prevent future hackings:The DNC was hacked during the 2016 election and  emails were published by WikiLeaks. JKeh Johnson, former DHS Secretary, testified yesterday that the DNC didn t need help after the hacks.Then this shocker after Johnson s testimony,  Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that while she was chair of the DNC, she was never contacted by any federal agency, including DHS and the FBI, about the hack.Gowdy goes on to refer to his career as a prosecutor by implying that it appeared as though the DNC had something to hide: Let me hazard a wild guess: that there may be something else on that server they didn t want law enforcement to see?

CHRIS MATTHEWS CONFUSED About Georgia Election Loss: “I don’t know what the h*ll he was selling” [Video],"MSNBC s Chris Matthews definitely didn t get a tingle up his leg when it came to Democrat Jon Ossoff. Turns out he s confused over what Ossoff was  selling  Matthews said about Ossoff: I don t know what the hell he was selling. He wasn t selling much. Ossoff lost a race that was the most expensive House election ever to Republican Karen Handel on Tuesday night in a race Democrats hoped to turn blue as a sign of national discontent with President Donald Trump. Outside donors from liberal states like California, spent big bucks to win this seat. Donations totaled a whopping $50 million1Ossoff s loss has prompted much soul searching from Democrats, including the left-leaning Matthews.Introducing his panel, Matthews discussed the race, saying that he wasn t even really sure what Ossoff was running on. It seems to me that there was a lot of progressive hype about a guy who wasn t running as a progressive, which is another interesting twist to this,  Matthews said.  He was running on basically, let s get together and be normal or something. I don t know what the hell he was selling. He wasn t selling much,  he said.Further on in the discussion, Matthews made fun of his panelists for the rapidly changing narrative pushed by Democrats in the wake of yet another Democratic defeat. If it went for Ossoff, you would be jumping up and down, saying how great a victory it was, right? Come on, you re smiling. I know you re smiling. I know how people play politics. If you lose,  oh, no, big thing.  if you win,  yay!  I mean, which is it?  Matthews asked.Wow! What an ASS!

CNN ANCHOR DON LEMON: A Republican Winning in Georgia ‘Shouldn’t Be Breaking News’ [Video],"CNN anchor Don Lemon got snarky during reporting on Republican Karen Handel s win in Georgia s 6th District. He made a claim that this is pretty much no big deal. That s funny The Democrats spent 50 million dollars and went all in on this election but are now downplaying or making excuses for the loss. Lemon should do his homework: Donald Trump won the 6th District by slim margins in the 2016 election. This was a HUGE win for Republicans!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hRJS0QWecILemon said,  What s interesting is that, breaking news, a Republican wins in Georgia, it shouldn t be breaking news. This is the way it should happen. But the fact, David, that it was so close, at least it appeared in the polling and in the results, as well. The results are actually really close. He then asked,  What does this say about the state of affairs, especially the Trump   is there a mandate for Donald Trump? Will he keep his support? Will it stay the same? Are Democrats looking at this as necessarily a loss, or they got close and maybe there s hope for them in the midterms?

Host Stephanie Ruhle asked why, in such a close race, Ossoff has not made a greater effort to address his residency outside of the district. Voters just aren t asking me this question,  Ossoff responded. Folks here in Georgia s sixth district care about how their representation is going to impact their daily lives,  he added.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9M5h99tq9c I grew up in this community.

"OBAMA’S GUN-RUNNING, Lying, Race-Baiting AG Is BACK…And You’ll Never Guess Whose Job He’s Reportedly Hoping To Take In 2020 [VIDEO]","Please please please let it be a 3-way race between Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Eric Holder!Former Attorney General Eric Holder spoke in Los Angeles on Monday to promote a bill that some observers say would make California a  sanctuary state,  an appearance that he says is the start of a new phase of his career in which he plans to reenter the world of politics. Up to now, I have been more behind-the-scenes,  Holder told Yahoo News in a new interview published Tuesday, describing his plans.  But that s about to change. Holder, who served as former President Barack Obama s first attorney general, indicated that his goal is to head the legal resistance to President Donald Trump s agenda. But that may just be the tip of the iceberg.Three sources who have spoken to Holder and are familiar with his thinking told Yahoo that he may consider challenging Trump in 2020 for the White House. Now is the time to be more visible,  Holder said.  Now is the time to be heard. I have a certain status as the former attorney general. A certain familiarity as the first African-American attorney general. There s a justified perception that I m close to President Obama,  Holder added.  So I want to use whatever skills I have, whatever notoriety I have, to be effective in opposing things that are, at the end of the day, just bad for the country. Holder was getting paid $25,000 per month to serve as outside counsel to the heavily-Democratic California state legislature to counter the Trump administration. The legislation he supported Monday would prevent state police from helping to enforce immigration law, and Holder traveled across the country to promote it.  WFBEric Holder was one of the most controversial AG s in the history of the United States. He spent most of his first term under investigation while serving as Obama s Attorney General. He was the key figure in the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal with Mexico, and in 2012 Congress voted to hold him in contempt for not turning over documents on the Fast and Furious  gun-walking  scandal. He was also involved in the IRS scandal that targeted conservatives and conservative leaning organizations.Holder also was instrumental in fanning the flames of the Trayvon Martin case in Sanford, Florida. While he was acting as our nation s Attorney General, he was caught by Judicial Watch spending our taxpayer dollars to deploy a little-known unit of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Community Relations Service (CRS)  to Sanford, FL, following the Trayvon Martin shooting to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman. Holder was also present in Ferguson where he did absolutely nothing to stop the rioting and chaos.Watch FOX News  Sean Hannity expose Obama s lying AG when asked about Fast n  Furious while under oath:Here s proof that Eric Holder was lying:",politics,"Jun 20, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

REPORT: “TOXIC” MEGYN KELLY Just Got Bad News From FOX News After Disastrous Start At NBC,"Hello Megyn Kelly! Time for a little karma! Word on the street is that Megyn Kelly will not be  welcomed back  at FOX News even if she comes crawling back from NBC.She s had a rocky start at NBC with her Putin interview and now with the much-hyped Alex Jones interview. You d think the controversy surrounding her contentious interview with Jones would pump up the ratings but it didn t. Perhaps it s because she s become so unlikeable on camera with her snarky questioning and cold as ice demeanor.Even if she comes calling at FOX, it s a no go according to Breitbart news: After Kelly s controversial and much-hyped interview with Alex Jones tanked by again failing to beat out reruns of 60 Minutes and America s Funniest Home Videos, New York radio host Mark Simone tweeted on Monday that NBC is trying to unload Kelly and convince Fox News to take her back.But a high-ranking Fox News source told Breitbart News that there is  no way  Kelly could come back to the network. Quite simply, the source told Breitbart News, Kelly  would not be welcomed back.  Simone also suggested that if Kelly becomes more toxic and her ratings tank even more,  NBC will have to take her off the network,  and  if they are stuck with her, they ll give her an MSNBC show.  Before she bolted to NBC, Kelly anchored The Kelly File on Fox News. During the 2016 election cycle, Kelly won praise from mainstream media journalists when she tried to undercut Donald Trump during the first Republican presidential debate in August of 2015 in Cleveland, Ohio. She also gave  Never Trumpers  a forum on her primetime show to constantly slam Trump throughout the election cycle.And as the Daily Beast s Lloyd Grove noted, Kelly also  hastened Roger Ailes  forced resignation last July with her fateful decision to recount his misconduct to a team of lawyers hired by 21st Century Fox to investigate allegations made in the sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit filed by Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson.  New York magazine s Gabriel Sherman reported that Kelly  told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. As Grove pointed out, Kelly, in her book, said there was some  poetic justice  in the role she played in helping boot Ailes out of Fox News. I worked my tail off  I established myself as a serious person,  Kelly wrote.  I built my own power. And when the allegations against Roger hit, I used it. Perhaps there is some poetic justice in that. NBC reportedly invested nearly $20 million a year to bring Kelly to the network, and NBC s investment has not paid any dividends at all. After her interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kelly was mocked for being way out of her league. And when HuffPost obtained the full unedited interview in which a  nervous  Kelly lobbed Putin  softballs,  Kelly was subjected to another round of criticism.Her interview with Jones did not have any news value and may have damaged NBC s and her reputation more than it helped.You know what they say about KARMA it s a B*tch!Read more: Breitbart News",politics,"Jun 20, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
WOW! TRUMP UNDERESTIMATED ILLEGAL VOTE: New Study Shows Up to 5.7 Million NON-CITIZENS Voted ILLEGALLY In 2008 Obama Election [VIDEO],"President Trump was lambasted by Democrats and their allies in the media when he suggested that up to 3 million illegal aliens likely voted in the 2016 elections.FAKE fact checker SNOPES was quick to discredit his claim without any evidence. They even went as far as to say that cases of voter fraud were extremely rare:FAKE fact checker Politifact gave President Trump s claim of voter fraud a  pants on fire  rating:Fox and Friends host Ainsley Earhardt delivered the disturbing news to viewers this morning that an independent group has claimed up to 5.7 million illegal aliens voted in the 2008 election that gave us President Barack Hussein Obama:As many as 5.7 million illegal immigrants might have voted in the 2008 election, report finds pic.twitter.com/aPfq8MYuSA  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) June 20, 2017A research group in New Jersey has taken a fresh look at postelection polling data and concluded that the number of noncitizens voting illegally in U.S. elections is likely far greater than previous estimates.Watch:Just Facts  conclusions confront both sides in the illegal voting debate: those who say it happens a lot and those who say the problem nonexistent.In one camp, there are groundbreaking studies by professors at Old Dominion University in Virginia who attempted to compile scientifically derived illegal voting numbers using the Harvard data, called the Cooperative Congressional Election Study.On the other side are the professors who conducted the study and contended that  zero  noncitizens of about 18 million adults in the U.S. voted. The liberal mainstream media adopted this position and proclaimed the Old Dominion work was  debunked. The ODU professors, who stand by their work in the face of attacks from the left, concluded that in 2008 as few as 38,000 and as many as 2.8 million noncitizens voted.Mr. Agresti s analysis of the same polling data settled on much higher numbers. He estimated that as many as 7.9 million noncitizens were illegally registered that year and 594,000 to 5.7 million voted.These numbers are more in line with the unverified estimates given by President Trump, who said the number of ballots cast by noncitizens was the reason he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.Last month, the president signed an executive order setting up a commission to try to find on-the-ground truth in illegal voting. Headed by Vice President Mike Pence, the panel also will look at outdated voter lists across the nation with names of dead people and multiple registrants.For 2012, Just Facts said, 3.2 million to 5.6 million noncitizens were registered to vote and 1.2 million to 3.6 million of them voted.Mr. Agresti lays out his reasoning in a series of complicated calculations, which he compares to U.S. Census Bureau figures for noncitizen residents. Polls show noncitizens vote overwhelmingly Democratic.For entire story: Washington Times",politics,"Jun 20, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

FORD’S NEW CEO SNUBS President Trump…Will Build Focus In China…Export To U.S.,"Ford will export the next-generation Focus compact car from China to North America in 2019, rather than from Mexico as earlier planned, saving the company $500 million, a top executive said on Tuesday.It is the first major manufacturing investment decision made by new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett, who succeeded Mark Fields in late May.Discussion about the small-car production shift from Mexico to China began  a couple months ago  under Fields, said Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations.In January, after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Ford for shipping small-car manufacturing to Mexico, Ford said it would kill plans to build a $1.8-billion Focus plant in San Luis Potosi and instead produce the new Focus at an existing plant in Hermosillo.Although it is cheaper to build and ship cars to the United States from Mexico than China,  this was not a variable cost decision,  Hinrichs said in a Tuesday morning briefing. It allows us to free up a lot of capital  because Ford now has to retool only one plant   the existing Focus factory in Chongqing   rather than two to supply North America.Given dwindling overall U.S. demand for small cars such as the Focus,  we thought this was the best balance of that cost/capital tradeoff,  Hinrichs said.He said Ford planned to inform the White House Tuesday.Asked if Ford was concerned about having to pay a border tax, as Trump has threatened on vehicle imports from Mexico, Hinrichs said  the capital saving outweighs the risk  of a potential tax on the Chinese-built Focus.Ford stock fell 0.8 percent at $11.15.  Daily MailHow do you feel about Ford s decision to move manufacturing over to China? Let us know in the comment section below.

RATINGS FOR NBC’S Backstabbing Megyn Kelly Are In…The Anti-Trump Left May Love Her…But Do Viewers?,"Last week, Alex Jones scooped NBC and Megyn Kelly with a secretly recorded conversation he had with Kelly, where she begged him to agree to allow her interview him. Kelly can be heard offering her assurances that she would never disparage him.The controversial Infowars host released the contents of their conversation   which he claims to have recorded   on his website Thursday night. Jones even released a teaser of what appears to be a secretly recorded conversation with Kelly (below).NBC s Megyn Kelly may be getting kudos for the hit job she did on Father s Day for InfoWars host Alex Jones. But the ratings are weak. Even America s Funniest Home Videos and a CBS  60 Minutes  rerun beat her out Sunday night. Lefty Think Progress called it a  ratings catastrophe. Her number: 3.5 million viewers. It s her lowest since her new show Megyn Kelly Tonight began three weeks ago.CNN s Brian Stelter called Jones a  virus. What s different about this, about this hate-monger, this conspiracy theorist?  Stelter asked on Sunday s Reliable Sources.  I wonder if what is different, Charlie, is that the country feels very anxious right now, obviously very divided, as we have been talking about, and Alex Jones is a virus.  There s maybe a fear of spreading that virus more fully on a big network like the National Broadcasting Company. What Kelly shouldn t be praised for are the lies she told Jones in her persuasive ass-kissy story pitch.Before Sunday s program, Jones called her  Medusa  and venomously ranwhat Kelly had to think were private phone calls in which she repeatedly claimed her story would not be a  gotcha  piece.  I don t double-cross,  she insisted. She wanted to get to know HIM. She told him in the end he d be fine with what she did.

LONDON MOSQUE With Links to Terrorists Is Terrorized By Vengeful Londoner [Video],"The mosque in Finsbury Park, London where this morning s tragedy unfolded has been the centre of media attention before. It opened back in the late 80s, as the Muslim population in the area began to grow. Since then it s been one of the biggest prayer halls in Britain. However in the 90s the Mosque was accused of radicalism and its preachers linked to Al-Qaeda.Why was this Mosque allowed to go on with radical teachings after people like the shoe bomber were connected to it. It s time for the politically correct residents of towns like this to call out these Mosques. Notice that Muslims just moved to another Mosque instead of making an effort to oust the radicals within the Mosque.According to BBC,  Finsbury Park Mosque has long been synonymous with the worst fears about Islamist extremism in Britain. The mosque s new leadership have been struggling to reclaim it for the local community   but that struggle raises questions about who runs mosques in Britain. The Finsbury Park Mosque opened in 1988. And with one of the then biggest prayer halls in Britain, many Muslims regarded it as a major milestone,  BBC wrote.  But by the late 1990s, amid the growth of radical Islamism, it had become a meeting place for extreme voices, including that of Abu Hamza. The mosque was visited by  Kamel Bourgass, an Algerian man jailed for the murder of a policeman and an alleged ricin poison plot,  BBC reported.According to the Telegraph,  The Finsbury Park mosque was long known to have served as a clearing house for radical Muslims after Hamza arrived as imam in 1997. His hate-filled rants inspired attendees such as Richard Reid (SEE BELOW), the failed  shoe bomber , Zacarias Moussaoui, one of the 9/11 terror plotters, and Mohammed Sidique Khan, one of the four suicide bombers who blew themselves up on public transport in London on July 7, 2005.

As it turns out, the two women were in period costumes and happen to be tour guides at the historic plantation: A spokesperson for the plantation said,  The plantation employs a diverse range of people of all skin colors for tour guide roles. Even though they wear clothing indicative of the period, the actors who work at the plantation do not try to portray slaves. Get that?

MAJOR OUTDOOR CLOTHING COMPANY With Ties To Human Trafficking Wages War On President Trump Over Outrageous Obama Land Grab,"The CEO of outdoor clothing giant Patagonia is burnishing her anti-Republican bona fides again, this time saying she intends to pledge her entire company to the  resistance  of President Donald Trump.Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario recently attacked President Trump for his statements about rolling back President Obama s unusually aggressive campaign of confiscating millions of acres of state lands and claiming them as  national monuments. We have to fight like hell to keep every inch of public land,  Marcario said in a May article at Huffpost.  I don t have a lot of faith in politics and politicians right now. In an effort to prevent citizens from retaking possession of their state lands, one of her immediate actions will be to sue the Trump administration for its efforts to scale back Obama s unprecedented land grab. A president does not have the authority to rescind a national monument,  Marcario said in an April 26 statement after Trump announced his national monuments order.  An attempt to change the boundaries ignores the review process of cultural and historical characteristics and the public input. In particular, the Trump administration is preparing to revisit Obama s order to create the Bears Ears National Monument. In April, Trump issued an executive order requiring the Department of the Interior to review Obama s actions on national monuments. Ordering Interior Secretary Ray Zinke to review Obama s policies in April, President Trump called Obama s move an  egregious abuse of federal power. Many state governments fully agree with Trump s assessment and were furious when Obama swooped in from Washington and stole away millions of acres of land from state control to create new national monuments and parks.A poll of residents of Utah, for instance, showed that 60 percent opposed Obama s land grab, while only 33 percent supported it.This is far from the first time the sportswear company pledged its profits to political matters. Last year, the California-based company spent over $1 million for a get-out-the-vote campaign to defeat Donald Trump and Republicans.  BreitbartPatagonia is an accredited and founding member of the Fair Labor Association; its website is as much an educational tool about environmental and social responsibility filled with information on issues such as preservation of land in Chile, labeling GMO products, and responsible sourcing as it is an online store. In a note launching the company s food division, Patagonia Provisions, company founder Yvon Chouinard restated the brand s central ethos:  We aim to make the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, and perhaps most important, inspire solutions to the environmental crisis. And yet, despite these aspirations, four years ago internal audits turned up multiple instances of human trafficking, forced labor, and exploitation in Patagonia s supply chain, according to Cara Chacon, the company s director of social and environmental responsibility, and Thuy Nguyen, the manager of supply chain social responsibility and special programs.",politics,"Jun 19, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
MSNBC ANCHOR Makes Sexist Comment That Men Can’t “Stand Up” to Trump [Video],"Liberal hack Mika Brzezinski made a ridiculous claim today that there are no  real men  in the White House who can stand up to President Donald Trump.

BIKERS FOR TRUMP Bring Important Message and Help to Republican Candidate #KarenHandel in HUGE Political Battle,"Millions and millions of dollars from outside the state of Georgia have made their way to the campaign of Democrat challenger Jon Ossoff. The Georgia election has become a referendum on President Trump and could mean a symbolic gotcha moment for Democrats. This is a big deal for both parties! This is kind of like a crown jewel of the Republican Party right now   holding on to this thing.    Chris Cox, Founder of Bikers for TrumpWhile the Dems throw money at their candidate, the Republicans are bringing in the Bikers for Trump to go door to door in Georgia for Republican candidate Karen Handel.This race has gotten pretty ugly with vulgar letters containing white powder sent to Handel s neighbors. The left is really counting on this win but the vitriol only wins votes for Handel.Here s the note put in mailboxes in Handel s neighborhood   LANGUAGE ALERT!Much has been made of the fact that Handel s challenger doesn t even live in the district he s running in!FEAR MONGERING TO GET VOTES:Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) stood in front of 50 Jon Ossoff volunteers at a campaign barbecue and fear mongered to get the message out: The vote is precious and sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have,  he said.  There are some in this country who still seek to deny some of us our right to vote. We can fight back by exercising that right. NOTE TO JOHN LEWIS: NO ONE IS TRYING TO DENY ANYONE S VOTE! MARIETTA, Ga.   This neighborhood might have gotten quite a jolt when Bikers for Trump   sporting tattoos galore, black vests and a massive flag with the group s insignia   showed up in this Atlanta suburb to politely ask people to vote for the Republican candidate in this week s special congressional election.At one stop, Chris Hummel and his wife, Karen, assured Chris Cox, founder of Bikers for Trump, and the six other men and women who were going door to door that they had voted early for the Republican, Karen Handel, over Democrat Jon Ossoff. Mrs. Hummel even shed some tears after learning that three of the bikers had served in the military. Her father served as a battalion leader in the Vietnam War and returned a different man. Years later, when Mrs. Hummel was a baby, he took his own life. We have heard about them,  Mrs. Hummel said about the group.  I just think it is cool that it is just kind of grass-roots door-to-door, just common folks. Because that is really what America is.  Mr. Cox and his crew of volunteers had visited this well-groomed neighborhood before and returned Tuesday to make certain that its heavily Republican voters planned to   or already had   voted for Mrs. Handel. The bikers are hoping to punch a hole in the Democrat-driven storyline that President Trump s supporters are turning their backs on him. For us, it is more about  Support Donald Trump,  and by supporting Karen Handel we are supporting Donald Trump,  said Mr. Cox, standing in a cul-de-sac next to his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and steps away from a miniature soccer goal.  This is kind of like a crown jewel of the Republican Party right now   holding on to this thing.

BREAKING: WATCH TWO PROTESTERS Crash ‘Trump Assassination’ Play in NYC: “Liberal Hate Kills!” [Video],"Awesome! Two protesters crashed the  Trump Assassination  play tonight yelling  Goebbels would be proud!  and  Liberal Hate Kills!  This is the second night protesters have jumped on stage at the Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar where a modern twist shows a President Trump look-a-like assassinated. Lovely, huh?A second protester jumped on stage and yelled but a videographer capturing the moment was tackled by liberal thugs.The videographer was eventually released by the police with the assurance that the police are on their side.In case you missed the first protest on Friday night: Laura Loomer of Rebel Media rushed the stage at the controversial NYC Shakespeare in the Park performance that takes a modern twist on Julius Caesar by playing out an assassination of a President Trump look-alike. Loomer yelled  stop leftist violence  before she was escorted off stage.We re huge fans and hope more people will follow her lead. Can you imagine if the tables were turned and they performed the same play using Obama as the one to be assassinated? The double standard here is unbelievable! You have the blood of Steve Scalise on your hands! The interesting irony is that the liberal crowd screamed and yelled at her. The left loves civil disobedience -except when it spoils their enjoyment of highbrow assassination porn. Do they advocate for violence against our president?They literally have Antifa chants during Julius Caesar before Trump gets assassinated pic.twitter.com/6AbHOChSnC  Jack Posobiec   (@JackPosobiec) June 17, 2017Ms. Loomer was arrested by the the NYPD and was released within hours. Laura s press conference: Jack Posobiec also got up and bravely yelled at the crowd. He yelled  You re all Goebbels In case you don t know:GOEBBELS WAS THE NAZI PROPAGANDA MINISTER:German Nazi Party member Joseph Goebbels became Adolf Hitler s propaganda minister in 1933, which gave him power over all German radio, press, cinema, and theater.In 1925 Goebbels met the party leader Adolf Hitler. In 1926 he was made Gauleiter, or party leader, for the region of Berlin, and in 1927 he founded and became editor of the official National Socialist periodical Der Angriff (The Attack). He was elected to the Reichstag, the German parliament, in 1928. By exploiting mob emotions and by employing all modern methods of propaganda Goebbels helped Hitler into power. His work as a propagandist materially aided Hitler s rise to power in 1933. When Hitler seized power in 1933, Goebbels was appointed Reichsminister for propaganda and national enlightenment. From then until his death, Goebbels used all media of education and communications to further Nazi propagandistic aims, instilling in the Germans the concept of their leader as a veritable god and of their destiny as the rulers of the world. In 1938 he became a member of the Hitler cabinet council. Late in World War II, in 1944, Hitler placed him in charge of total mobilization. As Reichsminister for Propaganda and National Enlightenment, Goebbels was given complete control over radio, press, cinema, and theater; later he also regimented all German culture. Goebbels placed his undeniable intelligence and his brilliant insight into mass psychology entirely at the service of his party. His most virulent propaganda was against the Jews. As a hypnotic orator he was second only to Hitler, and in his staging of mass meetings and parades he was unsurpassed. Utterly cynical, he seems to have believed only in the self-justification of power. He remained loyal to Hitler until the end. On May 1, 1945, as Soviet troops were storming Berlin, Goebbels committed suicide.Via: whale",politics,"Jun 18, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

PRESIDENT TRUMP’S HEARTFELT FATHER’S DAY PROCLAMATION: “Thank the men in our lives who have taken on the responsibility of raising children.”,"President Donald J. Trump Proclaims June 18, 2017, as Father s DayFATHER S DAY, 2017             BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATIONFather s Day is a special occasion that reminds us to pause and thank the men in our lives who have taken on the responsibility of raising children. As sons and daughters, we recognize the love they have given and the sacrifices they have made, and we celebrate the indispensable role fathers play in our lives and communities.Fathers have the ability and responsibility to instill in us core values we carry into adulthood. The examples they set and the lessons they impart about hard work, dedication to family, faith in God, and believing in ourselves establish the moral foundation for success that allows us to live up to our full potential. We remember those fatherly moments big and small throwing a baseball, writing an essay, driving a car, walking down the aisle that have shaped us, and we thank our dads for being there with a helping hand and an open heart.Day in and day out, fathers put their children first, creating loving and supportive environments. Whether by birth, adoption, or foster care, today we honor the incredible fathers in our lives for all they have done and continue to do for us. Fathers inspire us to better ourselves and to be men and women of outstanding character. We recommit ourselves as individuals, families, and communities to promoting and supporting fatherhood, and take this day to express our love and appreciation for fathers across our country.NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 18, 2017, as Father s Day.

"TRUMP’S LAWYER DESTROYS #ChrisWallace In Heated Exchange: “No Chris, I deal with fact and law” [Video]","Let s just get this out of the way Chris Wallace is a flaming liberal and a total a**! He blatantly goes after conservatives with a vengeance but gives liberals a pass. Today was no exception with Wallace trying to grill Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow. Sekulow hammered Wallace in a heated exchange over whether President Trump is being investigated:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_g__BK9Jx0TRANSCRIPT OF THE HEATED EXCHANGE: WALLACE: A look outside the beltway at Erin Hills in Wisconsin, where the world s top golfers are competing in today s final round of the U.S. Open.The investigation into possible links between Russia and Trump associates and whether the president has tried to shut down that probe took some dramatic new turns this week.Joining me now is Jay Sekulow, a member of the president s legal team.Jay, I want to start with the president s tweet Friday that I discussed with Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. Here it is again: I am being investigated for firing the FBI director by the man who told me to fire the FBI director. Witch hunt.Has the special counsel, Robert Mueller, formally notified the president that he is under investigation?JAY SEKULOW, TRUMP LEGAL TEAM: The president has not been notified by anyone that he s under investigation. That tweet, Chris, was in response to The Washington Post story that alleged that five unnamed sources, anonymous sources, leaked to The Washington Post that the president was, in fact, under investigation. So that tweet was in response to that. There s been no notification of an investigation. Nothing s changed since James Comey said the president was not a target or subject of investigation. Nothing s changed.WALLACE: Well, but you don t know that he isn t under investigation now, do you?SEKULOW: Well, no one s notified us that he is. So I   I can t read people s minds, but I can tell you this, we have not been notified that there s an investigation to the president of the United States. So that   nothing has changed in that regard since James Comey s testimony.WALLACE: I   I want to go after another part of this tweet. Why is he going after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. First of all, he seems to imply that Rosenstein is investigating, and that s not true. It Mueller. And, secondly, he made it clear in an interview with NBC that   that he decided to fire Comey well before he ever met with Rod Rosenstein. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP[)TRUMP: I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.TRUMP: He made a recommendation. He s highly respected. A very good guy. Avery smart guy. The Democrats like him. The Republicans like him. he made a recommendation. But regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: I want to ask you a direct question, does the president think that Rod Rosenstein has done anything wrong?SEKULOW: The president has never said anything about Rod Rosenstein doing anything wrong. Here s what   what is the legal situation here. There is a constitutional issue when you have this scenario. The president made a determination based on consult of advice. He decided ultimately. He s the commander in chief. He gets to make that decision that James Comey had a go. That was coming, by the way, from groups right, left, and center over the last year. You   you and I know that. So there had been concern about James Comey.It was put forward in a memorandum   that s what the president s referencing   from the deputy attorney general and the attorney general requesting the removal of James Comey as the FBI director. And, ultimately, that s the president s determination.So here s the constitutional threshold question, Chris. The president takes action based on numerous events, including recommendations from his attorney general and the deputy attorney general s office. He takes the action that they also, by the way, recommended. And now he s being investigated by the Department of Justice because the special counsel under the special counsel relations reports still to the Department of Justice. Not an independent counsel. So he s being investigated for taking the action that the attorney general and deputy attorney general recommended him to take by the agency who recommended the termination. So that s the constitutional threshold question here. That s why, as I said, no investigation  WALLACE: Well, I   what   what   what s the question (INAUDIBLE). I mean you   you stated   you stated some facts. First of all, you ve now said that he is getting investigated after saying that you didn t.SEKULOW: No.WALLACE: You   you just, sir, that he s being  SEKULOW: No, he s not being investigated!WALLACE: You just said that he s being investigated.SEKULOW: No, Chris, I said that the   any   let me be crystal clear so you   you completely understand. We have not received nor are we aware of any investigation of the president of the United States, period.WALLACE: Sir, you just said two times that he s being investigated.SEKULOW: No. The context of the tweet, I just gave you the legal theory, Chris, of how the Constitution works. If, in fact, it was correct that the president was being investigated, he would be investigating for taking action that an agency told him to take. So that is protected under the Constitution as his article one power. That s all I said. So I appreciate you trying to rephrase it, but I m just being really direct with you, Chris. This is   let me be  WALLACE: No, I   I   sir, I didn t rephrase it. The tape will speak   Jay, the tape will speak for itself. You said he is being investigated. And it s not that big  SEKULOW: Chris, he is   just   no, Chris   that s (INAUDIBLE) unfair, Chris.WALLACE: Wait a minute   wait a minute. Jay, and it s not   Jay, it s not just being investigated for firing Comey. There s also the question of what he said to Comey when Comey was still the FBI director. So there s more than just the fact that he fired Comey.SEKULOW: He   Chirrs, let me be clear, you asked me a question about what the president s tweet was regarding the deputy attorney general of the United States. That s what you asked me. And I responded to what that legal theory would be. So I do not appreciate you putting words in my mouth when I ve been crystal clear that the president is not and has not been under investigation. I don t think I can be any clearer than that.WALLACE: Well, you don t know that he s not under investigation again, sir. I mean you might  SEKULOW: You know, I can t read the mind   you re right, Chris, I can t read the minds of the special prosecutor.WALLACE: Well, then, good, OK, so we re in agreement, you don t know whether he s under   you don t know whether he s under investigation.SEKULOW: But I have not been notified. No one has been notified that he is.WALLACE: You don t know whether he s under investigation or not.SEKULOW: Chris, I  WALLACE: The question I m asking you is, does he think that Rod Rosenstein   it s a very simple question   does he think that Rod Rosenstein did anything wrong?SEKULOW: The president has not expressed any opinion about Rod Rosenstein.WALLACE: Does he think that Robert Mueller has done anything wrong?SEKULOW: First of all, he has not said anything about Robert Mueller. And, Chris, let me say something here. You re asking me if I had a conversation, which I have not had, about Robert Mueller with the president of the United States on   or anyone else for that matter. I can t discuss that and would that with you. Unlike James Comey, who leaks information to the press, I actually respect the attorney-client privilege. Apparently he did not.WALLACE: Does the president believe   well, you re speaking for his legal team, so you re out here to represent him and tell us what the president s belief is, is that correct?SEKULOW: No, I m out here to tell you what the facts are and the legal issues are. I m not to tell you what the beliefs are. I m not the client s conscience, I m his lawyer.WALLACE: I understand that and the   and the client   have you spoken the   have you spoken to the president at all?SEKULOW: Yes, but I m not going to discuss those conversations with you. Those are privileged under the attorney-client privilege.WALLACE: Well, I assume that if he asked you to say something, for instance, Marc Kasowitz said all kinds of things about   after Comey s testimony. I assumed he was speaking for the presidentSEKULOW: Marc Kasowitz made a general statement to the press after the testimony of James Comey. That s what that was about. This   you re asking me now questions about what people are thinking in their minds, which I don t read minds, and you re asking me also what I may or may not have had a conversation with the president about and you understand this. I respect the attorney-client privilege, unlike James Comey.WALLACE: Does  SEKULOW: I want to be real clear on that too. I m not going to give you conversations I ve had with   have or have not had with the president of the United States. So when I ve had conversations with the president of the United States  WALLACE: Well, I   your  SEKULOW: As his lawyer, it s privileged, period.WALLACE: Does the president think that Rosenstein, because you talked about this constitutional theory that he took action, that s on the advice  SEKULOW: Yes.WALLACE: Although he says he didn t take it on the advice of Rosenstein, does he think that Rosenstein should recuse himself, and is healing the groundwork to fire Rosenstein and Mueller?SEKULOW: I ve had no conversations and I ve heard nothing without that at all. Nothing. I think this   Chris, this points out   let me tell you one thing quickly about the constitutional theory, as you called it. It s actually called the Constitution. You know, the president has certain (INAUDIBLE) authority under the Constitution. It s  WALLACE: Well, you called it the constitutional theory, sir.SEKULOW: Yes, it is a constitutional theory based on the Constitution.WALLACE: I understand that.SEKULOW: Not so-called. It s the constitutional theory. It s part of the Constitution. The president has inherent authority.Here s what you re trying to   here s what you re trying to do, Chris, and I appreciate that you re   you re trying to push back.WALLACE: Well, now you re reading minds again. Now you re reading minds again.SEKULOW: No, Chris, I deal with fact and law. You were asking me to read people s minds. That I don t do.WALLACE: Well, don t tell me what I m trying to   well, don t tell me what I m trying to do because you don t know what I m trying to do. Actually, what I m trying to get is a straight answer out of you. Let me ask you this  SEKULOW: Yes, well   sure.WALLACE: As a matter of law, does the president think that he can be indicted under the Constitution?SEKULOW: The president   I haven t had that conversation with the president, but the president can t be indicted under the Constitution of the activity alleged in something like this. Of course not.WALLACE: Why is that?SEKULOW: Because there s not an investigation. And there s   there s no (INAUDIBLE) against the president.WALLACE: Well, you don t know whether there s an investigation. Oh, boy, this is weird. You   you don t know that there s   whether there s an investigation. You just told us that.SEKULOW: Chris, you re asking me to speculate   so then what you re asking me to do is to speculate on  WALLACE: And it would matter. I m asking you as a matter of law, not whether there s an investigation. Does the president think he can be indicted as president?SEKULOW: For   for  WALLACE: That s a constitutional issue, isn t it?SEKULOW: For obstruction of justice? No, the Constitution s  WALLACE: No, for any of it.SEKULOW: Now, Chris, you know, let s   let s be realistic here. You know what the   the answer is. Can president be indicted for obstruction? You know what the position has been at the Department of Justice since the 1970s and again stated in 2000. That s not what president   that s now how you engage a president. There s a political process if somebody did something wrong. You re talking about   you re conflating a constitutional process, criminal law, with an issue of political consequence. So I am his lawyer. I m not his political advisor.WALLACE: Senator Dianne Feinstein, a top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, responded to the president s tweet this week with this statement.  The message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesn t apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired.  Is she wrong, sir?SEKULOW: Yes, she s wrong. First of all, Dianne Feinstein also called for an investigation of James Comey and Loretta Lynch for that whole episode regarding her engagement and calling it a, quote,  matter,  not an  investigation.  But with regard to this particular issue, I mean the tweet   there s nothing illegal or inappropriate about the tweet. If the tweet came on the heels of a Washington Post story that had five anonymous sources and didn t even identify the agency from which those sources came from, and that s what he tweet in response to. It s that simple, period.WALLACE: Final question, the president just   just added John Dowd, a high-powered Washington lawyer, to his legal team. Should we expect him to hire other criminal lawyers? And, in a sense, is he preparing for a potential legal battle here?SEKULOW: Look, I mean John Dowd is   is a legal legend, you know that, in   in   in the   in Washington, D.C., and the president is doing the appropriate thing by hiring lawyers necessary, if there was to be an investigation, if there were to be an investigation, you have the lawyers in place. We ve got a great legal team led by Marc Kasowitz. We ve got John Dowd on the team. This is a solid team. Contrary to some of the press reports, a deep team, if necessary.WALLACE: Do you think   I   I   I misspoke. I m going to ask one more question. Because I m not allowed to ask you what the president thinks, do you think that he should stop  SEKULOW: Of course.WALLACE: Do you think he should stop tweeting about this case?SEKULOW: Look, I   here s the thing on that. You know, people have been asking me that. Look, the president has changed the way in which engagement goes in   I mean you ve got great ratings, no doubt about it, Chris. But let s face it, the president speaks to 107 million people through his social media platforms. He revolutionized the election process by utilizing media in a different way. So I   I think, look, the president knows the effectiveness of social media. He s been very effective at it. Again, I m his lawyer, I deal with the issues. Nothing that he s tweeted is causing me any issues whatsoever at this point. Nothing.WALLACE: Jay, thank you. Thanks for coming in.SEKULOW: Thanks, Chris.WALLACE: It s always   it s always interesting to talk to you. Please, come back, and we ll  SEKULOW: Thanks, Chris.WALLACE: We ll continue it and maybe this time we ll get on this   you know what, be here in studio and we can stay on the same wavelength.SEKULOW: There we go.WALLACE: All right, sir  SEKULOW: Happy Father s Day.WALLACE: Happy Father s Day to you too, sir.",politics,"Jun 18, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

This angry shrew is showing just how much she is blinded by hate!ED LUCE: It s very hard to imagine how civility can ensue when people don t even meet each other or live near each other who hold different positions or let their children marry or wish their children to marry people of different views. So that s my concern, there is no public square.FAREED ZAKARIA: Jill, you ve written that you think that while all this is true, this is not a situation where both sides are equally at fault.JILL ABRAMSON: I do think that both sides are not equally at fault, and that there s been a bit of a false equivalency at work, especially in the discussion over the past couple of days. I think that in terms of political leadership right now that both President Trump and the congressional leadership on the Republican side are extremely divisive and that they are really benefiting from a kind of rage machine that operates in this country.This woman must have been in a coma for the past couple of years!Does she NOT remember the horrible attacks on conservatives during the 2016 campaign? Does she not remember the 2016 Inauguration? Oh, how about Berkeley?There are just way too many examples of the left s unhinged violence and rhetoric. From the leaders of the Democrat Party to the George Soros sponsored Antifa thugs, we can say without any hesitation that this woman and all others who refuse to see the problem are seriously delusional and blinded by their hate.",politics,"Jun 18, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"JUDGE JEANINE IS FURIOUS! RINO’s Are Plotting To Take Down President Trump…Cowardly GOP Sitting Back, Watching Democrats ‘Railroad Their President’…Only ONE Republican Is Defending Trump [VIDEO]","Fox News Channel s Jeanine Pirro went after the GOP establishment Saturday on  Justice. Pirro accused the establishment Republicans leaders of watching the Democrats  railroad their president, and then urged them to prove their loyalty by convincing everyone that they are not in on the  effort to take down  President Donald Trump. The Republican establishment not fighting for the commander-in-chief as day after day they watch him being savaged, forcing him to defend himself and run the country. Think about it. If he s knocked out, the succession is clear and things go back to the way they were,  Pirro said. You re in power, damn it!  she later exclaimed.  Do something, pass something, cut this kumbaya crap, put on your big boy pants and act like you re in power, act like you give a damn!

FIRST FAMILY FATHER’S DAY: “Rustic” Camp David with the In-Laws [Video],"Did President Trump visit Camp David this Father s Day weekend to give his Secret Service detail the weekend off? Former President George Bush was known to do the same at Christmas. We know President Trump isn t a huge fan of Camp David calling it  rustic  earlier this year. The First Family waved  to photographers as they left the White House. President Trump looked dapper in a navy suit while Melania wore a $1,795 belted white shirt dress that was belted at the waist.THIS IS A SHOCKER: VOGUE MAGAZINE gave Melania a thumbs up review on her casual style for the trip to Camp David. They described the Gabriella Hearst dress she wore as a softly tailored silhouette  paired with  comfortable shoes.Barron Trump showed off Arsenal Football Club shorts. Barron was seen earlier kicking a soccer ball around on the White House grounds.The First Family joined Melania Trump s parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, for the overnight at Camp David after they accompanied Melania and Barron on their official move to the White House.This is not President Trump s usual getaway spot. He usually goes to his golf club in Bedminster, NJ or Mar a Lago in Palm Beach, Florida for a round of golf and a weekend stay.Camp David has been called  rustic  by the president who favors a more formal setting. His honesty about this government-owned retreat in Maryland s Catoctin Mountains is refreshing and funny. He told the foreign press earlier this year: You know how long you d like it? For about 30 minutes.   Can t you just see the wheels turning for an upgrade to  rustic  Camp David.

"GERMANY: 10,000 Muslims Allegedly Registered To “March Against Terror”…Actual Number Is Much Less, After Largest Taxpayer-Funded Muslim Group Says March Would Send Wrong Message [VIDEO]","After allegedly registering 10,000 Muslims to take place in Germany s  March Against Terror,  the largest Muslim group in Germany refused to show because it would send the wrong message. Say what???A peace march organized by German Muslim groups to condemn terrorism and violence in the name of Islam has been held in Cologne. Organizers had registered 10,000 participants, but actual turnout was much lower.The liberal  The Independent  published a story about the 10,000 Muslims marching for peace before the march ever took place:10,000 Muslims to march against terrorism https://t.co/OC64Es1fRR #NichtMitUns #NotWithUs  Arafatul Islam (@arafatul) June 16, 2017The march, organized by Islamic scholar Lamya Kaddor and peace activist Tarek Mohamad to condemn violence in the name of Islam across the world, was preceded by a heated debate when Germany s biggest Islamic association, the Turkish-Islamic Union (known by its acronym DITIB), refused to take part.  DWTo integration commissioner  zoguz the problem lies in the fact that decision-makers in associations like DITIB have never really settled in Germany,  although for the most part, the members have.In other words, the leaders of the most powerful Muslim group in Germany have no interest in assimilating with Germans, but do have an interest in accepting public funds from German taxpayers to keep their organization up and running.However, DITIB does not seem capable of surviving only off Ankara s support and without help from Germany. After payments to the association were temporarily suspended because of the espionage affair, the money has been flowing into its accounts again. According to the German Ministry of Family Affairs,  It was decided that funding for projects that have already been approved would resume under consideration of all relevant aspects.  DITIB has received around 6 million euros ($6.7 million) in funding from the German government since 2012.Number of participants at Muslim peace march in Cologne were far less than expected.

NO SHAME! MSNBC ANCHOR Attacks Critically Injured Steve Scalise Who Can’t Defend Himself [Video],"Joy Reid is known for her racist slant on the news. She s one bitter and angry woman we ve reported on numerous times for her over-the-top rhetoric. This latest rant is surprising even for Reid. She goes after critically injured congressman Steve Scalise with the aide of a NAACP board member. Steve Scalise cannot defend himself right now The left has no shame!Reid:  There s a whole country out there and a lot of people, at least in my Twitter timeline, and it s a delicate thing, because everybody is wishing the congressman well and hoping that he recovers, but Steve Scalise has a history that we ve all been forced to sort of ignore on race. He did come to leadership after some controversy over attending a white nationalist event, which he says he didn t know what it was. He also co-sponsored a bill to amend the Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. He co-sponsored the House healthcare bill, which as you said would gut healthcare for millions of people including three million children and he cosponsored a bill to repeal the ban on semiautomatic weapons. Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise is still hospitalized in critical condition but liberal MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid didn t let that stop her from portraying Scalise as an extremist just three days after an angry left-winger shot Scalise and tried to assassinate dozens of Republican congressmen in Alexandria, Virginia on Wednesday.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise was in  imminent risk of death  when he was flown to a trauma center Wednesday after being shot during an ambush of a GOP congressional baseball team practicing on a Virginia field. He will be in the hospital for a considerable period of time, presumably weeks,  said Jack Sava, trauma director at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, who spoke Friday about the Louisiana Republican who remains in critical condition at the hospital in the District.Sava added that Scalise  was as critical as you can be when he came in  after a single rifle shot traversed his body from his left hip through internal organs to the other hip as witnesses said he was fielding ground balls.The shot fired at Scalise left perhaps hundreds of bullet fragments internally, many of which may never be removed because surgery might be more dangerous than leaving them in place, Sava said. That circumstance is not uncommon for that type of injury, known as a transpelvic gunshot wound, the trauma surgeon said.Sava said Scalise will require surgeries soon for abdominal and bone injuries, in addition to the two he has undergone to repair a bone in his leg broken by the bullet. The congressman sustained  substantial damage  to organs and blood vessels, Sava said, and remains in intensive care.How can these idiots keep arguing with a man who is critically injured in the hospital? It s horrible because he cannot defend himself!

AWESOME! PRO-TRUMP CROWD Protests Fake News at CNN Headquarters [Video],"Debbie Dooley and a crowd of great Patriots marched in front of the CNN headquarters in Atlanta today in a show of support for President Trump and in protest against CNN s fake news. Who isn t proud of these people literally walking the walk to voice their opposition to the constant drip, drip, drip of propaganda from CNN.Debbie Dooley of Main Street Patriots told Breitbart News why they were protesting CNN today:CNN threw objective journalism out the window once Donald Trump was elected President and have begun to report DNC talking points as news. CNN can no longer claim to be a news organization that reports facts without bias, because they report innuendo with no facts as news with the intent on bringing down a democratically-elected President. They have simply become an entertainment network not to be taken seriously.Time for Trump supporters to get active and show the Democrats that we are very passionate about our support of President Trump and we will fight hard to pass his agenda,  the notice of the event states on Main Street Patriots  website. Bring your signs and let s show CNN that we support President Trump and call them out for becoming an arm of the DNC intent on bringing down President Trump with biased coverage and false innuendos,  the invitation on Main Street Patriots  Facebook page states.A TRUMP SUPPORTER ON WHY SHE S JOINING THE PROTEST:  She is 100% spot on Trump supporter on why she's joining protest against Fake News CNN.

“UNITY” BASEBALL GAME Not So Unified: Democrat Staffers Mock Pre-Game Prayer…Show Vulgar Reactions To Trump’s Unity Speech [Video],"So much for putting a stop to the poisonous debate in Washington. The effort to try and mend fences came to a screeching halt when during President Trump s  Unity Speech  to the baseball crowd congressional staffers jeered and booed. The staffers even exhibited  vulgar gesticulations  at President Trump.The message of unity was lost on these clowns:Washington Times reported:Mr. Trump delivered a message of unity, but some fans in the stands weren t having any of it. One man shouted an expletive at the video screen as Mr. Trump was telling the fans:  We are showing the world we will not be intimidated by threats.  The episode marred what had been a night celebrating those wounded in Wednesday s murderous attack on GOP players practicing for the game. When both teams went to second base   the symbolic spot where Rep. Steve Scalise was wounded in the attack at the Alexandria practice field   to kneel and pray, some mocked the prayer, too. The fans appeared to be Democratic staffers, having booed the announcement of several members of the GOP lineup.Most fans were in the correct mood, however, chanting U-S-A and giving a loud standing ovation to Capitol Police Special Agent David Bailey (pictured below), who along with two other special agents at the field Wednesday were credited with saving the lives of dozens of lawmakers and staffers. Agent Bailey threw out the first pitch. In the wake of the attack Wednesday, leaders in both parties have pleaded for civility in the political conversation.",politics,"Jun 17, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"CONSERVATIVES Who Disrupted Trump Assassination Play Speak Out: “It was like a gang stabbing…I Watched everyone cheering his death, laughing, clapping along…Children in the audience. It made my blood run cold…No better than ISIS” [VIDEO]","Laura Loomer of Rebel Media and citizen journalist Jack Posobiac disrupted the Central Park performance of  Julius Caesar  or more accurately the  Trump Assassination  play last night. At the point where  Julius Caesar,  (who is intentionally made to look like President Trump) is about to be stabbed by a gang of minorities, Loomer rushed the stage and admonished the cast and audience for promoting violence against our current president and against Republicans in general.See video of Rebel Media s Loomer rushing the stage here:Only 3 days ago, an unhinged Democrat opened fire on Republican House members at a baseball practice for a charity game against Democrats Congressmen. Representative Steve Scalise (R-LA) remains in critical condition. Doctors who were in attendance when the married father of 2 arrived at the hospital have now revealed that Scalise was very near to death when he arrived. Democrats like George Soros continue to fund violence against opposing voices, Barack Obama, former AG Loretta Lynch, Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine have all advocated for action and/or violence against Trump supporters.  Liberal professors promote hate and disrespect for anyone with opposing political views and have made their classrooms a hostile environment for students who dare to speak up or speak out against their radical views. Hollywood has come unhinged, and there doesn t appear to a line they won t cross when it comes to promoting violence against Americans who openly support President Trump. The left has shown themselves to be the largest collection of bullies and domestic terrorists this nation has ever seen.At about the 4:30 mark in the video, Laura Loomer, who is a fan of theater recites a Shakespeare line,  Violent delights have violent ends.  She then looks into the camera and calls out Hollywood and the left for the violence against Trump supporters and Republicans,  Just like Shakespeare said; If you re delighting in this violence, this normalized political violence against the right, it s going to have a violent end. Loomer goes on to point out how liberals like Kathy Griffin and the CNN network who glorify those who commit or threaten violence are responsible for this violent atmosphere, and that they re no better than ISIS. Loomer points out the comparisons between the actors on the Central Park stage who are  gang stabbing  President Trump:  I just couldn t help but think to myself:  Wow! When you re holding a knife to someone s throat in the play, and joking about chopping someone s throats off, what makes you any better than ISIS?  Jack Posobiac makes a very interesting point at about the gang stabbing of President Trump:  It was like a gang stabbing. All the people stabbing him were minorities.  Loomer agrees and goes a step further by suggesting the producers were  racists  because they chose all black actors to stab President Trump.Watch:Citizen journalist and author of Gorilla Mindset, Mike Chernovich called on Americans to join him in disrupting the Trump Assassination play 2 days ago:New York!Who wants to go watch the Trump assassination play maybe use some ""free speech"" during the play?https://t.co/64WAPvQjBT pic.twitter.com/7zDQcjNX7y  Mike Cernovich   (@Cernovich) June 15, 2017Twitter followers of Chernovich responded by suggesting they skip the ticket process and instead use the same techniques as leftist agitators, like whistles and drums or bongos and cowbells to disrupt the production.

Laura s press conference: Jack Posobiec also got up and bravely yelled at the crowd. He yelled  You re all Goebbels In case you don t know:GOEBBELS WAS THE NAZI PROPAGANDA MINISTER:German Nazi Party member Joseph Goebbels became Adolf Hitler s propaganda minister in 1933, which gave him power over all German radio, press, cinema, and theater.In 1925 Goebbels met the party leader Adolf Hitler. In 1926 he was made Gauleiter, or party leader, for the region of Berlin, and in 1927 he founded and became editor of the official National Socialist periodical Der Angriff (The Attack). He was elected to the Reichstag, the German parliament, in 1928. By exploiting mob emotions and by employing all modern methods of propaganda Goebbels helped Hitler into power. His work as a propagandist materially aided Hitler s rise to power in 1933. When Hitler seized power in 1933, Goebbels was appointed Reichsminister for propaganda and national enlightenment. From then until his death, Goebbels used all media of education and communications to further Nazi propagandistic aims, instilling in the Germans the concept of their leader as a veritable god and of their destiny as the rulers of the world. In 1938 he became a member of the Hitler cabinet council. Late in World War II, in 1944, Hitler placed him in charge of total mobilization. As Reichsminister for Propaganda and National Enlightenment, Goebbels was given complete control over radio, press, cinema, and theater; later he also regimented all German culture. Goebbels placed his undeniable intelligence and his brilliant insight into mass psychology entirely at the service of his party. His most virulent propaganda was against the Jews. As a hypnotic orator he was second only to Hitler, and in his staging of mass meetings and parades he was unsurpassed. Utterly cynical, he seems to have believed only in the self-justification of power. He remained loyal to Hitler until the end. On May 1, 1945, as Soviet troops were storming Berlin, Goebbels committed suicide.Via: whale",politics,"Jun 16, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO CUBA: Send Back Escaped COP KILLER…Poster Child For Black Lives Matter Movement [VIDEO],"The inspiration behind the  Black Lives Matter  movement   the individual cited by its founder and regularly quoted by its supporters   is a convicted cop killer who is on the FBI s  Most Wanted Terrorists  list.In an article which details the philosophical foundation of  Black Lives Matter , BLM co-founder Garza cites,  Assata s powerful demand in my organizing work. Assata is a reference to Assata Shakur, otherwise known as Joanne Deborah Chesimard, a radical feminist and Marxist revolutionary who escaped from prison in 1979 while serving a life sentence for the murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster.On the night of May 2, 1973, Shakur, along with two other accomplices, killed Foerster execution-style at point-blank range during a routine traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in East Brunswick.For Shakur, the shooting was the culmination of years of militant radicalism during which she joined and left the Black Panther Party because it was not violent enough, before subsequently joining the Black Liberation Army, a domestic terror outfit responsible for bombings and assassinations throughout the 1970 s which claimed the lives of 13 police officers.  InfowarsShe escaped from prison in 1979 and fled to Cuba, where she was granted political asylum, and she s been there ever since.President Trump on Friday demanded that Cuba return notorious New Jersey cop killer Joanne Chesimard to the United States to face justice.During a speech in Miami to announce changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba, Trump said the return of Chesimard and other fugitives was one of several steps the Cuban government needed to take before the longstanding embargo could be lifted. To the Cuban government, I say, put an end to the abuse of dissidents, release the political prisoners, stop jailing innocent people, open yourselves to political and economic freedoms, return the fugitives from American justice, including the return of the cop killer Joanne Chesimard,  aka Assata Shakur Trump said.Following the passing of brutal dictator Fidel Castro, BLM wrote a love note of sorts on Medium, expressing their gratitude for harboring their hero, cop-killer Assata Shakur: A final lesson is that to be a revolutionary, you must strive to live in integrity. As a Black network committed to transformation, we are particularly grateful to Fidel for holding Mama Assata Shakur, who continues to inspire us. We are thankful that he provided a home for Brother Michael Finney Ralph Goodwin, and Charles Hill, asylum to Brother Huey P. Newton, and sanctuary for so many other Black revolutionaries who were being persecuted by the American government during the Black Power era.",politics,"Jun 16, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

"CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST, Author Mike Chernovich Calls On Americans To Join Him In Disrupting TRUMP ASSASSINATION Play In Central Park","The Washington Post [Compost] reports: So far, three major corporate sponsors and the NEA have felt it necessary to distance themselves from the show,  Eustis said in an interview Thursday.  And I feel just heartsick for the NEA. That they re forced to distance themselves from a work of art   oh, my God. Eustis was referring to the statement the National Endowment for the Arts issued Monday, after the Public s production of Shakespeare s storied play came under attack from ultraconservative websites and even from one of the sons of President Trump, who questioned whether it was taxpayer-supported. They targeted the production because of the obvious references it draws to the current president and the depiction in the play of the assassination of its Caesar-as-Trump figure, played by Gregg Henry.Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a message asking if the assassination of his father should be funded by taxpayers: No NEA funds have been awarded to support this summer s Shakespeare in the Park production of  Julius Caesar  and there are no NEA funds supporting the New York State Council on the Arts s grant to Public Theater or its performances,  the NEA declared, in what struck many in the arts world as an extraordinary act of disavowal. It came as two high-profile corporate supporters of Shakespeare in the Park, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America, withdrew financial backing, and a third, American Express, said that its contributions go exclusively to the Public s main theater in downtown Manhattan and it did not condone the interpretation staged in Central Park.Instead of recognizing that the theater group had crossed a line that should not have been crossed, Eustis is willing to take a loss at the box office in order to keep the assassination of President Trump on stage in front of thousands of families in Central Park: As for the Public s future in this climate, Eustis said,  This is damaging for us and we definitely lost money, and nobody likes losing money.

Y is this so funny tho? House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., was shot in the early morning incident at a Washington, D.C., area baseball field. Four others were shot or injured. The gunman was shot and later died.Messages left Thursday with Gentry-Tipton seeking an interview were not immediately returned.Jane Kleeb, chairwoman of the Nebraska Democrats, said the news media s interest in what amounts to an internal party dispute was troubling and distracted from the more important issue of gun violence. Nonetheless, she confirmed that she and the party s central committee were  deeply disappointed  in the comments. Anyone who commits violence against anyone is wrong,  Kleeb said Thursday.  Anyone who makes insensitive comments about gun violence is wrong. For me that s the end of the story. In a separate Facebook post, Gentry-Tipton refused  at this point  to resign.

"TENNESSEE: ARMED FUGITIVES Wanted For Murder Of 2 Prison Guards, One Who Was Working Overtime To Care For Sick Wife, Get Big SURPRISE When BRAVE Armed Citizen Nabs Them [VIDEO]","Feel good story of the day Two escaped inmates sought in the killings of two guards on a Georgia prison bus were captured after a chase and being held at gunpoint by a rural Tennessee homeowner whose vehicle they were trying to steal, authorities said.Donnie Rowe, 43, and Ricky Dubose, 24, were apprehended Thursday in the rural community of Christiana, Tennessee, ending a multi-state manhunt that began Tuesday morning. True bravery is what s caused us to stand before you tonight to talk about a successful capture instead of a tragic incident,  Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn said at a news conference.  So I m totally grateful to everyone involved. Earlier in the day, police in nearby Shelbyville had responded to a call about a home invasion, where a couple had been held captive, Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Nelly Miles said.The suspects fled in the couple s vehicle and fired on sheriff s deputies chasing them on Interstate 24 about 50 miles southeast of Nashville, Tennessee, Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Bill Miller said. Rutherford County Sheriff Michael Fitzhugh said his deputies did not return fire and none of them was injured.Rowe and Dubose crashed the car and bailed out, running into the woods, Miller said. They then came across a home set back on a long driveway.The trooper said the homeowner looked outside and saw the two allegedly trying to steal his car. The man held the two at gunpoint with a neighbor he called for help until the sheriff s department could get there to arrest the fugitives.The two were being held at the Rutherford County jail.Georgia Department of Corrections Commissioner Greg Dozier said in a news release that he was relieved the two inmates were captured and no longer a threat to the public.The two men had been on the run since early Tuesday, when they are accused of having killed Sgt. Christopher Monica and Sgt. Curtis Billue.Watch:The two inmates overpowered and disarmed the guards on a bus about 6:45 a.m. Tuesday as 33 inmates were being driven between prisons, authorities have said. One of them fatally shot both guards, and then they jumped out of the bus and carjacked a driver who happened to pull up behind them on state Highway 16 in Putnam County, southeast of Atlanta, authorities said.The two inmates then fled in the stolen Honda Civic and drove about 25 miles north to Madison, where they ransacked a home, stealing food and clothes and leaving their prison uniforms behind around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday.Late Tuesday night, about 12 hours after the home burglary, the pair stole a Ford pickup truck from a rock quarry about 9 miles from the burglarized home when the trail had gone cold.

GEORGIA REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE’S Neighborhood Blocked Off After Threatening Discovery in Mailboxes: “Your neighbor Karen Handel is a dirty fascist”,"We just reported on the Virginia shooter s message to Karen Handel (see below) and now this. Is anyone going to want to be a candidate for anything if this threatening behavior continues? The left has gotten so dangerous in their rhetoric and their violence. Whoever did this should be punished to the max to set an example for other leftists.Georgia Republican Karen Handel s neighborhood HAS BEEN BLOCKED OFF after reports that letters containing a white powdery substance and calling Handel a  dirty fascist  were left at homes of her neighbors.Police officers have been going from mailbox to mailbox after finding the  suspicious package,  according to local reports, which also indicate that Roswell police continue to flood to the area.The content of the threatening letter, posted below, contains graphic language. Your neighbor Karen Handel is a dirty fascist cunt but I m sure you already knew that,  the letter says, according to a picture.  Take a whiff of the powder and join her in the hospital you Bourgeoisie motherfuckers. RESIST THE FASCIST TAKEOVER!!!!,  it says.   STRING UP THE COLLABORATORS!  The situation is being monitored by local WSB-TV by a helicopter.Handel acknowledged the reports and said her campaign was coordinating with local law enforcement. This afternoon we had some suspicious packages delivered to our house and to our neighbors,  Handel said.  The packages contained threatening letters and a suspicious substance. The police were quickly notified and street is now being blocked off. We will continue to coordinate with law enforcement as necessary. OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON HANDEL S RESPONSE TO THE VIRGINIA SHOOTER:Candidate Handel s Excellent Response to Alexandria Shooter Calling Her A  Republican B**ch PLEASE NOTE THAT HANDEL AND DEMOCRAT JOHN OSOFF ARE IN A BATTLE THAT WILL TAKE PLACE ON JUNE 20TH IN THE 6TH DISTRICT GEORGIA RUNOFF   GET OUT AND VOTE HANDEL!IF YOU WANT TO DONATE TO KAREN HANDEL: DONATE HEREKaren Handel, the Republican candidate for Congress in Georgia s sixth district, on Wednesday afternoon addressed that morning s shooting at a Republican congressional baseball team practice.A gunman who police identified as James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game in Alexandria, Va., wounding five people including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.). Hodgkinson had penned a Facebook rant against Handel last week. My thoughts are with the victims of this morning s despicable, unprovoked attack on the Republican congressional softball team,  wrote Handel, Georgia s former secretary of state.  Representative Scalise is a friend, and my heart goes out to him and his family. Steve and I wish him and the others wounded a speedy recovery. They remain in our thoughts and prayers. I also want to commend the heroic actions of the Capitol Police officers who clearly prevented today s attack from being a much bigger tragedy,  she wrote.Handel also addressed expletive comments that Hodgkinson made about her on social media.Hodgkinson posted an article about Handel to his Facebook, calling her a  Republican Bitch  who wants  People to Work for Slave Wages,  NBC affiliate WXIA reported. Republican Bitch Wants People to Work for Slave Wages, when a Livable Wage is the Only Way to Go! Vote Blue, It s Right for You!  Hodgkinson wrote on Facebook. I am aware that the suspect recently made vile comments about me on social media,  Handel said in her statement.  It also appears that the suspect targeted members of Congress specifically because he disagreed with their views. Hodgkinson s social media posts indicate he was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and loathed President Donald Trump and Republican policies.Handel echoed calls by others, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), for bipartisan unity following the attack. We should not allow our political differences to escalate to violent attacks. We must all refuse to allow the politics of our country to be defined in this way,  she wrote.  Now more than ever, we must unite as a one nation under God. It is incumbent upon all of us to work together in a civil and productive way, even when we disagree.

JUST IN! SURPRISE GUEST Shows Up At Nationals Park To Watch GOP Congressional Baseball Game For Charity [VIDEO],"Shortly after 7 a.m. on Wednesday, the police say, James T. Hodgkinson, of Belleville, Ill., opened fire on a baseball field in Alexandria, Va., just steps from the Y.M.C.A., spraying bullets at members of the Republican congressional team practicing there.Four people were shot in the assault, including Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the majority whip and third-ranking Republican in the House. An ensuing firefight with the police took Mr. Hodgkinson s life.The suspect s brother said Mr. Hodgkinson was a critic of Mr. Trump, upset over last fall s election and intent on bringing his protest to Washington. But his more immediate motive for the attack remained unclear late Wednesday, even as investigators surrounded Mr. Hodgkinson s home on the outskirts of Belleville, a town of 40,000 across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. I know he wasn t happy with the way things were going, the election results and stuff,  his brother, Michael Hodgkinson, said in a phone interview after he received the news on Wednesday.  NYTRepresentative Steve Scalise (R-LA), a husband and father of 2 young children is still listed in critical condition, simply because his political views didn t align with those of the radical Democrat Party to which the shooter belonged.Brave members of the GOP were determined not to allow what happened to stop them from playing in tonight s game.

FATHER OF STUDENT Released From N. Korean Prison Slams Obama…Uses ONE WORD To Describe President Trump That Will Make Liberals Cringe [VIDEO],"Another consequence of weak leadership NYP The father of the American who was recently sent home from North Korea praised the Trump administration on Thursday after his son was released and said the Obama administration s  results speak for themselves. Fred Warmbier spoke to the media about his son Otto s comatose state and imprisonment by the North Korean regime.After thanking Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) for his support and assistance, Warmbier recounted how his son was freed. When Otto was first taken, we were advised by the past administration to take a low profile while they worked to obtain his release,  Warmbier said.  We did so without result. Earlier this year, Cindy and I decided the time for strategic patience was over, and we made a few media appearances and traveled to Washington to meet with Ambassador Joe Yun at the State Department. He said it was his understanding that Ambassador Yun, at the direction of President Donald Trump,  aggressively pursued resolution of the situation. They have our thanks for bringing Otto home,  he said.He described his son s return as bittersweet. Relief that Otto is now home in arms of those who love him and anger that he was so brutally treated for so long,  he said.Warmbier also said he received a phone call from President Trump late Wednesday that he described as  kind. The last thing liberals want to hear the father of Otto Warbmier is that he was grateful for President Trump s help in bringing his son home or that he would describe him as being  kind. WFB   Warmbier had this to say about the North Korean regime at a news conference at Wyoming High School where Otto graduated in 2013 as class salutatorian: They are a pariah regime They re brutal and terroristic. The University of Virginia student returned to Ohio late Tuesday and hospitalized after being detained for 18 months in the Hermit Kingdom after being convicted of stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel.His father said he is stable,  but has suffered a severe neurological injury. Warmbier took questions from the media, including from one reporter who asked more about the Obama administration s handling of Otto s imprisonment. You thanked President Trump and then you also said that the past administration didn t do enough, so do you feel like then-President Obama should have been doing more to help?  the reporter asked.After restating the question for other reporters who could not hear it, Warmbier gave a quick answer. The question was, do I think the past administration could have done more? I think the results speak for themselves,  Warmbier said.Watch:",politics,"Jun 15, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"WATCH NANCY PELOSI Say She’s “Heartbroken Over Death” Of Rep. Steve Scalise, Who’s Still Alive In Hospital [VIDEO]","Nancy Pelosi attempted to offer her (incoherent) thoughts on the Democrat inspired shooting of US Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) that took place yesterday at the hands of 66 yr. old Bernie Sanders supporter and Trump hater in Alexandria, VA. In case anyone hasn t noticed, Nancy seems to be living in an alternate world lately. She s frequently confused and regularly makes nonsensical remarks, but referring to a fellow congressional member who s in critical condition in the hospital as deceased? Really Nancy?Watch:https://twitter.com/joshdcaplan/status/875413158600613889When will Nancy s voters begin to demand she take a competency test or step aside for the good of the nation?Here are just a few of Nancy s latest and best missteps. They would almost be humorous if she wasn t working as a public servant with a great deal of responsibility.On April 26, 2017, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi appeared on Meet the Press and gave a completely incoherent response to a question about the border wall. For the second time in a matter of weeks, progressive leftist Democrat Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi displayed what many believe can only be accredited to having a severe case of  Trump Derangement Syndrome.  While speaking to ABC s Jonathan Karl, Nancy confused the presidency of Donald Trump with George W. Bush for the second time since President Trump s inauguration.During two public appearances in March 2017, Nancy confused Iran with Iraq, pronounced words strangely, and claimed Republicans are offering a  Mini Me  or  Mickey Mouse  budget. Ends her very strange press conference by saying,  I don t know. But there s no  there there .  We re beginning to wonder if Nancy is still  there ?Is Nancy so flustered and panicked by Trump s presidency and her diminished role in Congress that she is no longer able to speak in public? Or, is it possible (all kidding aside) that she needs to be examined by a medical professional?You be the judge ",politics,"Jun 15, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
UNHINGED PELOSI: It’s “Outrageous” That Republicans Blame Dems for Shooting: “Somewhere in the 90’s the Republicans went on the politics of personal destruction” [Video],"Well, that didn t take long Nancy Pelosi went on a unhinged angry rant at Republicans for blaming yesterday s shooting on left-wing rhetoric. While she doesn t say it s appropriate to talk about she goes on to rant at Republicans for any comment blaming Democrats: Somewhere in the 90 s the Republicans went on the politics of personal destruction Here s the second part of Pelosi s ridiculous response:The gunman who shot Steve Scalise was a strong political supporter of Bernie Sanders. He had a Facebook page and twitter account full of hate for Republicans and President Trump. Anyone with half a brain would know this man committed this heinous crime for political reasons. Nancy Pelosi acts innocent in all this hate and political terrorism when she was just recorded laughing at the California DNC Chair flipping off President Trump and saying,  F*ck Trump! : A reporter asked:  Can you comment on the possibility that this incident could be used against Democrats or the Democratic Party politically because the assailant was apparently motivated by some kind of anti-Republican sentiment and we have heard comments from Republicans, including Congress, about vitriol rhetoric from the left being in some way to blame? Pelosi responded with the most idiotic comment: The comments made by my Republican colleagues are outrageous. Beneath of the dignity of the job they hold, beneath the dignity of the respect we would like Congress to command. How dare they say such a thing. How dare they Pelosi went on to point out the past rhetoric that came from Republicans, including President Donald Trump. Probably as we sit here, they re running caricatures of me and Georgia once again of over $100 million, of vitriolic things they say that resulted in calls to my home constantly, threats in front of my grandchildren really predicated on their comments and their paid ads,  Pelosi said. So this sick individual does something despicable, and it was horrible what he did, hateful, but for them to all of a sudden be sanctimonious as if they ve never seen such a thing before  and I don t even want to go into the president of the United States. But in terms of some of the language that he has used  So, again, let s go there another day.

A MUST WATCH! Mark Steyn Calls Out Political Violence On The Left: “They’ve got to own this!” [Video],"Mark Steyn was on fire last night! If you were lucky enough to hear his brilliant take on the left, you know he hit it out of the park with his commentary. Note that it gets really good in the last minute. He s awesome!STEYN DISCUSSED THE  DEHUMANIZING  OF YOUR OPPOSITION IN A SPECIAL OP-ED ABOUT THE POISONING OF ROBERT SPENCER: The Poisoning of Robert Spencer,  by Mark Steyn, May 18, 2017:For years now I ve said that anti-free-speech leftists and the men who slaughtered the staff of Charlie Hebdo, shot up Lars Vilks  event in Copenhagen, etc, are merely different points on the same continuum: They re both in the shut-up business: both groups find it quicker and easier and more satisfying to silence you than to debate you.There were those who found the comparison offensive   to whom I would on good-humored days grant that the two points on the same continuum were nevertheless some distance apart.Well, they got considerably closer in Reykjavik last week.Robert Spencer, the author of several bestselling books on Islam, a brave crusader against the dopier multiculti illusions and the proprietor of the indispensable Jihad Watch, gave a speech at the Grand Hotel, went to unwind at dinner afterwards, and was poisoned by a social-justice warrior. Here s Robert s account of what happened That s quite a sophisticated operation   a two-man team, the first a fake fan, the second a post-kiss-of-death gloater.Before the banking crash of  08, Iceland was flush, and celebs like Elton John were flown in for gala bashes. But it s all quietened down a bit since then, so the Spencer event was a big deal. He drew an audience of 500   which in a town of 125,000 and a nation of 300,000 is pretty impressive. There was lots of coverage of his visit   none of which actually quoted him or excerpted his speech or interviewed those who were interested in hearing what he had to say. Instead the media preferred to cover the few dozen protestors of his trip. In all the column inches devoted to Robert Spencer, no journalist thought to seek a comment from Robert Spencer. There are two sides to every story   except this guy s story: he doesn t deserve a side.This kind of dehumanization sends a message   and the man who poisoned Robert got it loud and clear:Those who paint the targets, and those who shoot at them, think they re doing something great. Not only does the Left fill those whom it brainwashes with hate, but it does so while portraying its enemies as the hatemongers, such that violent Leftists such as the young man who drugged me feel righteous as they victimize and brutalize for the crime of disagreement.I have no doubt whatsoever that whoever poisoned me in Iceland went away feeling happy over what he had done. If he told anyone what he did, I m sure he was hailed as a hero. I m also aware that many who read this will crow and exult in knowing that someone who hates my opposition to jihad terror and Sharia oppression made me seriously ill. This is how degenerate and evil the Left has become.I don t know how I d stand up to a cocktail of Ritalin and Ecstasy. I do know there s at least one person in my modest entourage it would kill. And I have no doubt that had the fellow in the restaurant switched on the radio the following morning and heard that Robert Spencer had died in hospital overnight he would have celebrated.Like the guns at Singapore, the social-justice mob s fingers are pointing in the wrong direction: They accuse their opponents endlessly of  otherization ; yet they are the ones who so deny the humanity of  the other  that it seems cool and heroic to attempt to kill a chap who gave a speech you object to   even though you never heard the speech, and, even if you had, are incapable of articulating what exactly in it you take issue with.Douglas Murray and I noted after the tenth anniversary of the Mohammed cartoons how strangely controversial the post-event dinner has become. In Copenhagen, the restaurant panicked at the sight of the PET   the Danish security-service agents   and canceled our booking. As Douglas wrote:Ten years ago, you could publish depictions of Mohammed in a Danish newspaper. Ten years later, it is hard for anyone who has been connected with such an act to find a restaurant in Copenhagen that will serve them dinner.For those in Robert Spencer s line of work, these events are undeniably stressful. There are security precautions, of course, but you never know, from the Vilks event in Copenhagen to Robert s in Garland, Texas, whether some jihadist will succeed in breaking through. There s a sense of relief when you exit the stage and it s all gone off without incident. You re looking forward to a drink and a bite to eat in convivial company. And you re on your post-performance high, so you re generally bonhomous when people approach professing to be fans and seeking a selfie or an autograph. And there s three or four and they re all around you, and you put your drink down on the table   as Douglas and I did again and again in the bar we wound up in late that night. And the fans move on, and you pick up your glass without a thought Robert Spencer will never do that again.The social-justice crowd are moving toward the same point as the Charlie Hebdo killers, and for the same reason: They re too stupid to argue. For the Islamic imperialists, debate is a largely alien concept. For the left, it s simply too much effort. As I said here many years ago, the great appeal of multiculturalism is that it absolves you from having to know anything about other cultures: If they re all equally valid, what s the point? Slap on the CO-EXIST bumper sticker and off you tootle. No need to worry whether the  C  might have a bit of a problem with some of the other letters, and that indeed, if not for the  C , you wouldn t need a bumper-sticker admonition to CO-EXIST in the first place. But, after two generations of social engineering, of the substitution of attitudes for education, it would require too much effort to equip yourself to argue against the difficult questions a man such as Robert Spencer raises. It s literally easier to kill him.Not yet in the blood-lusting exultant scimitar-raising style of the decapitators of French priests. But just through whatever you ve got in your stash that might ensure he ll be flying out of Reykjavik by the handles. So for the moment there is still a continuum. But it s narrowing, and will narrow still.Get well soon, Robert.",politics,"Jun 15, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Something that made him mad at the world so he focused on Republicans. He did understand inequality as an issue. Bernie Sanders wrote about that in the paper the other day. There s nothing wrong with the issue. It s a great issue to fight for if you re a progressive. But he got it into his head that he was going to get better equality of incomes in this country by killing people. That s not going to happen.

SIX PROMINENT DEMOCRATS WHO CALLED FOR VIOLENCE Against Americans That Don’t Agree With Their Politics [VIDEO],"Today s act of terror against a GOP Congressional baseball team by a Bernie Sanders supporter was about as ugly and hateful as anyone could imagine. But no one should be surprised by this violent act, given how many leaders in the Democrat Party have been calling for violence against anyone who disagrees with their radical progressive agenda, starting with our former president and community organizer, Barack Obama. Below, is a list of 6 prominent Democrats who have called for violence against Americans who disagree with them. Of course, their actions have largely been ignored and deemed acceptable behavior by their allies in the mainstream media #1. President Obama s grassroots Organizing for Action, in a message to supporters, said that voters turned their back on them and it is time respond by fighting  harder than we ever have before. That Barack Obama would suggest Democrats fight harder than ever before should come as no surprise to anyone who s been paying attention. The former president and community organizer is no stranger to calling for violence against anyone who doesn t agree with him.In 2008, he made a comment about rubbing out his opponents the  Chicago way  when he suggested  If they [Republicans] bring a knife to the fight, we [Democrats] bring a gun. Obama also joked about rubbing out his opponents #TheChicagoWay:""If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun,  #Obama, Philly, 2008  John Kass (@John_Kass) August 10, 2016Here s a video highlighting some of our former community organizer in chief s violent comments:Scrapping any intention to work with the new administration, the message from OFA s BarackObama.com said,  we re not backing down. The email to supporters was a clear rallying cry to fight the incoming Trump administration, despite Obama s pledge to help the new team.OFA s Jeremy Bird said,  If you re anything like me, you re still sorting through the events of the past week and a half. It s hard   there s no way to sugarcoat that. Vulnerable communities are feeling like this country has turned its back on them. And years of hard work are on the chopping block, seemingly overnight. Maybe you re feeling disillusioned, cynical, or frustrated. But now is not the time to walk away   now is the time to get in the ring and fight harder than we ever have before. Washington Examiner#2. Hillary Clinton s former running mate Tim Kaine called for Democrats to  fight in the streets against Trump. Kaine, whose son was recently charged for his involvement in a riot during a pro-Trump event, had appeared on MSNBC in January, calling for members of his party to  fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box. Kaine s 24-year-old  son Linwood Kaine was charged in May with  fleeing police on foot, concealing his identity in a public place, and obstructing legal process,  after a masked group he was with threw smoke bombs into a pro-Trump rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota in March.#2. Former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch posted a video urging people to march, bleed, and die in the streets.In February, Obama s attorney general posted a video in which she urged people to march and bleed in the streets to resist the president and his administration. It has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference. They ve marched, they ve bled and yes, some of them died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before. We can do this again,  Lynch stated.#3. Hillary Clinton made a video where she told Democrats to  RESIST and to  stay engaged  through activism. She praised the people who were marching and protesting against anyone who doesn t agree with their progressive agenda.  Let resistance plus persistence equal progress for our party and for our country.  Clinton wrapped up her video by telling Democrats to,  Keep fighting! Watch:#4. Madonna tells women s march that she fantasizes about blowing up the White House.During the unhinged aging pop star s vulgar speech at the rally, she demanded that this was  the beginning of a revolution,  and called Trump s win a  horrific moment of darkness. Yes, I m angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House,  Madonna said.  But I know that this won t change anything. We cannot fall into despair.  -Big League Politics#5.  Comedian  Kathy Griffin made a career-ending decision to hold an ISIS inspired bloodied, decapitated head of President Trump up for a video, as part of a  comedy act . No one but Kathy and some hate-filled Democrats thought it was funny:#6. Three weeks before President Trump s inauguration, another unhinged  comedian  Rosie O Donnell tweeted:   DONALD TRUMP IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE.  She added,  LESS THAN 3 WEEKS TO STOP HIM AMERICA. Stop him?  Was Rosie calling for someone to harm or to  take out  Donald Trump before his inauguration? It sure sounds like it to us!",politics,"Jun 14, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"FLASHBACK: KEY DEMOCRATS Call for Violence in the Streets…”March, Bleed, Die” [Video]","And we wonder why violence like today s shooting happened The left started with the violence during the 2016 and continued to escalate it once they lost. We have key Democrats calling for violent resistance in the streets Sick!Can anyone imagine a sitting Republican Senator calling for violence or fighting in the streets in opposition to a newly elected Democratic President? Speaking of p*ssies On Tuesday Democratic Senator Time Kaine told the Morning Joe in an interview that Democrats need to fight the Trump administration including online and on the streets in addition to the at the ballot box.Partial Transcript:MIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST  MORNING JOE : So, broad question about the future of the Democratic Party, especially given your firsthand experience with what we ve all been through. There s so much going on here that we clearly see, you know, places where you   we can criticize what the administration is doing, but how does the party rebuild? How do you prevent overreach in a situation like this? How do you prevent a continuation of the bubble in a situation like this, and how does the party reclaim its reach across the country while fighting these battles? SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): So, the way we get outside the bubble is we take advantage of this tremendous public outcry against the administration. What we ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there s the momentum to be able to do this. And we re not afraid of the popular outcry, we re energized by it and that s going to help us do our job and do it better.  -GPListen to faux man Tim Kaine call for fighting on the streets here. Pay special attention to his comment about the  Women s March  that  was organized under a grassroots  label.'  It sounds like Kaine s admitting that it was organized under a grassroots  label  but that it wasn t really grassroots at all. Why didn t he just come out and admit that it was organized by Soros, Obama and Planned Parenthood?Obama s former AG Loretta Lynch released a video that s a call to action for Democrats. These people who have been stripped of power after being so close to achieving their goals of fundamentally transforming America into something most Americans wouldn t recognize, are serious about starting a civil war in our nation. If you don t believe me, listen to the words of Obama s former AG, who compares the fight against President Trump and his supporters to that of the Civil War:  I know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people. I know it s a time of concern for people, who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on and even being rolled back. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our Founding Fathers. (Lynch s statement about the Founding Fathers is quite ironic, considering that she worked hand-in-hand with former President Barack Obama to destroy the very fabric of our Constitution.) It has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference. They ve marched, they ve bled and yes, some of them died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before. We can do this again. We could also add the DNC s California Chair: In a sign of the vigor of the party s distaste for the president, outgoing party Chair John Burton, a longtime Democratic lawmaker and powerbroker known for his blunt and profane manner, extended two middle fingers in the air as the crowd cheered and joined him. F  Donald Trump,  he said:Outgoing @ca_dem chair @Johnburton gets standing O w final words to his party, finger upraised:  F@ck Donald Trump!  pic.twitter.com/VIqNQlhDJc  Carla Marinucci (@cmarinucci) May 20, 2017And we thought Tom Perez was bad: Tom Perez must not have taken the class about winning friends and influencing people. How can you win over voters with such bitterness and anger? The Democrat Party has sunk to a new low with this classless thug. Who goes out there and speaks like this? We reported (see below) on the last speech Perez gave and he said the same nasty things. What gives? Are the deems so desperate that they re now resorting to profanity-filled speeches that make false claims about Republicans and President Trump?

Candidate Handel’s Excellent Response to Alexandria Shooter Calling Her A ‘Republican B**ch’," We should not allow our political differences to escalate to violent attacks. We must all refuse to allow the politics of our country to be defined in this way,  she wrote.  Now more than ever, we must unite as a one nation under God. It is incumbent upon all of us to work together in a civil and productive way, even when we disagree.    Georgia Congressional Candidate Karen HandelPLEASE NOTE THAT HANDEL AND DEMOCRAT JOHN OSOFF ARE IN A BATTLE THAT WILL TAKE PLACE ON JUNE 20TH IN THE 6TH DISTRICT GEORGIA RUNOFF   GET OUT AND VOTE HANDEL!IF YOU WANT TO DONATE TO KAREN HANDEL: DONATE HEREKaren Handel, the Republican candidate for Congress in Georgia s sixth district, on Wednesday afternoon addressed that morning s shooting at a Republican congressional baseball team practice.A gunman who police identified as James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game in Alexandria, Va., wounding five people including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.). Hodgkinson had penned a Facebook rant against Handel last week. My thoughts are with the victims of this morning s despicable, unprovoked attack on the Republican congressional softball team,  wrote Handel, Georgia s former secretary of state.  Representative Scalise is a friend, and my heart goes out to him and his family. Steve and I wish him and the others wounded a speedy recovery. They remain in our thoughts and prayers. I also want to commend the heroic actions of the Capitol Police officers who clearly prevented today s attack from being a much bigger tragedy,  she wrote.Handel also addressed expletive comments that Hodgkinson made about her on social media.Hodgkinson posted an article about Handel to his Facebook, calling her a  Republican Bitch  who wants  People to Work for Slave Wages,  NBC affiliate WXIA reported. Republican Bitch Wants People to Work for Slave Wages, when a Livable Wage is the Only Way to Go! Vote Blue, It s Right for You!  Hodgkinson wrote on Facebook. I am aware that the suspect recently made vile comments about me on social media,  Handel said in her statement.  It also appears that the suspect targeted members of Congress specifically because he disagreed with their views. Hodgkinson s social media posts indicate he was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and loathed President Donald Trump and Republican policies.Handel echoed calls by others, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), for bipartisan unity following the attack. We should not allow our political differences to escalate to violent attacks. We must all refuse to allow the politics of our country to be defined in this way,  she wrote.  Now more than ever, we must unite as a one nation under God. It is incumbent upon all of us to work together in a civil and productive way, even when we disagree.

SHOCKING RAW VIDEO OF ALEXANDRIA SHOOTING: Witness Takes Video with Phone [Video],"Noah Nathan was with his two dogs in an adjacent dog park when shots rang out this morning at an Alexandria, VA baseball field. The dramatic video from the shooting in Alexandria, captured by Nathan shows some of the chaos that ensued when a 66-year-old left-wing nut job opened fire on the GOP congressional team: In the dog park, Noah Nathan clutched two leashes. He watched bullets ricochet off a dirt path beyond the right field fence. He heard a cry go up from the players left on the field, directed toward the security guards who were swinging into action.More than 25 bullets can be heard ripping through the air in the footage, which was captured by a witness close to the field at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park.At one point, a man can be seen lying in the middle of the field. Do we know where he s at?  the man recording the video can be heard saying.  I assume people have been calling 911 already. The shooting continues for several minutes, with some pauses in between the gunfire. Toward the end of the video, several gunshots are fired in quick succession, as people shout in the background.The footage then shows several people crowd around the player on the field.The shooter has died and it s being reported he was homeless living out of a gym bag. It s also being reported he planned this attack for weeks.Read more: NYP",politics,"Jun 14, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

He eventually corrected himself to say that it s just 93 people a day who are victims of gun violence. How many are saved BECAUSE they are armed with a gun? Lives were saved today because the Capitol Police were armed. That s all thanks to Steve Scalise who is a leader in Congress and gets protection. It they hadn t been there, who know how many would have been killed!McAuliffe is a Clinton crony who has always been a snake in the grass. He will do anything to get ahead politically.

LOL! GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS Win NBA Title…Former “Sports Network” ESPN Obsesses Over Whether Or Not They’ll Visit White House [VIDEO],"Remember when the first question reporters asked players after winning a national championship went something like this:   Now that you ve reached the pinnacle of your career, where are you going?  to which the player would reply,  I m going to Disneyworld!  Since ESPN has become more of a liberal propaganda network than an actual sports network, their question has changed to asking about whether or not the players will dare to visit the White House, where the one man who liberals fear most currently resides.ESPN s obsession with President Trump is embarrassing. Instead of reporting about sports, they d rather report about how many crybaby, multi-millionaire athletes don t like our President and may choose to stay home in their safe-spaces as opposed to visiting the democratically elected President of the greatest country in the world. To put this in perspective, in less than 24 hours after winning the NBA championship, ESPN s senior NBA writer, The Undefeated s Marc Spears obsessed over whether or not the Golden State Warrior team would visit the White House. Seriously? After winning the coveted NBA championship, that s what basketball fans are supposed to care about? Did anyone at ESPN even consider that about 99.9% of their target market couldn t care less about their leftist political propaganda, and they actually want read their articles or tune in to their shows because they re interested in SPORTS?From ESPN article titled:The reigning champion Golden State Warriors addressed speculation about whether they will make the traditional visit to the White House, saying they  will make those decisions when and if necessary. Today is all about celebrating our championship,  the team said in a statement Tuesday.  We have not received an invitation to the White House, but will make those decisions when and if necessary. Shortly before the team issued its statement, Warriors owner Joe Lacob was asked about a potential White House visit during an interview with ESPN s First Take. I can t believe we re getting this question already,  Lacob said.  But honestly, that s something we ll worry about at the time. That s a long time from now. Questions about the Warriors  plans for a trip to Washington, D.C., arose just hours after they won their second NBA title in the last three years, when a CNBC analyst tweeted that the team unanimously decided to skip the White House visit.Most of the Warriors, in the immediate aftermath of their Game 5 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, have not publicly commented on whether they will make the trip.Veteran forward David West, who has been outspoken in his disapproval of President Donald Trump, told The Undefeated s Marc Spears on Monday night that he  probably  will decline the opportunity. I don t know. I probably won t,  West said.  But I m going to enjoy this. They re going to have to get me down from this cloud. I can t describe it. Warriors coach Steve Kerr expressed his disappointment with the election results last November, saying after the election that Trump regularly used  racist, misogynist, insulting words  during his campaign.

HUNGARY’S BADASS PRIME MINISTER Responds To Threats From EU…And His Response Is Making Everyone Want To Stand Up And Cheer!

Schulz shot back swiftly at Orb n in his speech on Tuesday.His comments came as the European Commission voted to launch infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary for not taking in refugees under a mandatory 2015 quota system advocated by Germany that aimed to relocate 160,000 refugees across the Continent.Hungary s badass Prime Minister Viktor Orb n has consistently stood up to leftist EU bullies who are demanding that all EU nations take their  fair share  of the mass influx of mostly Muslim refugees. We shall not allow others to tell us whom we can let into our home and country, whom we can live alongside.   Prime Minister Viktor Orb nWatch Prime Minister Viktor Orb n s historic speech in March, 2016, where he demands other European leaders find their backbone and save Europe before it s too late. His speech will make you want to stand up and cheer! Mr.Orb n says  That s a German problem,  Schulz said.  Let me make this perfectly clear: When it comes to agricultural policy, it s all  Yes, please.  When it comes to subsidies, it s all  Yes, please.  And when it comes to solidarity in refugee policy, it s  No, thank you   that s not acceptable.

TILLERSON SLAMS BIDEN COMMENT: ‘Show Me Your Results and I’ll Tell You Your Commitment’,"WE LOVE HIS STYLE! Secretary of State Rex Tillerson slammed a comment from former Vice President Joe Biden about how budgets reflect priorities:  Don t tell me what you value; show me your budget and I ll tell you what you value,  Biden had said. Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) mentioned Biden s quote during Tuesday s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing with Tillerson. Coons used the quote to reference the Trump administration s proposed funding cuts to the State Department s budget. Tillerson said that results gauged values more than funding. Amen!Coons was basically using a quote from Biden to push the notion that the State Department isn t spending enough money. Notice how Coons is also unhappy with not spending or hiring fast enough at the State Department. He doesn t get that the Trump administration is results oriented and not funds oriented. Secretary Tillerson continued:  Having the funds are certainly appreciated and needed, but then we have to be able to deliver working with other aid agencies and working with the situation on the ground to have the aid reach those most in need,  he said.Tillerson said in order to effectively solve international aid issues, the State Department must look at the results desired before calculating how much money is necessary to do so. He highlighted that it was irresponsible to just throw money at the problem. The statement that  show me your funding and I ll show you your level of commitment,  I do not agree with.

"LOL! WHOOPI GOLDBERG Caught Telling HUGE LIE During Interview With Newt Gingrich, As The View Hacks Tried To Prove President Trump’s a “Liar” [VIDEO]","Newt Gingrich was promoting his new book  Understanding Trump  on The View today. The leftist hacks of the The View took advantage of his appearance to play  gotcha,  as they attempted to find ways to coerce a confession out of Newt that President Trump is a  liar.  Newt wasn t falling for it however. While many of us would have preferred to see Gingrich take off the gloves with the hosts of The View, he chose instead to sit back and sling a few arrows on an  as needed  basis.The not-funny comedian Joy Behar attempted to paint Trump as a serial  liar  and was surprised when Gingrich shot back with, You mean like  you can keep your doctor, you can keep your insurance ? You want to talk about lies by a president?  Behar responded by attempting to convince Gingrich that Barack Obama didn t lie when he told one of his most famous lies to the American people, and that it was simply a  misjudgment  on his part.Near the end of the interview, Whoopi Goldberg went through a list of questions she used to vet Gingrich and prove how credible he was based on his answers. When the subject of the popularity of President Trump came up in the discussion, Gingrich confessed that he was shocked at how well Trump was doing considering a recent Harvard study that showed 93% of the post-election coverage of President Trump was negative coverage. Whoopi appeared to be close to needing medical attention after Gingrich rightfully pointed out the disgusting lopsided negative coverage that President Trump s received since he was elected. Since Goldberg had no honest rebuttal to offer, she made up a whopper of a lie, telling Gingrich and her viewers that prior to the election, 98% of candidate Trump s media coverage was  positive  and went on to suggest that was the reason he won.Sorry Whoopi but here are the actual facts about the percentage of negative coverage Trump received from the mainstream media prior to the election:From the liberal Politico: A whopping 91 percent of news coverage about Donald Trump on the three broadcast nightly newscasts over the past 12 weeks has been  hostile , a new study finds.The study, conducted by the conservative Media Research Center, found that not only has Trump received significantly more broadcast network news coverage than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, but nearly all of that coverage (91%) has been hostile, according to the study.Watch the interview here:In addition, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump, such as his treatment of women, than controversies surrounding Clinton, such as her email practices or the Clinton Foundation.For the study, MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). Of the total newscasts, the networks devoted 29 percent of their time to the campaign. The study did not include comments from the campaigns or candidates themselves, instead focusing on what the correspondents, anchors, expert commentators, and voters on the street said in order to try and hone in on any sort of slant from the networks.Though neither candidate was necessarily celebrated, Clinton largely just stayed out of the line of fire. Even when they were critical of Hillary Clinton   for concealing her pneumonia, for example, or mischaracterizing the FBI investigation of her e-mail server   network reporters always maintained a respectful tone in their coverage,  the study found.  This was not the case with Trump, who was slammed as embodying  the politics of fear,  or a  dangerous  and  vulgar   misogynistic bully  who had insulted vast swaths of the American electorate. 98% Of Pre-Election Trump Coverage Was  Positive Actual Percentage Of  Positive  Trump Coverage Is SHOCKING!",politics,"Jun 13, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"SEN TOM COTTON TO AG SESSIONS: “Do you like spy fiction: John LeCarre, Daniel Silva, Jason Mathews?……Do you like Jason Bourne or James Bond movies?” [Video]","Today s testimony between AG Sessions and Senators went from testy to hysterical when Senator Tom Cotton went into a really funny line of a combined statement with questions He started pointing out there s no evidence and then went through spy novel names then this:  Have you ever in any of these fantastical situations  Great stuff!Senator Cotton:  Let s turn to the potential crimes that we know have happened leaks of certain information. Here s a short list of what I have The contents of alleged transcripts of conversations between Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak.The contents of President Trump s phone calls of Australian and Mexican leaders.The contents of Mr. Trump s meetings with the Russian Foreign Minister and Ambassador. Cotton went on with his list it was a moment of clarity that was HUGE!In case you missed it   here s the Sessions Opening Statement:FULL OPENING STATEMENT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS  STATEMENT: It was a very strong and passionate statement from a determined Sessions.FULL TRANSCRIPT:Thank you Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner for allowing me to publicly appear before the committee today.I appreciate the Committee s critically important efforts to investigate Russian interference with our democratic process. Such interference can never be tolerated and I encourage every effort to get to the bottom of any such allegations.As you know, the Deputy Attorney General has appointed a special counsel to investigate matters related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. I am here today to address several issues that have been specifically raised before this committee, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond to questions as fully as I am able to do so. But as I advised you, Mr. Chairman, and consistent with long-standing Department of Justice practice, I cannot and will not violate my duty to protect confidential communications with the President.Now, let me address some issues directly: I did not have any private meetings nor do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel. I did not attend any meetings at that event. Prior to the speech, I attended a reception with my staff that included at least two dozen people and President Trump. Though I do recall several conversations I had during that pre-speech reception, I do not have any recollection of meeting or talking to the Russian Ambassador or any other Russian officials. If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian Ambassador during that reception, I do not remember it. After the speech, I was interviewed by the news media, which had gathered as I remember in a different room, and then I left the hotel.But whether I ever attended a reception where the Russian Ambassador was also present is entirely beside the point of this investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaigns. Let me state this clearly: I have never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign. I was your colleague in this body for 20 years, and the suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie.Relatedly, there is the assertion that I did not answer Senator Franken s question honestly at my confirmation hearing. That is false. This is how it happened. He asked me a rambling question that included dramatic, new allegations that the United States intelligence community had advised President-elect Trump that  there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump s surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.  I was taken aback by these explosive allegations, which he said were being reported in breaking news that day. I wanted to refute immediately any suggestion that I was a part of such an activity. I replied,  Senator Franken, I m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn t have   did not have communications with the Russians, and I m unable to comment on it. That was the context in which I was asked the question, and in that context, my answer was a fair and correct response to the charge as I understood it. It simply did not occur to me to go further than the context of the question and list any conversations I may have had with Russians in routine situations, as I had with numerous other foreign officials.Please hear me now. It was only in March of this year that a reporter asked my spokesperson whether I had ever met with any Russian officials. This was the first time that question had been posed. On the same day, we provided that reporter with the information related to the meeting I and my staff had held in my Senate office with Ambassador Kislyak, as well as the brief encounter in July after a speech that I had given during the convention in Cleveland, Ohio. I also provided the reporter a list of all 25 foreign ambassador meetings I had held during 2016. In addition, I provided supplemental testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain this. I readily acknowledged these two meetings. Certainly nothing improper occurred.Let me also explain clearly the circumstances of my recusal from the investigation into the Russian interference with the 2016 election. I was sworn in as Attorney General on Thursday, February 9th. The very next day, I met with career Department officials, including a senior ethics official, to discuss some things publicly reported in the press and that might have some bearing on the issue of recusal. From that point, February 10th, until I announced my formal recusal on March 2nd, I was never briefed on any investigative details and did not access information about the investigation; I received only the limited information that the Department s career officials determined was necessary to inform my recusal decision. As such, I have no knowledge about this investigation beyond what has been publicly reported, and I have taken no action with regard to any such investigation. On the date of my formal recusal, my Chief of Staff sent an email to the heads of the relevant departments, including by name to Director Comey of the FBI, to instruct them to inform their staffs of this recusal and to advise them not to brief me or involve me in any such matters. And in fact, they have not. Importantly, I recused myself not because of any asserted wrongdoing on my part during the campaign, but because a Department of Justice regulation, 28 CFR 45.2, required it. That regulation states, in effect, that Department employees should not participate in investigations of a campaign if they have served as a campaign advisor.The scope of my recusal, however, does not and cannot interfere with my ability to oversee the Department of Justice, including the FBI, which has an $8 billion budget and 35,000 employees. I presented to the President my concerns, and those of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, about the ongoing leadership issues at the FBI as stated in my letter recommending the removal of Mr. Comey along with the Deputy Attorney General s memorandum, which have been released publicly by the White House. It is a clear statement of my views. It is absurd, frankly, to suggest that a recusal from a single specific investigation would render an Attorney General unable to manage the leadership of the various Department of Justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations.Finally, during his testimony, Mr. Comey discussed a conversation he and I had about a meeting Mr. Comey had with the President. I am happy to share with the committee my recollection of the conversation I had with Mr. Comey. Following a routine morning threat briefing, Mr. Comey spoke to me and my Chief of Staff. While he did not provide me with any of the substance of his conversation with the President, Mr. Comey expressed concern about the proper communications protocol with the White House and with the President. I responded to his comment by agreeing that the FBI and Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow Department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House. Mr. Comey had served in the Department of Justice for the better part of two decades, and I was confident that Mr. Comey understood and would abide by the Department s well-established rules governing any communications with the White House about ongoing investigations. My comments encouraged him to do just that and indeed, as I understand, he did. Our Department of Justice rules on proper communication between the Department and the White House have been in place for years. Mr. Comey well knew them, I thought, and assumed correctly that he complied with them.I will finish with this. I recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for President, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations. At all times throughout the course of the campaign, the confirmation process, and since becoming Attorney General, I have dedicated myself to the highest standards.The people of this country expect an honest and transparent government and that is what we are giving them. This President wants to focus on the people of this country to ensure they are treated fairly and kept safe. The Trump agenda is to improve the lives of the American people. I know some have other agendas, but that is his agenda and it is one I share.Importantly, as Attorney General I have a responsibility to enforce the laws of this Nation, to protect this country from its enemies, and to ensure the fair administration of justice. I intend to work every day with our fine team and the superb professionals in the Department of Justice to advance the important work we have to do. These false attacks, the innuendo, and the leaks, you can be sure, will not intimidate me. In fact, these events have only strengthened my resolve to fulfill my duty to reduce crime, and to support our federal, state, and local law enforcement officers who work our streets every day. Just last week, it was reported that overdose deaths in this country are rising faster than ever recorded. The murder rate is up over 10 percent the largest increase since 1968. Together, we are telling the gangs, the cartels, the fraudsters, and the terrorists we are coming after you. Every one of our citizens, no matter who they are or where they live, has the right to be safe in their homes and communities. And I will not be deterred, and I will not allow this great Department to be deterred from its vital mission.<strong>How sad that this is happening to a very good man!</strong>",politics,"Jun 13, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
WHY DEMOCRATS KEEP LOSING: Rep. Hakeem Jeffries Calls Trump Voters “White Supremacists” [Video],"Hakeem Jeffries just exposed his Trump Derangement on the House floor. His hate for President Trump is so offensive and inappropriate. He s the definition of a JACKA$$:  We re wondering why were so many people who worship at the altar of white supremacy drawn to Donald Trump s campaign?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIakbhiZGgwHow racist and wrong of this man who says Trump voters are  dripping in hatred Unreal!During a speech on the House floor on Monday, Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) argued that while not all Trump voters are racists,  every racist in America voted for Donald Trump. Jeffries said,  Since January 20th, we ve seen a disturbing increase here in America in anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-black, anti-LGBT and anti-Semitic acts. And the question is, is this just a coincidence, or could it possibly have something to do with the election of the 45th president of the United States of America? Now, in part, what we re seeing is connected to a historic backlash that has often occurred throughout this journey that we ve been on here in America, that whenever we make significant progress, there s always a backlash amongst some in America who ve got a problem with the fact that we ve done things designed to be more consistent with our values of liberty and justice for all, equal protection under the law. After listing historical examples of this, Jeffries stated,   And then, of course, we ve got Barack Obama, who was elected in what many of us viewed as an incredible step in the right direction, African-Americans having gone from the outhouse to the White House. Eight years of tremendous progress in moving this country forward, followed by the election of Donald Trump, a man who spent five years perpetrating the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America. And many of us are wondering, why were so many people who worship at the altar of white supremacy drawn to Donald Trump s campaign? What was it about this individual that so many folks dripping in hatred flocked to his candidacy? That s not to say that every American who voted for Donald Trump is a racist. We do know that every racist in America voted for Donald Trump. that s a problem. He concluded,  And so, again, I just ask the question in closing, is this all a big coincidence? We know part of it is the backlash that has often occurred whenever we ve made progress in America, but this president has a responsibility to address the rise in hate crimes that have taken place on his watch, whether or not his election is directly connected to it.

I know some have other agendas, but that is his agenda and it is one I share.Importantly, as Attorney General I have a responsibility to enforce the laws of this Nation, to protect this country from its enemies, and to ensure the fair administration of justice. I intend to work every day with our fine team and the superb professionals in the Department of Justice to advance the important work we have to do. These false attacks, the innuendo, and the leaks, you can be sure, will not intimidate me. In fact, these events have only strengthened my resolve to fulfill my duty to reduce crime, and to support our federal, state, and local law enforcement officers who work our streets every day. Just last week, it was reported that overdose deaths in this country are rising faster than ever recorded. The murder rate is up over 10 percent the largest increase since 1968. Together, we are telling the gangs, the cartels, the fraudsters, and the terrorists we are coming after you. Every one of our citizens, no matter who they are or where they live, has the right to be safe in their homes and communities. And I will not be deterred, and I will not allow this great Department to be deterred from its vital mission.How said that this is happening to a very good man!FORMER AG MUKASEY BACKED UP THE INNOCENCE OF SESSIONS AND TRUMP EARLIER TODAY:Former AG Mukasey went there during two morning show appearances today.

CNN CUTS LIVE FEED After Senator Brings Up Clinton Attorney Joining ‘Independent’ Counsel [Video],"CNN cut away from a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this morning seconds after Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) raised concerns that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had hired a former Clinton Foundation attorney to assist with the probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Graham was questioning Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein: We found the video exchange CNN censored:Democrats have been accusing Trump of colluding with Russia BUT NO EVIDENCE HAS BEEN FOUND!Reports have emerged that Mueller has hired four attorneys for his investigative team who had donated to Hillary Clinton in the past. One of the attorneys even represented the Clinton Foundation in its effort to block Freedom of Information Act requests for e-mails on Clinton s private server! No, we re not kidding!HERE S A PORTION OF THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN GRAHAM AND ROSENSTEIN:Graham: Is giving political donations a reason to disqualify somebody for serving in the Special Counsel s office?Rosenstein: No, Senator, it is not a disqualification. It is not.Graham: As a matter of fact, many states, the judges and prosecutors are actually elected. Donations are a part of that system, is that correct?Rosenstein: Yes, that s true.Graham: Would it be a disqualification for somebody in the Special Counsel s office who had represented Mrs. Clinton in the past to serve?Rosenstein: You know, Senator, it would depend on facts and circumstances. As a general matter, I think the answer is no.Graham: Isn t that much closer to a conflict of interest?Rosenstein: I don t want to answer a hypothetical, Senator. Everybody needs to make a determination based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case.Graham: How would you get it before the Special Counsel? What process could a member of the Senate use to inform the Special Counsel that you d have a concern about hiring someone that represented Clinton?Rosenstein: We have a process within the Department of Justice, Senator, so I would encourage you, if you have those concerns, to raise them with [former] Director Mueller or to raise them with me, and I ll make sure  Graham: So should I do it to you or to him?Rosenstein: Well, you could do it to both.Graham: Okay. That s fair enough.Rosenstein: And we have career  Graham: And I don t know if I ll do that, but I ve read some things that were   I don t think donations are disqualifying at all, but if you represented the Clinton Foundation or Clinton herself, that would be disturbing to me, but I ll take care of that.CNN cut back to the studio shortly after that, while Graham was still questioning Rosenstein.",politics,"Jun 13, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
BREAKING NEWS: “At The Direction Of The President” 22-Yr Old American Is Released From N. Korean Prison [VIDEO],"22-yr old American Otto Warmbier was arrested and imprisoned during Barack Obama s last term in office. He was released  at the direction  of President Trump. Although former President Barack Obama was unable to secure her release, after being in office for less than 4 months, President Trump was also able to secure the release of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who spent three years in an Egyptian jail over what human rights groups say were bogus charges.Otto Warmbier, the college student arrested, tried and imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year for trying to swipe a souvenir from his hotel during a guided tour of the communist nation, has been released, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced Tuesday.The 22-year-old Warmbier has served just over a year of his 15-year sentence   allegedly for taking down a sign of the late dictator Kim Jong Il while Warmbier was in the country with a tour group. As of Tuesday morning, Warmbier was on his way home to Cincinnati, although other details surrounding the dramatic events were not released. At the direction of the President, the Department of State has secured the release of Otto Warmbier from North Korea,  Tillerson said.  Mr. Warmbier is en route to the United States, where he will be reunited with his family. The Department of State continues to have discussions with the DPRK regarding three other U.S. citizens reported detained. Out of respect for the privacy of Mr. Warmbier and his family, we have no further comment on Mr. Warmbier. Warmbier s parents, who have appeared on Fox News Channel in the past to plead for their son s release, expressed gratitude.

"CINDY MCCAIN Reportedly Accepts Trump Administration Position On Same Day Husband John McCain’s Outrageous Pro-Obama, Anti-Trump Remarks Are Released","The Hill released controversial comments sore loser and RINO Senator John McCain made about Trump s leadership:Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said American leadership was stronger under President Trump s predecessor, President Barack Obama, according to a Guardian report published Sunday.Asked if the country stood on sturdier ground under Obama s leadership, McCain said  yes,  according to the report. As far as American leadership is concerned, yes,  said McCain, who also vocally criticized many of the Obama administration s foreign policy decisions.For months, President Donald Trump has been trying to convince Cindy McCain a respected voice on refugees and other humanitarian issues and wife of Sen. John McCain, a Trump critic to join his administration. Now, it s a  done deal  for both parties, according to two senior administration officials.After months of being offered and rejecting several potential posts in the Trump administration, Cindy McCain and the president came to the agreement of a Washington, D.C.-based ambassador-at-large position, which would focus on anti human trafficking efforts, refugees, and humanitarian-aid matters. The title being kicked around internally is  U.S. ambassador-at-large for human rights,  though that title is subject to change, and it is unclear if a new office within the State Department would be created for her. [Trump personally], aggressively courted her for this,  one White House official told The Daily Beast.  It s a done deal now  The president had floated several positions before this is the one that stuck. A formal announcement of that new role is expected within a matter of weeks. Early last month, the Associated Press was the first to report that Cindy McCain was expected to be  offered a prominent role in the Trump administration s State Department.

AUSTRIA’S NOT PLAYING GAMES: Bans Face-Concealing Islamic Dress…Mandates “Integration” Course…Or Else,"Will Austria s new mandates help to save their nation or is it already too late? Have they already allowed political correctness to destroy their once unique culture and identity and replace it with radical Islam?Muslim students, according to new statistics, now outnumber Roman Catholic students at middle and secondary schools in Vienna, the capital and largest city of Austria.The data which show that Muslim students are also on the verge of overtaking Catholics in Viennese elementary schools reflect an established trend and provide empirical evidence of a massive demographic and religious shift underway in Austria, traditionally a Roman Catholic country.The Muslim population in Austria now exceeds 500,000 (or roughly 6% of the total population), up from an estimated 150,000 (or 2%) in 1990. The Muslim population is expected to reach 800,000 (or 9.5%) by 2030, according to recent estimates.A controversial integration law that will fine women for wearing face-concealing Islamic dress from October, and deprive of benefits migrants who fail to take language lessons has officially been enacted, after being rubber-stamped by the President. Those who are not prepared to accept Enlightenment values will have to leave our country and society,  reads the text of the law that drew thousands of protesters to the streets earlier this year, before it was passed by a centrist coalition last month.Women who will wear Islamic veils   either the burqa or the niqab   in public places, will face a fine of  150 ($168).They will also be expressly forbidden from distributing incendiary radical materials, and are encouraged to volunteer before they can get their work permits, so that they are better prepared for life in the workplace.More than 90,000 people have arrived in the Central European country since the start of the migrant crisis in 2015, most of them from Muslim-majority countries outside of Europe.The law was opposed by the left-leaning Green Party, which said that it scapegoated refugees, and the nationalist Freedom Party, which called it a window-dressing for deeper integration issues and said it had been designed to stop its rise in the polls.The centrist coalition promised that the legislation would offer a holistic approach. It has since collapsed, triggering an early election in October. Work is one of the most important factors for successful integration, which is why we are not only breaking down language barriers with this policy   we are also creating a continuous integration concept for the first time,  said Social Democratic politician Alois Stoger back in May.France was the first EU state to introduce a similar ban in 2010, levying an identical  150 fine. It has since been copied in other countries, including Germany, which has also pushed through a prohibition of face coverings for state employees.

Jedediah went on to mock Comey s whiny testimony until not funny comedian Joy Behar reminded her that what she thinks of Comey is  irrelevent.  Behar was finally correct about one thing. Sadly, what Bila says is considered irrelevent to both the left and the right. She rarely takes a position and when she does, it s such a weak position, it wasn t even worth the minimal effort she put forth.After a few minutes of defending her views on Comey, The View hacks were left somewhat stunned when Bila actually called out Comey for going along with Attorney General Loretta Lynch s suggestion to refer to Hillary s case as a  matter  as opposed to an  investigation . Bila s co-hosts wasted no time in attacking her. Whoopi quickly interjected and warned Bila to not to  muddy the waters, as  they  try to do .

WOW! MAJOR CREDIT CARD COMPANY Still Sponsoring Central Park Production Depicting Assassination Of President Trump After Other Sponsors Flee [VIDEO],"   Delta Air Lines and Bank of America became the first companies to announce they are pulling their sponsorships of a Manhattan-based theater company s portrayal of Julius Caesar as a Donald Trump look-alike in a business suit who gets stabbed to death on stage.Delta and Bank of America both announced their intentions on Sunday. No matter what your political stance may be, the graphic staging of Julius Caesar at this summer s Free Shakespeare in the Park does not reflect Delta Air Lines  values,  the company s statement said.  Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste. Bank of America added it was withdrawing funding for the production. The Public Theater chose to present Julius Caesar in such a way that was intended to provoke and offend,  the bank said in a tweet.  Had this intention been made known to us, we would have decided not to sponsor it.   Fox News American Express also took to Twitter and announced their sponsorship doesn t support the play.A Statement from American Express: pic.twitter.com/Ig0Ju3B2dP  American Express (@AmericanExpress) June 12, 2017 We would like to clarify that our sponsorship of the Public Theater does not fund the production of Shakespeare in the Park nor do we condone the interpretation of the Julius Caesar play,  the financial corporation tweeted.Customers of American Express responded on Twitter:I'm am considering not accepting AE cards at my business and reminding customers why just to clarify.  rex prescott (@rex1956) June 12, 2017Sadly, we expect the New York Times to support a production of President Trump being assassinated, but Amex customers like myself who currently use an American Express card can just as easily switch to VISA or MasterCard.

He told the Senate Intelligence Committee that such a request would match the wording of Clinton s campaign.Feinstein, who is a member of the Senate Intelligence panel, said she would ve also felt queasy. I would have a queasy feeling, too, though, to be candid with you,  the longtime Senate Democrat said.She added that an investigation separate from the ongoing probe into Russian interference in the election is needed.Read more: The Hill",politics,"Jun 12, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

“THE WAR ON COAL IS OVER”…First New Coal Mine Of Trump Presidency Opens In Pennsylvania…Another Promise Kept [VIDEO]," So much winning!  Were  going to be winning so much, you re going to be sick of winning!  -Candidate Donald J. TrumpPresident Donald Trump hailed the opening Thursday of a new coal mine as proof deregulation is helping bring jobs to the industry, even though plans for the mine s opening were made well before Trump s election.Corsa Coal Corp. will supply coal used in making steel and is expected to generate up to 100 full-time jobs. The company said it decided in August to open the Acosta mine 60 miles south of Pittsburgh after a steel industry boom drove up prices for metallurgical coal.Under a tent perched hundreds of feet above a freshly dug coal pit, about 200 miners, business leaders, and politicians celebrated amid the surge of enthusiasm for the industry. Mining headgear lay atop red, white, and blue table cloths labeled  Make Coal Great Again. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said the mine was part of an effort to bring back jobs and industry to the state. Pennsylvania awarded a $3 million grant for the project. We have not always capitalized on our standing as one of the world s leaders in these resources, but we re changing that,  Wolf said.Trump has made reversing the decades-long decline in coal mining the central tenet of his environmental policy, blaming federal regulations aimed at curbing planet-warming carbon emissions for job losses in the industry. Trump and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt have targeted laws that protected waterways from coal waste and required states to slash carbon emissions from power plants. About a dozen protesters chanted in opposition to the mine at the opening.Trump noted the impending opening of the mine last week during his speech announcing the nation s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. He said then he had hoped to attend the event; he participated via recorded video message, taking partial credit for the opening. One by one, we re eliminating the regulations that threaten your jobs, and that s one of the big reasons you re opening today: Less regulation,  Trump said.  We have withdrawn the United States from the horrendous Paris climate accord, something that would have put our country back decades and decades, we would have never allowed ourselves to be great again.

VICIOUS BERNIE SANDERS Goes on Angry Anti-Christian Tirade Against Deputy Budget Nominee [Video],"BERNIE SANDERS decided to go after the religion of a nominee for Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget This was a vicious attack on RUSSELL VOUGHT who has strong Christian beliefs that have absolutely nothing to do with what he was being questioned about. Religious beliefs aren t budgetary concerns. This was a personal attack on a DEVOUTLY RELIGIOUS man who had written an article years past defending his Christian College.PART OF THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN SANDERS AND VOUGHT:Sanders is quoting from an article that Vought wrote:  Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned.  Do you believe that that statement is Islamophobic?Vought: Absolutely not, Senator. I m a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith.Sanders: Forgive me, we just don t have a lot of time. Do you believe people in the Muslim religion stand condemned? Is that your view?Vought: Again, Senator, I m a Christian, and I wrote that piece in accordance with the statement of faith at Wheaton College.Sanders: I understand that. I don t know how many Muslims there are in America. Maybe a couple million. Are you suggesting that these people stand condemned? What about Jews? Do they stand condemned too?Vought: Senator, I m a Christian.Sanders: I understand you are a Christian, but this country [is] made of people who are not just I understand that Christianity is the majority religion, but there are other people of different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?Vought: Thank you for probing on that question. As a Christian, I believe that all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs. I believe that as a Christian that s how I should treat all individuals.Sanders: Do you think that s respectful of other religions?I would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who this country is supposed to be about. I will vote  no. CAN THE US GOVERNMENT IMPOSE RELIGIOUS TESTS FOR PUBLIC OFFICE:The Constitution says the U.S. government can t impose religious tests for public office. But scholars say Sen. Bernie Sanders can without consequence apply his own religious rubric in opposing a presidential nominee who believes non-Christians risk going to hell.The Vermont independent, who is Jewish but  not particularly religious,  grilled Russell Vought, nominee to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, on Wednesday, focusing on an article he wrote that said Muslims  do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his Son, and they stand condemned. Sanders asked if that view was Islamophobic, and if Jews also stand condemned.Vought responded that he is a Christian.  In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?  Sanders asked. Vought began to answer before Sanders interrupted, asking if that viewpoint was  respectful of other religions. National Review columnist David French writes that Sanders was  imposing a religious test for public office in direct violation of Article VI of the United States Constitution  and that he was objecting to  entirely orthodox Christian beliefs  about access to heaven.Constitutional scholars say Sanders, who said he will vote against Vought, may violate the spirit of the Constitution, but arguably not Article VI, which states:  no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. No senator should vote against a nominee based on his or her religion. It would violate the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution. But senators can vote against nominees for any reason or no reason at all. There would be no legal consequence, and the nominee would have no forum for complaint. Allan Vestal of Drake University Law School says the Constitution s religious-test ban  does not provide a mechanism for inquiring into the motivations of individual senators and representatives in the votes they cast. There is no constitutional constraint on yea or nay votes, so yes he can do it,  agrees Richard Epstein, a New York University law professor.Read more: US News",politics,"Jun 11, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
“MY HOMETOWN IS GONE” A Shocking First-Hand Account of the Islamization of an American Small Town,"Did you know that over 15 thousand so-called Muslim  refugees  have been admitted to the US since inauguration day?WHERE DID THEY GO? 15,726 Mostly Muslim Refugees Admitted Since Inauguration DayAmericans have got to wake up and see what s happening to us!Loretta Brady has written the best ever first-hand account of the damage the refugee resettlement program is doing to America s small towns. It s truly a must-read! Please share!I gave a talk at a luncheon a few months ago that was basically relating my story of how my hometown has been Islamized by refugee resettlement. So it makes sense to do a blog post.I m from the Utica, NY area. Utica is the city nicknamed by the UN  the city that loves refugees!  Soon every American city will be a city that loves refugees! Get ready! So I would like to tell you what it is like living in an area where the major city is about 25% (or more) refugee, mainly MuslimI was born in Utica, a  faded industrial town  along the Mohawk River/Erie Canal corridor, and lived there until I was 8-years-old when my family moved to a nearby small college town. I loved living in Utica because there were lots of families on my block, big Catholic families with lots of kids. You could yard-hop, checking out who was available for play. You could bike around the neighborhood. There were block parties in the summer. My grandmother lived up the street. Life was good.My father and his father were born and lived in Utica, NY. My father was a judge in Utica, like his father before him. The Catholic school my father attended is now a community center for refugees. After I moved back to the Utica area as an adult I used to recite  Full fathom five  to the children as we drove by my father s former Catholic school. (Nothing of him that doth fade,/But doth suffer a sea change/Into something rich and strange.)When I had my first child I was living in New York City. Her father and I divorced when she was a baby, and when she was two-years-old, I beat a hasty retreat back home to Upstate NY. There I met my husband. We got married, we had babies (in that order, ahem), and we settled down outside of Utica.When I moved back home one of the first things I noticed was that an old Methodist church was being converted into a bright shiny white new mosque. The local paper touted this as immense progress and featured a local woman who had attended the church as a child and was positively brimming with joy it was being turned into a mosque. If that is the general sentiment, then it s odd that my county went for Trump, right? There are at least two mosques in the city now. They just built another.Where do I start? Utica had always been  the city that loves refugees  but under Obama things accelerated. Muslim immigrants were suddenly in these local bureaucratic positions where they had power over you. This, in what is probably one of the most corrupt states in the union, where the power of the state is everything.The social worker at my daughter s school was a Muslim immigrant. I looked for her profile on the school website, I googled her, I could not find information on her background, resume, qualifications, or educational attainments.When I began to homeschool my daughter the administrator to whom I had to submit paperwork was a Muslim immigrant. To homeschool in New York State you must submit detailed quarterly reports to an administrator at your local school district. I googled the administrator. He also worked at the local Board of Cooperative Educational Services, but I could not find any other information on his background, resume, qualifications, or educational attainments.I was friends with the wife of the Orthodox priest at our church, and she told me that this administrator found some problems with her paperwork and challenged her. It turned out she was right about the issue, and he backed down. Comfy little situation, right?Right before we moved I went to the ER. The nurse practitioner was a Muslim immigrant (Bosnia), and the doctor she worked under was a Muslim immigrant (Pakistan). I remember how during the visit I suddenly became very aware of the cross I always wear around my neck.In 2012 on the way home from my daughter s piano lesson, I left my children in the car, ran into the supermarket for ten minutes, and came out to find a man outside my car who informed me he had called the police. I called my husband and my parents and together we waited for the police officer who eventually arrived and arrested me. Lenore Skenazy wrote an account of the incident in the Wall Street Journal. It is pretty accurate except that it wasn t a suburb, it was a village of less than 2,000 people.It was a terrible thing to do, but it was not hot (we re about two hours from the Canadian border), it was the small safe village where I grew up (I think I was the only arrest that week), and I spent half my childhood hanging out in the car with my brother while my mother did errands. My friend sent me a Salon article (I don t read Salon) about a mom who did the same thing, and she like me was in her hometown where she grew up, and so automatically just living by the rules she grew up with. My mother never got arrested. It didn t occur to me I would be arrested. That s my only arrest. So far. But anyway, the point of this story is I was then investigated (and cleared which I hope should be obvious) by CPS.The CPS worker who investigated me was Muslim.So let me just summarize: the social worker at the school is Muslim, the administrator who ok s homeschooling is Muslim, the CPS worker is Muslim, the nurse practitioner at the ER is Muslim, the doctor at the ER is Muslim. These are positions of authority that wield a lot of power.Are you starting to get the picture?The spring before we moved Utica made national news because of a federal grant to the local community college (two million dollars) for a (Muslim immigrant) professor to teach teenage (Muslim) refugees how to build drones. The grant didn t mention explicitly that the drones would be equipped with bombs or anything, so it was all aboveboard. This was going on like down the road from us. My husband assured me he could shoot any drone out of the sky, and I m sure he could, but curiously enough that didn t assuage my anxiety, but only exacerbated it. The last thing I needed was my husband getting arrested on federal charges for taking down a drone.I looked up the Muslim immigrant professor on Linked In. It was an odd career trajectory. It looked like he had been a soccer coach a few years before. It wasn t exactly clear to me how he had landed his present job where he was getting federal money to train Muslims to build drones, but, hey, that s the Obama era for you.In 2015, a 26-year-old Bosnian refugee in Utica was arrested for supporting ISIS. The local paper reported that in his spare time when he wasn t supporting ISIS, he enjoyed mixed martial arts fighting at the local gym. Local law enforcement complained they hadn t been informed of the investigation. You know and I know that if anything happens, local law enforcement are the first responders.I went to a couple Trump rallies and meetings in Upstate NY before we moved. When I mentioned the arrest of this ISIS supporter to a local businessman at one of the meetings, he got a very serious look and said Utica was full of ISIS and the local police were really worried. The Trump meetings were emotional. The organizer picked a donut shop whose owner was friendly to the Trump platform so we could talk. Everyone went around the table and introduced themselves. Two of the women cried. New York State is not doing well.Don t believe the Start-Up NY commercials. Potemkin Village.My husband lost two jobs in three years in Upstate NY. Not by any fault of his own- he is a very skilled, dedicated, experienced, hard worker- but because his bosses went out of business. His first boss moved to North Carolina. His second boss had to close up shop, which seemed linked to a downturn in the stock market. A lot of the middle class in Upstate NY are boomer retirees, and when the stock market goes down, they get nervous and cut back on renovation and building. My husband is a carpenter.The Upstate New York economy is one of the worst in the country. That s why it s a good place to resettle refugees.After the second time my husband lost his job, I applied for food stamps for the family. When I moved back home I had tried to find a job as a lawyer, I could not. I finally found a job processing letters of credit for an investment bank. My salary was $27,000 a year. I actually got paid an extra $2,000 higher than starting salary for my translation skills. After I had my second child, most of my pay after taxes would have gone to childcare. The New York State tax system penalizes low-income people who work. So I stayed home. My parents helped us with bills.So my husband was unemployed, I was unemployed, we have four children, we certainly qualified for food stamps, and I felt stupid and irresponsible for not applying when we qualified for them, so I applied. The local Department of Social Services does not answer their phone. You can go there and wait in line. It is a very very long line, and a very uncomfortable place to be. By tacit agreement, the white people stick together in the waiting area. The Department of Social Services rejected my application several times without reason. I knew we qualified, so it became for me this bureaucratic challenge that I had to vanquish. It took a lot of wrangling and some certified sign-for-delivery mailings which were expensive. I managed to get us a month of food stamps. It was about $50 a week, I think, for a family of six. I don t know if that s average or not.Want to know why my application was rejected several times even though we qualified? Want to know why it was so difficult to get food stamps? The Department of Social Services in my area is swamped because of the refugees. 25% of the city are refugees. Virtually all of the refugees are on welfare. And when they apply for welfare, they don t do so as an independent entity, as I did. They go through their refugee resettlement agency who deals with the Department of Social Services for them. So basically Americans get the short shrift, and refugees get taken care of. And that s America. This is why so many Democrats voted for Trump. Americans are getting squeezed out by non-Americans at multiple levels.What else to tell you?New York State sued our local school districhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/nyregion/new-york-state-accuses-utica-school-district-of-bias-against-refugees.html?_r=1t for trying to separate teenage refugees from the rest of the students. I went to a CLE where I sat next to a lawyer for the school district, and she was freaking out over this lawsuit. She was like, The state is coming after us, and we don t have any money. My county is a Democrat county, and Trump won my county. Issues like this are why. Americans can see that they are being forced to accommodate non-Americans to their own detriment and expense.There is TB in Utica. I m sure there is more than reported. Obama stopped screening foreigners for TB, which America has been doing since before the days of Ellis Island, and the refugees are from places where TB is endemic. Whenever I was in a hospital- when I gave birth or when I went to the ER- I would be very aware of my surroundings.The local Walmart is full of headscarves and burkas. I cried when I went into my first Walmart in North Carolina and all I saw were Americans.The nice lady who asked me to give a talk a couple months ago on my hometown asked me if there were any refugees who were an  asset to the community . I replied that they do not consider themselves part of your community, so if they are going to be an asset to any community, it is not going to be yours.I hope I ve presented an idea of why I m so opposed to refugee resettlement. I couldn t write this blog post where I m from. I d be scared that someone would target my house. I d be scared of the authorities. I had to wait to get to higher ground to speak more openly.North Carolina is like Heaven. People are so much happier here. I thank God every day we got here. I consider it a  free zone , and I want it to stay free.Please also check out my other blog post on Utica, NY. I wrote it after my husband and I drove into the city on a random Sunday and saw about a dozen refugees (all women, and you know there had to be men as well, who just weren t present at the time) moving into renovated housing. This is in an area where low-income Americans, white and black, languish in subpar housing. A lot went on under the Obama Administration. And I doubt a lot of it was on the books.

JOE BIDEN’S NIECE Too Big To Jail? Released After 100K Credit Card Fraud,"The rules must not apply to Caroline Biden, niece of Joe Biden The wild-child niece of former Veep Joe Biden stole more than $100,000 in a credit card scam   and quietly cut a plea deal in Manhattan court that spares her any jail time, The Post has learned.Using a borrowed credit card, the blonde Caroline Biden set up an unauthorized customer account at Bigelow Pharmacy on Sixth Avenue in Greenwich Village, and racked up the six-figure bill over the course of a year, according to a criminal complaint that does not name the victim card owner.As part of a plea deal before Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Kevin McGrath, Biden, 29, pleaded guilty to one charge of grand larceny and another of petit larceny and agreed to make restitution of $110,810.04.If she pays everything back and keeps her nose clean, she can return to court and enter a substitute plea to a lower, misdemeanor charge of petit larceny and be sentenced to two years probation.But she ll stay out of jail even if she fails to live up to the plea deal, instead getting sentenced on the felony larceny to five years probation.Defense lawyer Ira London declined to comment.Biden was also in Manhattan Criminal Court in 2014, on charges of resisting arrest, obstruction of justice and harassment stemming from a dustup with her Tribeca roommate.In that case, the silver-spoon Georgetown University graduate was accused of taking a swing at a female cop who responded in Sept. 2013 to a drag out fight over unpaid rent between Biden and her roommate. I shouldn t be handcuffed!  cops said Biden railed at the time.  You don t know who you re doing this to! She was given another sweetheart deal in that case: a promise that the charges would be dismissed if she stayed out of trouble for six months.The charges were eventually dismissed and sealed.Read more: NYP",politics,"Jun 10, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

HILARIOUS! TRUMP Reserves “Special Seats” For NYT’s Reporters At Press Conference After Publishing FAKE NEWS On Russian Probe,"Former FBI Director James Comey admitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday that he asked a Columbia professor friend to leak a memo he kept regarding his conversation with President Trump to the press.The memo was leaked to one of the key players in the witch hunt for a Russian connection with President Trump Russia, the New York Times, the leftist media arm of the Democrat Party. The New York Times ran with the story that Trump was pushing Comey to drop the Flynn investigation.GP: Comey also told the Senate Intelligence Committee he knew The New York Times was publishing leaked reports that were not accurate. But James Comey said he would not tell the NY Times about their fraudulent report because that would not be right (?).Jame Comey s priorities are a bit confusing.Zero Hedge   For those of you who continue to consume anonymously-sourced news from the likes of CNN, NYT, WAPO, etc, as pure fact and a perfect substitute for actual, unbiased journalism, while blindly ignoring the overwhelming evidence which continues to suggest these outlets are simply pushing a sensationalized narrative aimed at bringing down an administration of which they disapprove, please consider Comey s testimony from earlier today in which he describes a February NY Times story, which alleged numerous contacts between Trump associates and Russia, as  almost entirely wrong Meanwhile, in earlier testimony with Senator Risch, Comey further explained why anonymously sourced stories can often be pure  nonsense. Comey:   In the main it was not true.  And, again, all of you know this, maybe the American people do not, the challenge, and I m not picking on reporters, about writing stories about classified information is, the people talking about it often don t really know what s going on and those of us who actually know what s going on are not talking about it.And we don t call the press to say  hey, you got that thing wrong about his sensitive topic.' I mentioned to the chairman the nonsense around what influenced me to make the July 5th Statement.  Nonsense, but I can t go explaining why it s nonsense.

“BALONEY!” CNN Anchor Slammed By Weather Channel Founder Over Global Warming Scam [Video],"John Coleman, Founder, The Weather Channel, appeared on CNN s Reliable Sources with host Brian Stelter, after writing an open letter to UCLA denying the existence of anthropogenic global warming. This is a great takedown:Coleman told Stelter that  CNN has taken a very strong position on global warming that it is a consensus. Well there is no consensus in science. Science isn t a vote. Science is about facts,  and that he was  terribly disappointed  by his former network, The Weather Channel, because it  has bought into [climate change]. But so has all the media. That s no big surprise. Coleman notes that he is  not a  paid shill  (as has been claimed) of the Koch Brothers,  concluding his letter with a link to Heartland s Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) website. Coleman s open letter to UCLA was sent to numerous local television stations in the Los Angeles area, as well as the Los Angeles Times.Coleman produced a special report for KUSI-TV, entitled Global Warming: The Other Side. The program suggests that Global Warming is a scam and presents what Colemen contends is evidence of a deliberate manipulation of world temperature data by NASA and other groups.

CLASSIC! PRESIDENT TRUMP Totally Rips CNN Reporter At Presser Over Comey Hearing [Video],"President Trump spoke in the Rose Garden today in a presser with Romania s leader It got contentious when CNN s Jonathan Karl asked questions about the Comey testimony It s a classic!Trump knows how to throw down the hammer on people. It s awesome!JONATHAN KARL RECENTLY HAD A RUN IN WITH SARA HUCKABEE-SANDERS: ABC s Jonathan Karl asked a very spunky Sara Huckabee-Sanders (yes, Sara is the daughter of the very funny and sarcastic former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee) if Vice President Pence was  in the dark  about the firing of FBI Director James Comey? Sara snapped back,  Nobody was in the dark Jonathan! You wanna create this false narrative. If we want talk about ah contradicting statements and people that were maybe in the dark, how about the Democrats?  Let s read a few of them. You wanna talk about  em? Here s what Democrats said not that long ago about James Comey :Harry Reid said,  Comey should resign and be investigated by the Senate. Senator Chuck Schumer,  I don t have confidence in him anymore.  Senator Bernie Sanders said,  It would not be a bad thing for the American people if Comey resigned.  Nancy Pelosi said,  Comey was not in the right job.  Former DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that she thought Comey was no longer able to serve in a neutral and credible way.  President Obama s advisor Valerie Jarrett reportedly urged him to fire Comey.  Just yesterday, Representative Maxine Waters said that,  Hillary Clinton would have fired Comey.  You wanna talk about people who are in the dark? The people that are in the dark today are the Democrats.Boom!Earlier today, we posted a video that President Trump posted to his Twitter page pointing out the absurd hypocrisy of the Democrats and their allies in the liberal media.

WATCH: PRESIDENT TRUMP Calls Out Feds On Overregulation: “It took only four years to build the Golden Gate Bridge” [Video],"PRESIDENT TRUMP ON OVERREGULATION:  They spent $29 million for an environmental report weighing 70 lbs. and costing $24,000 per page. I said, do me a favor, I m going to make a speech in a little while, do you mind if I take that and show it? So I m going to show it.  The president then walked away from the podium and flipped through the pages of the binder, then let each one hit the ground with a thud.With Trump s speech, the White House s so-called  infrastructure week  came to an end Friday. The effort was meant to highlight the need to speed up the permitting process before roads, bridges, ports and tracks across the country can be built. It took only four years to build the Golden Gate Bridge and five years to build the Hoover Dam and less than one year to build the Empire State building but today it can take 10 years just to get the approvals and permits needed to build a major infrastructure project,  Trump said.On Monday, the White House kicked off a weeklong focus on infrastructure, announcing a series of events and speeches where the president would draw attention to the issue his advisers say they hope can be tackled this year. We have structurally deficient bridges, clogged roads, crumbling dams and rocks, our rivers are in trouble, our railways are aging and chronic traffic that slows commerce and diminishes our citizens quality of life,  Trump said Friday.  Other than that, we are doing very well.

JUDGE JEANINE ON JAMES COMEY: “He’s a predator!” [Video],"Judge Jeanine commented this morning on the FBI Director s testimony yesterday and in true Judge Jeanine style she didn t hold back! Why is he so comfortable with leaking? The answers were hogwash! Judge Jeanine is spot on in her assessment of Comey:James Comey comes across as someone who is so wily and so calculating  He gets to the point that he says,  I m going to start leaking this stuff now.  What is is about his time his background as a prosecutor. And, what I would like to know is, is he the leaker?Is he the guy who was so comfortable. And the answer is why did he didn t leak it himself, and the seagulls and the beach, is hogwash  The fact that he is so comfortable, that he leaks this to a liberal professer, tells me he was a predator.He was looking to take Donald down.

He met with representatives from the coal industry to sign a bill undoing Obama s coal mining rule. The people s president is a worker!OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON SCOTT PRUITT S APPOINTMENT TO EPA CHIEF THE LEFT WENT BONKERS!OKLAHOMA ATTORNEY GENERAL SCOTT PRUITT is another perfect choice from President-elect Donald Trump. He s sued the feds several times for their overreach in regulations on the coal industry. You have to love his commitment to keeping the federal government on the straight and narrow. It s funny that so many of Trump s picks have gone against Obama s policies We love it! The lefty politicians in DC wasted no time tweeted out their displeasure:When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules regulating carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, Scott Pruitt sued. When the Justice Department offered legal status to young undocumented immigrants, Scott Pruitt sued. And when the Obama administration sought to give tax credits to states that hadn t set up their own health insurance exchanges, Scott Pruitt sued.Since becoming Oklahoma attorney general in 2010, Pruitt has filed or joined lawsuits against federal agencies at least a dozen times. Even when Oklahoma isn t an actual party in litigation, the state often submits a legal brief against the federal government. Besides air pollution, immigration and health care, Pruitt has fought federal laws and regulations on banking, contraception and endangered species. These days, whenever states go to court against the Obama administration, the chances are that Pruitt is somehow involved.Not that Pruitt is alone. During Obama s presidency, the entire cadre of Republican attorneys general (27 at present) has coordinated cases against federal agencies at an unprecedented pace. But Pruitt is at the center of the action. He has set up a first-in-the-nation  federalism unit,  which seeks to combat instances of federal overreach by every possible means.Read more: Governing",politics,"Jun 9, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
FAST AND FURIOUS Hearing Rips Obama and Holder for Obstruction: “ATF and DOJ officials implemented an all-out campaign to silence me” [Video],"Members of a congressional committee ripped Obama and his attorney general for covering up an investigation into the death of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Terry was killed as a result of a botched government gun-running project known as Operation Fast and Furious:The House Oversight Committee also Wednesday released a scathing, nearly 300-page report that found Holder s Justice Department tried to hide the facts from the loved ones of slain Border Patrol Brian Terry   seeing his family as more of a  nuisance  than one deserving straight answers   and slamming Obama s assertion of executive privilege to deny Congress access to records pertaining to Fast and Furious.Senator Grassley accused the DOJ and ATF officials of obstructing the investigation and working to silence ATF agents who informed the Senate of Fast and Furious: The Department of Justice and ATF had no intention of looking for honest answers and being transparent. In fact, from the onset, bureaucrats employed shameless delay tactics to obstruct the investigation. One of the silenced ATF agents, John Dodson, testified Wednesday that he remains  in a state of purgatory  since objecting to Fast and Furious and has been the subject of reprisals and ridicule at the agency: That decision, the single act of standing up and saying,  What we are doing is wrong  instantly took my standing from being that of an agent of the government   to an enemy of the state. ATF and DOJ officials implemented an all-out campaign to silence and discredit me. Suffice to say, the last six to seven years at ATF have not been the best for me or my career. Grassley s and Dodson s testimony reinforced findings of the report, which states that the Justice Department knew before Terry s death that the ATF was  walking  firearms to Mexico and knew the day after the agent s death that Fast and Furious guns were involved in the shootout   despite denying these facts to the media. It goes on to state that the Justice Department s internal investigation focused more on spinning the story to avoid negative media coverage than looking into lapses by either the DOJ or ATF.The whistleblower testimony is especially compelling at the 42:00 point of the video:Several emails revealed in the report appear to indicate that some Justice Department staffers were working to keep information from political appointees at the department. I don t want to jinx it but it really is astounding that the plan worked   so far,  former Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote in an email to Holder, according to the report.The report also says that Holder s Justice Department stonewalled inquiries from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and deceptively told him that the  ATF makes every effort to interdict  firearms purchased by straw buyers. There are important reasons for not giving Grassley everything he is asking for: it would embolden him in future fights and would  use up  a lot of the material that we will eventually need to release to (California Rep. Darrell) Issa . . . as the oversight struggle continues,  the Office of Legislative Affairs Assistant Attorney General Ron Welch said in an email to DOJ colleagues.Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry died in a gunfight between Border Patrol agents and members of a six-man cartel  rip crew,  which regularly patrolled the desert along the U.S.-Mexico border looking for drug dealers to rob.Read more: FOX",politics,"Jun 9, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"MALE PAKISTANI IMMIGRANT Dresses As Woman In Burqa…Lures 11 Yr Old Boy From Mosque…Rapes, Strangles Him To Death","A man disguised himself in a burka in order to lure an 11-year-old boy whom he then raped and strangled to death, according to police in Abu Dhabi.The accused was aware that the boy would not accompany him if he knew he was a man, the Gulf News reported.The suspect, a Pakistani immigrant to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, is said to be known to the family of the victim, whose father is Pakistani and mother is Russian.He is accused of raping the boy and strangling him to death with a rope after picking him up from Ramadan prayers at a mosque.Azan Majid Janjua was reported missing last week after failing to come home from the mosque.He was later found by air-conditioning technicians on the roof of the building where he lived.He was reportedly found partially unclothed with his Quran lying beside him.The suspect was arrested within 48 hours of the discovery of the body, police said, after forensic evidence linked him to the crime.They declined to give any further details about the suspect or the evidence incriminating him.The murdered boy s father, Dr Majid Janjua, 38, told the local news site that his son was not in the habit of going off with strangers. He never went outside without our permission,  said Dr Janjua.  It is fate; Allah s decision. We have to accept it. The boy s mother is understood not to live in the Gulf state but was visiting at the time of the incident, which took place in the first week of the Islamic holy month Ramadan.For entire story: Daily Mail ",politics,"Jun 8, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

UPDATE: COMEY’S LEAKER Goes Into Hiding [Video],"A Columbia University professor from Brooklyn went into hiding Thursday after pal James Comey revealed during his Senate testimony that the man leaked memos detailing the former FBI chief s conversations with President Trump to the press.But Richman had vanished from his Henry Street digs by midday, and family members, friends and neighbors wouldn t answer doors or phone calls to shed any more light.A doorman eventually turned security guard to stop reporters entering the building.Richman s wife, Alexandra Bowie, is a former president of the influential neighborhood civic group the Brooklyn Heights Association. Its director, Peter Bray, declined to speak about the man who had suddenly usurped Lena Dunham as the nabe s most famous inhabitant.Comey said in his testimony that he decided to give the content of his Trump memo to his good friend to leak to the press after President Trump tweeted out about possible  takes  of their conversations. Comey also said of leaking the memo,  I thought it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.  Via: NYPWho knew the FBI Director was a leaker! This is too much!

Chris Matthews had to admit that there s no case in the witch hunt on Trump.

And yet what came apart this morning was that theory Flynn wasn t central to the Russian investigation, and secondly, that kills the idea that Flynn might have been in a position to testify against Trump.

BUSTED! TRUMP LAWYER Nails Comey on a BIG LIE While Under Oath! [Video],"President Trump s lawyer Marc Kasowitz made a statement after the Comey Testimony and nailed the fact that Comey lied under oath! This is a whopper: Comey testified that he only leaked the memos in response to a tweet. The public record reveals that The New York Times was quoting from those memos the day before the referenced tweet.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWrt7eDOUXUTRANSCRIPT:  Contrary to numerous false press accounts leading up to today s hearing, Mr. Comey has now finally confirmed publicly what he repeatedly told the President privately: The President was not under investigation as part of any probe into Russian interference. He also admitted that there is no evidence that a single vote changed as a result of any Russian interference.Mr Comey s testimony also makes clear that the President never sought to impede the investigation into attempted Russian interference in the 2016 election, and in fact, according to Mr. Comey, the President told Mr. Comey  it would be good to find out  in that investigation if there were  some  satellite  associates of his who did something wrong.  And he did not exclude anyone from that statement.Consistent with that statement, the President never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone, including suggesting that that Mr. Comey let Flynn go.  As he publicly stated the next day, he did say to Mr. Comey,  General Flynn is a good guy, he has been through a lot  and also  asked how is General Flynn is doing.  Admiral Rogers testified that the President never  directed [him] to do anything . . . illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate  and never  pressured [him] to do so.  Director Coates said the same thing. The President likewise never pressured Mr. Comey. .The President also never told Mr. Comey,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty  in form or substance. Of course, the Office of the President is entitled to expect loyalty from those who are serving in an administration, and, from before this President took office to this day, it is overwhelmingly clear that there have been and continue to be those in government who are actively attempting to undermine this administration with selective and illegal leaks of classified information and privileged communications. Mr. Comey has now admitted that he is one of these leakers.Today, Mr. Comey admitted that he unilaterally and surreptitiously made unauthorized disclosures to the press of privileged communications with the President. The leaks of this privileged information began no later than March 2017 when friends of Mr. Comey have stated he disclosed to them the conversations he had with the President during their January 27, 2017 dinner and February 14, 2017 White House meeting. Today, Mr. Comey admitted that he leaked to friends his purported memos of these privileged conversations, one of which he testified was classified. He also testified that immediately after he was terminated he authorized his friends to leak the contents of these memos to the press in order to  prompt the appointment of a special counsel. Although Mr. Comey testified he only leaked the memos in response to a tweet, the public record reveals that the New York Times was quoting from these memos the day before the referenced tweet, which belies Mr. Comey s excuse for this unauthorized disclosure of privileged information and appears to entirely retaliatory. We will leave it the appropriate authorities to determine whether this leaks should be investigated along with all those others being investigated.In sum, it is now established that there the President was not being investigated for colluding with the or attempting to obstruct that investigation. As the Committee pointed out today, these important facts for the country to know are virtually the only facts that have not leaked during the long course of these events.

This is troubling because it portends to what we ve known all along Bill Clinton was meeting with Lynch to fight Hillary s battle. They won t reveal it because it would implicate so many people in government Are we right?A citizen researcher from Florida is attempting to have the recording of the infamous Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch tarmac tape released to the public, but apparently, the National Security Agency claims they won t release it due to  national security. The man researching and seeking to have the tape released is Florida orthodontist Larry Kawa. You may remember him because of Judicial Watch s filing of a lawsuit on his behalf to obtain a week s worth of Hillary Clinton s emails regarding Benghazi.It s being reported now that the NSA has declared the recording of the conversation that took place between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch in Phoenix, Arizona on June 27, 2016.Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request in March of this year to obtain the following:Any and all records and/or transcripts of a meeting held between Attorney General Loretta lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all references to the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton contained in day planners, calendars and schedules in the Office of theAttorney General. This brings us to Kawa. In an article at Big League Politics, Patrick Howley writes:The National Security Agency (NSA) blocked the release of a purported tape of Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch s private airplane talk with a rare legal justification used to protect top national security secrets.The NSA s block of the release of this information   citing one of President Obama s executive orders   undercuts Hillary Clinton s claim that her husband and Lynch had a  purely social  conversation about grandkids and golf on June 27, 2016, two weeks before Lynch dropped the Department of Justice investigation into Hillary Clinton s email scandal.Read more: Freedom Outpost",politics,"Jun 8, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"PROOF That Obama Interfered TWICE In Foreign Elections, Including Time He Used U.S. TAXPAYER MONEY To Defeat Conservative Israeli Leader [VIDEO]","President Barack Obama recently said he told Russian President Vladimir Putin to  knock it off  back in September. Obama s alleged demand was a result of the supposed  hacking  of the computers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), in what has been presented as an attempt by the Russians to influence the outcome of the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.This alleged effort by the Russians was even cited as a reason to block Trump s election in the Electoral College. Some presidential electors even asked for an intelligence briefing before they cast their votes, so they would know exactly what Putin s government did. Of course, almost all those asking for the briefing were Democrat electors already voting for Trump s Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton, so it could be dismissed as just a political ploy.But, if the Russians did covertly attempt to alter the outcome of the presidential election, it would seem somewhat hypocritical of the U.S. government to take umbrage. After all, the United States, under several presidents both Democrat and Republican, has repeatedly interfered in foreign elections, both covertly and overtly, multiple times in the past several decades.Most recently, President Obama told British voters that they better not vote for Brexit   the public vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (EU)   or they would find themselves  at the back of the queue [line]  in getting any sort of trade deal with the United States. Of course, with Obama leaving office on January 20, he would not be making any trade deals with anyone much longer anyway.Here is the video of Barack Obama attempting to influence the Brexit vote by threatening to put them at the back of the que:Obama went on to say,  I think this [membership in the EU] makes you guys bigger players,  at a joint press conference with then-British Prime Minister David Cameron, a staunch supporter of remaining in the EU. In the end, the British did not take Obama s  advice,  and opted to leave the EU.It was not the first time that the Obama administration attempted to determine the outcome of a foreign election. In the last Israeli election, the Obama State Department funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money to the opposition of Israel s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that the State Department and a group called One Voice coordinated political activities   including the building of a voter database, the training of activists, and the hiring of a political consulting firm tied to President Obama himself.Watch here:Yet, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has charged that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election by releasing e-mails damaging to the Clinton campaign effort. But why is it acceptable for the United States government to interfere in another nation s election campaign efforts, but not acceptable for other countries   including Russia   to (allegedly) interfere in U.S. elections?The Brexit vote and Israeli election are not the only times this has happened. Don Levin of Carnegie Mellon University has documented 81 times the United States has attempted to influence presidential elections in other countries between 1946 and 2000. And then, of course, there are the military coups backed by the United States and the regime changes imposed by military actions. In his study, Levin described  intervention  as including funding of the election campaigns of selected political parties, the dissemination of political propaganda, training of local activists in political techniques, and public comments by high-ranking U.S. officials, favoring or disfavoring one side or the other. He also included public threats to withdraw foreign aid, or even promises to provide it if one side were to be elected.For entire story: The American",politics,"Jun 8, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
CNN BLASTED FOR FAKE NEWS ON TRUMP…Finally Issues Retraction,"WOW! Not until people like Brett Hume tweeted out bashing CNN for their fake news did CNN finally retract a lie about Trump.CNN has FINALLY corrected a Tuesday report after the release of former FBI Director James Comey s opening statement for his Thursday testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee contradicted the reports  sources.The CNN report said Comey was expected to dispute President Trump s claims that Comey said he was not under investigation on multiple occasions.The report, titled  Comey expected to refute Trump,  was based on unnamed sources and said Comey s conversations with the president  were much more nuanced,  and that Trump drew the wrong conclusion.The story was complied by four CNN journalists, including Gloria Borger, Eric Lichtblau, Jake Tapper and Brian Rokus.Borger reiterated the reports claims in an appearance on CNN Tuesday. Comey is going to dispute the president on this point if he s asked about it by senators, and we have to assume that he will be,  said Borger, the network s chief political analyst.  He will say he never assured Donald Trump that he was not under investigation, that that would have been improper for him to do so. Comey s opening statement did, however, mention asserting that Trump was not under investigation, however the statement failed to specify whether Trump was not under criminal investigation, but only said there was no counter-intelligence investigation on the president.Read more: The Hill",politics,"Jun 8, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

BOOM! BRILLIANT ANDREW MCCARTHY Totally Destroys Any Case Against Trump [Video],"Andrew McCarthy is just awesome! He goes through the reasons why there is nothing on Trump at all. Tucker Carlson even says at the end of the interview that McCarthy should work in the White house I don t know a single person who works at the White House who can explain things the way you can. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAsy2ob28s0You have to love the common sense and brilliance of McCarthy. Here s a great McCarthy piece from the National Review:Finally, something else about those lawyers. I nearly fell out of my chair upon reading the very first paragraph of the notes of Clinton s interview, which identifies the lawyers for Clinton who were permitted to be present for the interview. Among them is Cheryl Mills, Clinton s longtime confidant and chief-of-staff at the State Department.Readers may recall that I suggested back in May that  the fix  was in in the investigation of the Clinton emails. The reason was that the Justice Department was allowing Cheryl Mills   a witness, if not a subject, of the investigation   to invoke attorney-client privilege on behalf of Mrs. Clinton in order to thwart the FBI s attempt to inquire into the procedure used to produce Clinton s emails to the State Department. Mills was a participant in that procedure   and it is the procedure in which, we now know, well over 30,000 emails were attempted to be destroyed, including several thousand that contained government-related business.When she worked for Clinton at State, Mills was not acting in the capacity of a lawyer   not for then-Secretary Clinton and not for the State Department. Moreover, as Clinton s chief-of-staff, Mills was intimately involved in issues related to Clinton s private email set up, the discussions about getting her a secure BlackBerry similar to President Obama s, and questions that were raised (including in FOIA requests) about Clinton s communications.That is to say, Mills was an actor in the facts that were under criminal investigation by the FBI. Put aside that she was not Mrs. Clinton s lawyer while working for the State Department; as I explained in the May column, Mills, after leaving the State Department, was barred by ethical rules from acting as Mrs. Clinton s lawyer  in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee. There is no way Mills should have been permitted to participate as a lawyer in the process of producing Clinton s emails to the State Department nearly two years after they d both left.I thought it was astonishing that the Justice Department indulged her attorney-client privilege claim, which frustrated the FBI s ability to question her on a key aspect of the investigation. But it is simply unbelievable to find her turning up at Mrs. Clinton s interview   participating in the capacity of a lawyer under circumstances where Clinton was being investigated over matters in which Mills participated as a non-lawyer government official.Read more: NRO",politics,"Jun 7, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

WINNING! TRUMP STOPS Obama-Era DOJ “Slush Fund” Payouts to Radical Groups,"Eric Holder was the king of extortion from big companies. He had it all figured out and was able to redistribute money from these  settlements  to the favorite radical group of the day. That this went on at our Justice Department is the height of hypocrisy.The Justice Department announced Wednesday it will no longer allow prosecutors to strike settlement agreements with big companies directing them to make payouts to outside groups, ending an Obama-era practice that Republicans decried as a  slush fund  that padded the accounts of liberal interest groups.In a memo sent to 94 U.S. attorneys  offices early Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he would end the practice that allowed companies to meet settlement burdens by giving money to groups that were neither victims nor parties to the case.Sessions said the money should, instead, go to the Treasury Department or victims. When the federal government settles a case against a corporate wrongdoer, any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,  Sessions said in a statement. This bill is oversight and action. Congress must not tolerate Justice Department political appointees using settlements to funnel money to their liberal friends,  Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who introduced the bill, said in a statement.HERE S OUR PAST REPORT ON THIS  SLUSH FUND :If you needed one more reason to think our government is like the Mafia  A slush fund scheme via the Department of Justice funneled billions of dollars to liberal activist organizations. The Department of Justice is the last place this should have happened but under Obama our government was turned into a radical fundraising apparatus for progressives. This has Eric Holder and Barack Obama s fingerprints all over it! Advocates for big government and progressive power are using the Justice Department to extort money from corporations. It s a shakedown. It s corrupt, pure and simple.    Tom Fitton, Judicial WatchHere s how it works: Remember when big banks were sued by the feds for supposed mortgage abuse or discrimination? The government basically extorted money from the banks and then incentivized the banks to settle by giving the money to third-party organizations. How convenient, right?  It was a way to redistribute billions to radical organizations like La Raza!So far, investigators have accounted for $3 billion paid to  non-victim entities . The underlying problem with the slush funds is we don t know exactly where the money is going. Using enforcement authority to go after corporate defendants, DOJ bureaucrats are taking billions away from taxpayers to fund their pet projects overriding congressional preferences.    Ted Frank, director of The Competitive Enterprise Institute Center for Class Action Fairness.

JAMES COMEY’S Bombshell Pre-Testimony Statement,"Read former FBI Director James Comey s full statement below:Statement for the Record Senate Select Committee on Intelligence James B. Comey June 8, 2017Chairman Burr, Ranking Member Warner, Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. I was asked to testify today to describe for you my interactions with President-Elect and President Trump on subjects that I understand are of interest to you. I have not included every detail from my conversations with the President, but, to the best of my recollection, I have tried to include information that may be relevant to the Committee.January 6 BriefingI first met then-President-Elect Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the President-Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.The Director of National Intelligence asked that I personally do this portion of the briefing because I was staying in my position and because the material implicated the FBI s counter-intelligence responsibilities. We also agreed I would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the President-Elect. Although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing, the FBI s leadership and I were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new President came into office uncertain about whether the FBI was conducting a counter-intelligence investigation of his personal conduct.It is important to understand that FBI counter-intelligence investigations are different than the more-commonly known criminal investigative work. The Bureau s goal in a counter-intelligence investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the United States or to steal our secrets. The FBI uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts. Sometimes disruption takes the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power. Sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked. Sometimes it involves  turning  the recruited person into a double-agent, or publicly calling out the behavior with sanctions or expulsions of embassy-based intelligence officers. On occasion, criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activities.Because the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known, counterintelligence investigations tend to be centered on individuals the FBI suspects to be witting or unwitting agents of that foreign power. When the FBI develops reason to believe an American has been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power, the FBI will  open an investigation  on that American and use legal authorities to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disrupted.In that context, prior to the January 6 meeting, I discussed with the FBI s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true; we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower, based on President-Elect Trump s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance.I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo. To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past. I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone)   once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions. I can recall nine one-on-one conversations with President Trump in four months   three in person and six on the phone.January 27 DinnerThe President and I had dinner on Friday, January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House. He had called me at lunchtime that day and invited me to dinner that night, saying he was going to invite my whole family, but decided to have just me this time, with the whole family coming the next time. It was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner, although I assumed there would be others.It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room. Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks.The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to. He said that lots of people wanted my job and, given the abuse I had taken during the previous year, he would understand if I wanted to walk away.My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI s traditionally independent status in the executive branch.I replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my ten-year term as Director. And then, because the set-up made me uneasy, I added that I was not  reliable  in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth. I added that I was not on anybody s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President.A few moments later, the President said,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.  I didn t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner.At one point, I explained why it was so important that the FBI and the Department of Justice be independent of the White House. I said it was a paradox: Throughout history, some Presidents have decided that because  problems  come from Justice, they should try to hold the Department close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work.Near the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis, Jeff Sessions, and many others. He then said,  I need loyalty.  I replied,  You will always get honesty from me.  He paused and then said,  That s what I want, honest loyalty.  I paused, and then said,  You will get that from me.  As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase  honest loyalty  differently, but I decided it wouldn t be productive to push it further. The term   honest loyalty   had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect.During the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.As was my practice for conversations with President Trump, I wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the FBI.February 14 Oval Office MeetingOn February 14, I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President. He sat behind the desk and a group of us sat in a semi-circle of about six chairs facing him on the other side of the desk. The Vice President, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of the National CounterTerrorism Center, Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and I were in the semi-circle of chairs. I was directly facing the President, sitting between the Deputy CIA Director and the Director of NCTC. There were quite a few others in the room, sitting behind us on couches and chairs.The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone. I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me. The last person to leave was Jared Kushner, who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me. The President then excused him, saying he wanted to speak with me.When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying,  I want to talk about Mike Flynn.  Flynn had resigned the previous day. The President began by saying Flynn hadn t done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify.The President then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information   a concern I shared and still share. After he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks, Reince Priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and I could see a group of people waiting behind him. The President waved at him to close the door, saying he would be done shortly. The door closed.The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying,  He is a good guy and has been through a lot.  He repeated that Flynn hadn t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said,  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.  I replied only that  he is a good guy.  (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would  let this go. The President returned briefly to the problem of leaks. I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock, making my way through the large group of people waiting there, including Mr. Priebus and the Vice President.I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership. I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. Regardless, it was very concerning, given the FBI s role as an independent investigative agency.The FBI leadership team agreed with me that it was important not to infect the investigative team with the President s request, which we did not intend to abide. We also concluded that, given that it was a one-on-one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related investigations. (He did so two weeks later.) The Deputy Attorney General s role was then filled in an acting capacity by a United States Attorney, who would also not be long in the role.After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed. The investigation moved ahead at full speed, with none of the investigative team members   or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them   aware of the President s request.Shortly afterwards, I spoke with Attorney General Sessions in person to pass along the President s concerns about leaks. I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened   him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind   was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply. For the reasons discussed above, I did not mention that the President broached the FBI s potential investigation of General Flynn.March 30 Phone CallOn the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as  a cloud  that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to  lift the cloud.  I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him.Then the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week   at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information, and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me,  We need to get that fact out.  (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.)The President went on to say that if there were some  satellite  associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadn t done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we weren t investigating him.In an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadn t brought up  the McCabe thing  because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe s wife) campaign money. Although I didn t understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person.He finished by stressing  the cloud  that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn t being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could.Immediately after that conversation, I called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had by then recused himself on all Russia-related matters), to report the substance of the call from the President, and said I would await his guidance. I did not hear back from him before the President called me again two weeks later.April 11 Phone CallOn the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I  get out  that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that  the cloud  was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel.He said he would do that and added,  Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.  I did not reply or ask him what he meant by  that thing.  I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended.That was the last time I spoke with President Trump.",politics,"Jun 7, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Prior to that, Rogers served as the Commander of the Tenth Fleet and Commander of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command.Rogers is a native of Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from New Trier High School in 1977. He is a graduate of Auburn University (1981) and the Naval War College.Rogers received his commission through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) program and has served in the United States Navy since graduating from Auburn University in 1981. He started his career as a Surface Warfare Officer working in naval gunfire support operations off Grenada, Beirut, and maritime surveillance operations off El Salvador. In 1986, he was selected for transfer from Unrestricted Line Officer to Restricted Line Officer and re-designation as a cryptology officer.During the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Rogers joined the military s Joint Staff, which works for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he specialized in computer network attacks. From 2007 onward he served as director of intelligence for the military s Pacific Command. In 2009, he became director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was subsequently named commander of U.S. Fleet Cyber Command and commander of the U.S. 10th Fleet, with responsibility for all of the Navy s cyberwarfare efforts. As such, Rogers was the first restricted line officer to serve as a numbered fleet commander and the first Information Warfare Community (IWC) officer to achieve the rank of vice admiral.In January 2014, the Obama Administration announced Rogers  nomination as director of the National Security Agency and the commander of the US offensive cyberoperations unit in the Department of Defense. Rogers succeeded General Keith B. Alexander, who served as the NSA director for nine years, and became the first IWC officer to achieve the rank of admiral. Although the NSA directorship does not require Senate approval, Rogers had to be confirmed by the Senate to head United States Cyber Command,[11] for which the Senate unanimously confirmed him.In his first public remarks as NSA director, Rogers stated that he believed that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was  probably not  working for a foreign intelligence agency, despite frequent speculation and assertion by the NSA s allies to the contrary. Rogers added:  He clearly believes in what he s doing. I question that; I don t agree with it. I fundamentally disagree with what he did. I believe it was wrong; I believe it was illegal. The Washington Post reported on 19 November 2016 that Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James R. Clapper Jr. had recommended to President Obama that Rogers be terminated as director of the National Security Agency. Carter reportedly recommended he be terminated due to poor performance, whereas Clapper considered it wise that the position be held by a civilian. Both Clapper and Carter had put Rogers on notice for poor performance in internal security and for a poor leadership style. His termination was reportedly delayed due to stalled changes to the bureaucratic structure of the intelligence community. Later, Rogers reportedly met with then President-elect Donald Trump without notifying his supervisors in what is an unprecedented action for a military officer. Trump was reportedly considering replacing Clapper with Rogers as DNI, however that position went to former Senator Dan Coats, with Rogers remaining NSA director.",politics,"Jun 7, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

“PRESIDENT TRUMP” IS STABBED TO DEATH In Central Park Production Of “Julius Caesar”…Where’s The Outrage?,"Take a look at @PublicTheaterNY's first Shakespeare in the Park production of 2017, a Trump-inspired Julius Caesar https://t.co/iTPiJMSSaq pic.twitter.com/t5VfDfZVRe  Playbill (@playbill) May 30, 2017In an interview with Mediaite, Laura Shaeffer   who saw a recent performance of the play, which opened May 23   said that the character of Julius Caesar in the Public Theater adaptation wears a business suit and has his hair styled in a manner similar to Trump s.Sheaffer added that the character of Calpurnia, Caesar s wife, speaks with a  Slavic accent  similar to that of First Lady Melania Trump.As happens at the end of the original play, the (Trump-inspired) Caesar is brutally stabbed to death by his associates in the Senate. Sheaffer said Caesar s death scene was particularly graphic, with blood  spewing everywhere,  and an American flag hanging overhead. To be honest I thought it was shocking and distasteful,  Shaeffer told Mediaite.  If this had happened to any other president   even as recently as Barack Obama or George W. Bush   it would not have flown. People would have been horrified. The Trump connection in the Oskar Eustis-directed production was not intended to be subtle, though the president is reportedly never referred to by name during the show.The actor playing Caesar, Gregg Henry (who also happened to play a caricature of Trump in Shonda Rhimes  ABC show Scandal), told Backstage in an interview last month that while the similarities between the Roman general and the current president don t always align exactly, there was still much to be gleaned from Trump s presidency and then injected into his portrayal of Caesar. The idea for me was to try and do some things that will represent and show you and I have great costumes and wigs that show you that this could be Trump,  Henry told Backstage. But I m also trying to bring in the larger knowledge of tyrants. It s sort of a  tyrant s  greatest hits  in [the way I play] the speeches and in the nature of the ego and belief that one man is more important, is above the law, is the law. Those tyrannical beliefs in terms of how to deal with power. For her part, Shaeffer told Mediaite that while she found the parallels between Trump and Caesar  fascinating,  the onstage murder of a character that so closely resembled Trump was a step  too far. I don t love President Trump, but he s the president. You can t assassinate him on a stage, she told the outlet.   BreitbartBy now, everyone knows how  comedian  Kathy Griffin expressed her opposition to our president, when she held his bloodied and decapitated head while making what turned out to be a career-ending video. So is this disgusting and violent behavior by the intolerant the left the new norm?

BREAKING: President Trump Makes FBI Pick One Day Before Comey Testimony [Video],"President Trump has nominated Christopher Wray to be the new director of the FBI. The president announced the pick in a tweet Wednesday:  I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow. #BREAKING  @POTUS nominates Christopher Wray for @FBI Director. #AmericaFirst   #MAGA pic.twitter.com/7reLeV2ZE8  Boston Bobblehead (@DBloom451) June 7, 2017This comes one month after President Trump fired James Comey:  While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,  Trump said in a letter to Comey.  It is essential that we find new leadership for the F.B.I. that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission. You are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately. Trump interviewed a slew of candidates for the position, including FBI director Andrew McCabe, former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, former FBI official Richard McFeely and John Pistole before settling on Wray.The interesting thing about the pick is that this was Trump s pick. This is also a brilliant move from the president to nominate a pick for FBI Director one day before Comey testifies.Christopher Wray was the lawyer for Chris Christie in the Bridgegate Investigation. The left will probably go bonkers over that fun fact.Here s a little more on Wray:Wray was nominated by President George W.

Inside the container is a 14-inch red rat snake, which strikes at the reaching girl.As the girl starts crying, a female voice in the background   identified by detectives as St. Laurent   starts to laugh.According to the charging affidavit, St. Laurent told deputies that she had grown up interacting with snakes and reptiles  of all sorts  with her father, and admitted that she allowed the girl to be bitten to teach her a lesson. As she has observed poisonous snakes, including coral snakes, at the property before, Chartelle St. Laurent elected to take the opportunity of finding the juvenile non-poisonous red rat snake to expose [the girl] to,  the report stated.St. Laurent claimed that she allowed herself to be bitten by the snake first in order to  ensure no injury would be caused  to the girl.  Indeed, the report noted that there were  no marks or injury  to the toddler.

IT’S A MIRACLE! Food Stamp Use Went Down 85% After This Change In Requirements,"Food Stamp use has miraculously gone down in several states! It s a miracle! In 13 Alabama counties, food stamp use went down a whopping 85%!When Obama took out the welfare-to-work requirement, the use of food stamps skyrocketed to nearly 45 million Americans! That s 1 in every 7 US citizens using food stamps! Now that the Trump administration has vowed to reduce the use, it s interesting to see that people jump off of assistance when the work requirement is put back in.Georgia and Alabama have seen a sharp decrease in food stamp use with the work requirement back in:Georgia:More than half of the 11,779 people enrolled for food stamps in 21 counties, an estimated 7,251 people, have dropped out of the food stamp program a drop of 62 percent, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.Georgia first rolled out its work requirements for the food stamp program in three counties in January 2016. Since then, the state has expanded work requirements in an additional 21 counties, giving people in those 21 counties until April 1, 2017 to find a job or lose food stamp benefits. Via: BNALABAMA:Thirteen previously exempted Alabama counties saw an 85 percent drop in food stamp participation after work requirements were put in place on Jan. 1, according to the Alabama Department of Human Resources.The counties   Greene, Hale, Perry, Dallas, Lowndes, Wilcox, Monroe, Conecuh, Clarke, Washington, Choctaw, Sumter and Barbour   had been exempt from a change that limited able-bodied adults without dependents to three months of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits within a three-year time frame unless they were working or participating in an approved training program.During the economic downturn of 2011-2013, several states   including Alabama   waived the SNAP work requirements in response to high unemployment. It was reinstituted for 54 counties on Jan. 1, 2016 and for the remaining 13 on Jan. 1, 2017. As of April 2017, the highest jobless rate among the 13 previously excluded counties was in Wilcox County, which reported a state-high unemployment rate of 11.7 percent, down more than 11 percentage points from the county s jobless rate for the same month of 2011.Ending the exemption has dramatically cut the number of SNAP recipients in the counties.As of Jan. 1, 2017, there were 13,663 able-bodied adults without dependents receiving food stamps statewide. That number dropped to 7,483 by May 1, 2017. Among the 13 counties, there were 5,538 adults ages 18-50 without dependents receiving food stamps as of Jan. 1, 2017. That number dropped to 831   a decline of about 85 percent   by May 1, 2017. Based on the trend, the number of (able-bodied adults without dependents) recipients for SNAP benefits is expected to continue to decline statewide and in the formerly 13 exempted counties,  according to Alabama DHR spokesperson John Hardy.Statewide, the number of able-bodied adults receiving food stamps has fallen by almost 35,000 people since Jan. 1, 2016. Each recipient receives about $126 a month in benefits.Nationwide, there are about 44 million people receiving SNAP benefits at a cost of about $71 billion. The Trump administration has vowed to cut the food stamp rolls over the next decade, including ensuring that able-bodied adults recipients are working.Via: al.com",politics,"Jun 6, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

The image, which was deemed offensive by the court, included answers such as  Yes, machine guns and hand grenades  and was shared by more than 500 people. One person who also shared the picture reported the elderly woman to the police.German newspaper reported that the woman was fined 1,350 euros because the image included negative comments about the so-called refugees.Jutta B. responded to her arrest, fine and death threats by saying:Following her arrest and the fine, the social media network suspended the woman s account. In court, Jutta said she shared and liked the image without properly reading it.

"“DRIVE THEM OUT OF YOUR PLACES OF WORSHIP!” London Imams Take President Trump’s Advice, REFUSE To Perform Funeral Rights For Islamic Terrorists [VIDEO]","President Trump gave a powerful speech to Arab leaders at the opening of the new Global Centre for Combatting Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 21, 2017. In his historic speech, President Trump warned Islamic extremists:  If you choose terror, your life will be brief and your life will be empty.  Trump went on to tell the Arab leaders and the entire world, We are not here to lecture and tell you how to live. We are here to work together to meet one goal and meet history s great test to conquer extremism. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence and innocent of hatred. Young Muslims should be able to build prosperity for themselves. This will be the beginning of the end for those who fight terror. This special gathering will one day be remembered as the start of peace in the Middle East and potentially all over the world. Watch the clip of President Trump telling Arab leaders in Riyadh and around the world to  drive out terrorism  from their nations and from their places of worship:It appears that the Imams in London were listening after East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre Chairman Muhammad Habibur-Rahman boldly announced to Muslims everywhere that if they commit acts of terror against innocent people, they will not receive funeral rights in London mosques.British police on Tuesday named the final member of the terror trio that murdered seven people on Saturday in a knife and van attack before police shot the jihadis dead   and the news comes as more than 130 Muslim religious leaders were refusing to say funeral prayers for any members of the ISIS cell.The decision by the Muslim leaders was seen as an  unprecedented  move because the funeral ritual is typically performed on a deceased Muslim no matter the person s past actions. The group of religious leaders have urged others to join them in declining to pray for the dead killers. We, as Muslim imams and religious leaders, condemn the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London in the strongest terms possible,  the Muslim leaders said in a statement.  Coming from a range of backgrounds, and from across the U.K.; feeling the pain the rest of the nation feels, we have come together to express our shock and utter disgust at these cold-blooded murders. We are deeply hurt that a spate of terror attacks have been committed in our country once more by murderers who seek to gain religious legitimacy for their actions. We seek to clarify that their reprehensible actions have neither legitimacy nor our sympathy. East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre Chairman Muhammad Habibur-Rahman said the decision was made because  those who perpetrate terrorism: you are against the very core teaching of Islam and of our Prophet Muhammad. Your misguidance will lead you to destruction, and God willing you will utterly fail in your evil aims,  he said in a statement.The decision underscores a warning President Trump issued to the Islamic world last month. Speaking in Riyadh before the leaders of 50 Muslim majority countries, Trump told warned terrorists that taking innocent lives would not lead to eternal paradise. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be fully condemned,  Trump said.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also applauded the move. He said he was encouraged by the imams and said that the decision means  they re condemning their souls  since the funeral prayer asks for forgiveness of the dead. And that is what has to be done,  he said.Youssef Zaghba, a Moroccan-born Italian man, was identified Tuesday morning as the final member of the trio that descended upon the London Bridge on Saturday.Mak Chishty, the Metropolitan police commander of engagement, said, according to The Guardian, that it is time for Muslims to  counter the scourge of terrorism, extremism and hatred that we have in our communities at present. Chishty, the highest-ranking officer in the department of Muslim faith, said,  It is the Islamic duty of every Muslim to be loyal to the country in which they live. We are now asking questions to understand how extremism and hatred has taken hold within some elements of our own communities.

Wishful thinking on O Donnell s part As much as they media would like it to be damaging for Comey to testify, Trump wins either way White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read out a statement to that effect on Monday, and O Donnell teased the clip as potentially  the beginning of the end. The video you re about to see might be the video that we re showing you years from now when we re pinpointing the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency,  O Donnell said. The president s power to assert executive privilege is very well established,  Sanders said.  However, in order to facilitate a swift and thorough examination of the facts sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee, President Trump will not assert executive privilege regarding James Comey s scheduled testimony. Comey, who Trump fired last month, will testify on Thursday in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He is expected to discuss his conversations with Trump, which included the president reportedly asking him to  let go  of the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.O Donnell said Trump was  politically unwise enough  to fire Comey but  not bold enough to tell that FBI Director to shut up.

"OOPS…MAINSTREAM MEDIA Won’t Show You This Video…London Citizens Yell: “DONALD TRUMP, WE LOVE YOU!”","London s Muslim Mayor has been pretending that ISLAM has nothing to do with the terror attacks that have gripped innocent citizens in the city of London the city that he was elected to represent. He wasn t elected to sugar-coat the obvious problem London has with Muslim extremism. He was hired to represent all citizens of London of every race and faith. So far, he has failed to make citizens of London feel any safer under his watch. In fact, his trashing of President Trump over his desire to take the appropriate measures to ensure the safety of American citizens is clearly not resonating with his constituents.Here s an example of a tweet where Mayor Sadiq Khan attempted to trash President Trump on May 10, 2017:  Following the second brutal attack during the month of Ramadan, London s Muslim Mayor talked about how angry he was that the  cowardly terrorists  attacked London citizens. Not once during his interview did Mayor Sadiq Khan mention the fact that the attackers screamed  Allah Akbar  and that they are MUSLIMS.WATCH:Here s how President Trump responded to the London Islamic terror attack:.A message to #WeThePeople from @POTUS #PresidentTrump #MAGA #mondaymotivation pic.twitter.com/LuORn0Ov6C   Jojoh888  (@jojoh888) June 5, 2017It shouldn t surprise anyone that Londoners are wishing they had a strong leader like President Trump, who s willing to stand up and say things that may be unpopular with the politically correct left, but nevertheless, need to be said.  President Trump has never been afraid to identify and speak out against the ISLAMIC extremist terrorists and has openly admitted that he is committed to doing whatever is necessary to keep our homeland safe.Watch Londoners yell,  We love you, Donald Trump! :Sadiq Khan is an EMBARRASSMENT  Londoners chant #Trump's name instead of hispic.twitter.com/flBWoTEKGN@realDonaldTrump #MAGA #LondonBridge  Boca Vista (@bocavista2016) June 5, 2017",politics,"Jun 5, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
TRUMP AIDE GORKA Calls Out Chris Cuomo for “Classic Fake News” [Video],"Chris Cuomo tries to argue with the brilliant Sebastian Gorka This is epic!The discussion began on the travel ban and devolved into CNN s rating and fake news Cuomo begins:  I explain it by you wanting to go with the original model to make it easier to pass because you were mimicking what  Obama did, and therefore masking your true intention was to not make it about travel, make it about Muslims. And as you well know, not just in your own rhetoric but the president s, he has said time and again that he thinks there s a problem with Islam and that he thinks that the Muslims may have a problem with us. As you know, with what we re seeing in the U.K. right now, attachment to the community of Muslims is so important, and the concern is that a move like this, trumpeted by the president in the midst of crisis in the U.K., sends an ugly message to our Muslim community here in the United States. Gorka responded with this awesome comment:  Well, unfortunately, what you ve just spun is classic fake news, Haha! The argument soon turned to one about CNN s ratings:GORKA: That s why your viewing figures are in the tank. CUOMO: No, actually we re up over 100 percent year over year. But don t let the facts get in your way. You re good at avoiding them. GORKA: Unless you re being mandatory in every airport in America, you re in the tank, Chris. CUOMO: We re up 100 percent year over year, Sebastian. What you said is foolishly wrong it s not just abusive of fact, but its silly with its own logic. CNN has benefited so greatly from the current dialogue and the demand for fact and testing power, that it is demonstrable by any metric you want to use. But I don t care about that. Let s put that to the side. GORKA: Chris, you re just comedy now. It s just comedy. CUOMO: You may think it s comedy, but I want to address things that really matter. GORKA: Getting two viewers instead of one is a 100 percent increase, Chris. You know that, right? CUOMO: Excuse me? GORKA: Getting two viewers instead of one is a 100 percent increase as well. CUOMO: That s not the numbers. Those aren t the numbers involved. But again, that s not the point. GORKA: Chris you re playing games. You re playing games. CUOMO: Good try. Good try. I give you points for that, Sebastian. Next time I see you, the meal is on me. GORKA: Good spin, Chris. CUOMO: But this isn t about CNN s success, because that s obvious.

PRESIDENT TRUMP’S REMARKS at Ford’s Theatre Gala Include Warning to Terrorists: “This bloodshed MUST end. This bloodshed WILL end” [Video],"PRESIDENT TRUMP and FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP attended the Ford s Theatre Gala tonight. President Trump vowed to protect America from terror:  We renew our resolve, stronger than ever before, to protect the United States and its allies from a vile enemy that has waged war on innocent life. And it has gone on too long. This bloodshed must end.

President Trump spoke of Abraham Lincoln and Ford s Theatre with heartfelt fondness.Ford s Theatre is administered and maintained by the National Park Service as a historic landmark, but it is also a working theater operated by the Ford s Theatre Society. The gala is a fundraising event for the FTS, whose purpose is to secure private financing for much of the theater s programming. It dates back to the Carter Administration.Traditionally, the President has hosted a pre-gala reception at the White House. However, the Obamas chose not to attend in 2015 or 2016, citing the death of Beau Biden and  scheduling conflicts  as reasons.

“CHICKEN LITTLE” AL GORE Uses Fear and the Bible to Push his Climate Agenda [Video],"Former VP Al Gore told ABC s George Stephanopoulos  weather reports are like the Book of Revelation from the Bible. Can you believe this grifter? You wonder if he really believes his lies!Stephanopoulos asked Gore about President Trump s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. He asked if it was significant, considering that former President George W. Bush did the same thing with the Kyoto treaty on climate change in 2001.Al Gore:  We lost a lot of time when the U.S. did not join the rest of the world community then, and while it is true that we have this sustainability revolution under way, and it s very exciting. It has the magnitude of the industrial revolution, but the speed of the digital revolution. We re still not changing fast enough. It s not just the scientific community warning us now. It s Mother Nature. Every night on the TV news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation 70 percent of Florida is in drought right now. Missouri just declared an emergency with another one of these historic climate-related downpours. Gore had the nerve to comment on President Trump s leadership:  We need presidential leadership. Since he s not going to lead, the American people are stepping up. The fact is that Al Gore is a grifter who has made millions off of the global warming scam! He s the ultimate grifter.

WOW! NEW Batch Of Emails Show Hillary’s State Department Was “CORRUPTION CENTRAL” For Obama Regime…Reveals Favors Huma Did For Clinton Foundation Insiders,"A nonprofit legal watchdog claimed Thursday that newly unearthed documents show Hillary Clinton sent and received more classified information on her private server than previously known, and that the papers also show top aide Huma Abedin did favors for Clinton Foundation insiders.Judicial Watch released more than 2,000 pages of documents it obtained pursuant to a May 5, 2015 court order, after filing a lawsuit against the State Department for failing to comply with a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.The new documents included 115 Clinton email exchanges that were not previously turned over by the State Department.According to Judicial watch, on Dec. 6, 2010, Clinton shared classified information with non-U.S. government employees Justin Cooper, an aide to former President Clinton, and Clinton Foundation Director Doug Band. The email allegedly shows Clinton instructing her aide to print the correspondence, which involved allegations of theft by Bangladeshi banker and Clinton Foundation donor Muhammad Yunus.Yunus was accused of embezzling $100 million from the Grameen Bank, which he founded.Judicial Watch s new emails appear to show multiple Abedin email exchanges from an unsecured server. They also appear to show that Clinton s then-scheduler, Lona Valmoro, forwarded Clinton s daily Secretary of State schedule to top Clinton Foundation officials, along with a  number of favors  that were requested.In a May 10, 2010 email between Abedin and Band, Abedin said she  hooked up  people from the Russian American Foundation with the  right people  at the State Department. The Russia-American Foundation was then staffed by Clinton political supporters, according to Judicial Watch.Additional documents allegedly show that Chelsea Clinton emails, an email sent by Clinton to Abedin saying she did not wish to fly on the same plane with former First Lady Michelle Obama to Betty Ford s funeral, and an email chain between Clinton staffers showing they drafted a  doctors statement  as to why Mrs. Clinton fainted due to  dehydration  causing her to hit her head and suffer a  concussion  in December 2012. Judicial Watch s email shows that the same group, including Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan and Philippe Reines, prepared a discharge statement when she was released from the hospital.

THIRD-RATE ACTOR Who Called His 11-Yr Old Daughter A “Rude Thoughtless Pig” Defends Liberal Pig “ISIS Kathy” Who Attacked Trump’s 11-Year Old Son,"Listen:After creating a video that included a vile, beheaded bloody head of President Donald Trump, the not-so-funny comedian Kathy Griffin has watched her career falling apart. In true liberal form, Griffin is blaming Donald Trump and his children for destroying her life, even though much of the outrage from the Trump children and his wife Melania was over Griffin s stated goal of wanting to  beat down  Trump s 11-year old son Barron.  Even CNN and CNN s Anderson Cooper, who once considered himself a friend of Griffins  have alienated themselves from the ISIS inspired comedian.  No worries though, the man who loves to impersonate Donald Trump on SNL, and who berated his own 11-year old daughter, actor Alec Baldwin has Kathy Griffin s back.The 59-year-old actor, who played President Donald Trump on last season of  Saturday Night Live, took to Twitter on Friday to defend Griffin amid the backlash over her controversial photo shoot. Kathy .baby I ve been there,  Baldwin wrote before referencing his own political drama in 1998, when he joked about then-Representative Henry Hyde on Late Night with Conan O Brien. The whole Henry Hyde thing w Conan, where we bring out an oxygen mask at the end? A joke,  he recalled.  That s what I thought. That s what we intended. No one walked out of the studio and said,  No, we re serious!  No one. But all your gutless, weasels in the GOP insisted I actually threatened Hyde. They played the victim beautifully.   FOX NewsSorry Alec but when you start making jokes about our current president being beheaded and actually create visuals to make your point that s when you cross the line from humor to inhumanity. Not that we care, but you re not doing your flailing career any favors by defending ISIS Kathy.",politics,"Jun 4, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

The president is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism, until he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States. The order barred entry for people from six Muslim majority nations, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the U.S. implements stricter visa screenings.The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals called the national security concerns an after-the-fact justification for a policy that was  intended to bar Muslims from this country. Rights groups that have been fighting the policy in the courts said the justices should not allow the travel and refugee bans to take effect. Again and again, our nation s courts have found that President Trump s Muslim ban is unconstitutional. We will continue to defend our plaintiffs  right to live free from fear of discriminatory treatment by the federal government,  said Karen Tumlin, legal director of the National Immigration Law Center.

ALARMING: NSA Refuses to Release Clinton-Lynch Tarmac Transcript with Lame Excuse,"If Clinton and Lynch just talked about grandkids then why is this such a top secret transcript? This is troubling because it portends to what we ve known all along Bill Clinton was meeting with Lynch to fight Hillary s battle. They won t reveal it because it would implicate so many people in government Are we right?A citizen researcher from Florida is attempting to have the recording of the infamous Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch tarmac tape released to the public, but apparently, the National Security Agency claims they won t release it due to  national security. The man researching and seeking to have the tape released is Florida orthodontist Larry Kawa. You may remember him because of Judicial Watch s filing of a lawsuit on his behalf to obtain a week s worth of Hillary Clinton s emails regarding Benghazi.It s being reported now that the NSA has declared the recording of the conversation that took place between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch in Phoenix, Arizona on June 27, 2016.Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request in March of this year to obtain the following:Any and all records and/or transcripts of a meeting held between Attorney General Loretta lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all references to the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton contained in day planners, calendars and schedules in the Office of theAttorney General. This brings us to Kawa. In an article at Big League Politics, Patrick Howley writes:The National Security Agency (NSA) blocked the release of a purported tape of Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch s private airplane talk with a rare legal justification used to protect top national security secrets.The NSA s block of the release of this information   citing one of President Obama s executive orders   undercuts Hillary Clinton s claim that her husband and Lynch had a  purely social  conversation about grandkids and golf on June 27, 2016, two weeks before Lynch dropped the Department of Justice investigation into Hillary Clinton s email scandal.Read more: Freedom Outpost",politics,"Jun 3, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

SEWER WORKER DIES After Muslim Doctors REFUSE To Help Him,"Such a compassionate faith Bring an 8-year old girl in for a clitorectomy and watch how quickly they sharpen the knives A Pakistani sewer worker died Thursday after doctors refused to treat him due to the fact he was  unclean. Irfan Masih, 30, went unconscious while cleaning a manhole in the city of Umerkot. He was taken to the hospital where he suffocated to death in front of doctors who refused to treat him because he was covered in sewer sludge. The doctors refused to treat him because they were fasting and said my son was  napaak (unclean),  Irshad Masih, the sewer worker s mother, told Pakistan s Express Tribune.Muslims across the world are currently observing the holy month of Ramadan, which requires them to abstain from eating, drinking and sex during daylight hours, but treating the worker does not appear to fall under these rules. Muslim medical professionals across the world frequently work with patients in all sorts of conditions during the holy month. -Daily Caller",politics,"Jun 3, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
PRO-TRUMP ROCKER #TedNugent Fires Back at Comparison to #KathyGriffin: “We’re talking apples and grenades”,"Ted Nugent isn t having it! He s being compared to Kathy Griffin by the left and he s had enough of it!We will never forget the night before the election at the very last rally for candidate Trump TED NUGENT WAS THERE AND PLAYED HIS HEART OUT!Conservative rocker Ted Nugent, who once told a concert crowd that Barack Obama should  suck on [his] machine gun,  says its unfair to compare him to embattled comedian Kathy Griffin.  There s no comparison whatsoever,  Mr. Nugent said during a radio interview Wednesday on  The Ben Ferguson Show,  The Washington Examiner reported.  We re talking apples and grenades here,  he said.  What Kathy Griffin did was downright vulgar, obscene, and a genuine variation of a death threat. I ve never threatened anybody.  Ms. Griffin is facing a wave of backlash for doing a graphic photo shoot holding a realistic mock severed head of President Trump. She has since apologized for the photos and had them removed, but lost her long-running New Year s Eve gig at CNN as a result. Despite his history of off-color comments, Mr. Nugent was invited to the White House in April for a dinner with Mr. Trump. Liberals in the media immediately compared Ms. Griffin s controversial stunt to Mr. Nugent s past comments, claiming there is a double standard.Mr. Nugent, who serves on the NRA s Board of Directors, reportedly told a concert crowd in 2007:  Obama, he s a piece of s . I told him to suck on my machine gun.  Speaking in 2012 at an NRA convention in St. Louis, he said,  We need to ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in November.  And in January of last year, he called for both Mr. Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to  be tried for treason & hung.

The accord was negotiated poorly by the Obama administration and signed out of desperation.

NANCY PELOSI Just Went After Trump’s Grandchildren And It’s Disgusting! [Video],"During Nancy Pelosi s remarks regarding President Trump s decision to pull out of the Paris Accord, Pelosi questioned whether President Trump s grandchildren breathe air! I kid you not! Can you imagine if a Republican had spoken like that about Obama s children? The snark coming from Pelosi is palpable RUDE! How is he [Trump] ever going to explain to his grandchildren what he did to the air they breathe? Assuming they breathe air. And I have to assume that is the case. We all do, right? Pelosi released a garbage statement after President Trump s announcement: San Francisco   Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued the following statement after it was reported that the Trump Administration will pull out of the landmark, 195-signatory Paris Climate Accord that would significantly slow the progress of global warming: President Trump s decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord is a stunning abdication of American leadership and a grave threat to our planet s future. In walking away from this agreement, the President is denying scientific truths, removing safeguards that protect our health and our environment, protecting polluters and their dirty energy agenda, and threatening our national and global security. The Paris Accord honors our collective moral responsibility to leave future generations with a planet that is clean, healthy and sustainable. The agreement deploys the full force of governments around the world to halt the rise in carbon emissions that cause extreme climate events, including record droughts, horrific famines and devastating floods, in addition to thousands of deaths each year from asthma attacks and other air pollution-related diseases. Rejecting the pact also sends a strong message to the marketplace to direct innovative, entrepreneurial investments in the clean energy economy elsewhere. The majority of Americans in both parties know that climate change is real, and want clear, decisive action to arrest its dire effects. Democrats will continue to support the strong action of states, cities and the private sector to halt the march of climate change, no matter how destructive and short-sighted the decisions of this Administration continue to be.

"RADICAL, INTOLERANT Students Held College Administrators HOSTAGE…And No One Cared [VIDEO]","Video from inside Evergreen State College continues to leak, showing that protesters had at one point held administrators hostage until they agreed to comply with their demands.The incident took place during the second day of demonstrations demanding the resignation of Professor Bret Weinstein, who angered many students when he challenged the school s decision to ask white people to leave campus for a day of diversity programming in an all-staff email.The protest began Tuesday morning when an angry mob of SJW s confronted Professor Bret Weinstein after he had sent an email to faculty and staff explaining his reasoning for opposing the demonstration.  Campus ReformWatch the hostage situation here:Now, Weinstein s reportedly been told to avoid campus because his safety is at risk. Police told me protesters stopped cars yesterday, demanding information about occupants,  Mr. Weinstein told The Washington Times.  They believe I was being sought. It appears that the campus has been under the effective control of protesters since 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. Police are on lockdown, hamstrung by the college administration. Students, staff and faculty are not safe.Having already accosted Weinstein with such vitriol that campus police suggested he leave campus because officers could not guarantee his safety, the students set their sights on the administration, confining school officials in an office until they capitulated to an ultimatum demanding various diversity-related initiatives. The priority is that they stay in that room. If they aren t in that room, then we did something wrong, so you all need to watch that door, watch all the doors, the windows, you need to keep eyes on them,  one protester commands, referencing all of the potential exit points that administrators could use to make an escape.  Somebody needs to go in that room real quick to make sure there s no way for them to leave. The video pans to a closed conference room leading to College President George Bridges  office, which is surrounded on the outside by dozens of student protesters who made it their stated mission to establish a  physical presence  outside the office to ensure that Bridges and his staff  aren t leaving. Shortly thereafter, one demonstrator emerges from Bridges  office and triumphantly informs her companions that Bridges  talked to the chief of police and he said police will not show up. The unidentified protester who was apparently leading the brigade then enters Bridges  office, where the president and several other administrators are seated around a table that is encircled by still more student protesters. The only priority is that y all stay in this space until those demands can happen so that s the only thing that we re concerned about,  the protest leader reiterates, though he assures the administrators that  everyone s safety and health is concerned,  and that food and water would be provided to them.At one point, Bridges explains that he needs  to pee,  to which one protester initially responds by sharply instructing him to  hold it,  though he was eventually escorted to a nearby bathroom by a team of protesters.Meanwhile, the crowd gathered outside continued to chant  hey, hey/ho, ho/these racist faculty have got to go. The student who said they talked to the police chief and that they would not be coming was lying. The police did show up to the hostage situation. The only problem is, the president of Evergreen College has already made a public statement saying that he has no interest in pressing charges against any of the hostage takers.When police arrived, presumably drawn by the uproar, the students fled to the library, where they barricaded themselves inside the Trans & Queer Unity Lounge and asked white students to patrol the halls for any police  intruders. At a meeting between the administration and students later that day, University President George S. Bridges quickly assured the crowd that no students would be punished for their involvement in the demonstrations and promised a  major reiew  of what happened and why.My brother.

EVERY BAD THING We Can Say Goodbye To With Our Exit From The Paris Accord,"The word  nothing-burger  has been tossed around so much lately but it s best used in referring to what the Paris Accord would do to change the climate. IT WOULD DO NEARLY NOTHING! If you heard President Trump s speech yesterday then you know this was one of the HUGE points within his remarks. The cost/benefit was so out of line and so unfair for America! It s safe to say that how much the accord would change climate is a nothing burger but the total loss to America would be HUGE!Here s a list from Breitbart News of the things you can say goodbye to now that our AWESOME President has removed us from the Paris Accord:Goodbye to  American Last.  The Paris agreement was basically an attempt to halt climate change on the honor system. Its only legal requirements were for signatories to announce goals and report progress, with no international enforcement mechanism. As a result, it was likely that the United States and wealthy European nations would have adopted and implemented severe climate change rules while many of the world s governments would avoid doing anything that would slow their own economies. The agreement basically made the U.S. economy and Europe s strongest economies sacrificial lambs to the cause of climate change.Industrial Carnage. The regulations necessary to implement the Paris agreement would have cost the U.S. industrial sector 1.1 million jobs, according to a study commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These job losses would center in cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining. Industrial output would decline sharply.Hollowing Out Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The industrial carnage would have been concentrated on four states, according to the Chamber of Commerce study. Michigan s GDP would shrink by 0.8 percent and employment would contract by 74,000 jobs. Missouri s GDP would shrink by 1 percent. Ohio s GDP would contract 1.2 percent. Pennsylvania s GDP would decline by 1.8 percent and the state would lose 140,000 jobs.Smashing Small Businesses, Helping Big Business. Big businesses in America strongly backed the Paris climate deal. In fact, the backers of the climate deal reads like a  who s who  of big American businesses: Apple, General Electric, Intel, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, General Mills, Walmart, DuPont, Unilever, and Johnson & Johnson. These business giants can more easily cope with costly regulations than their smaller competitors and many would, in fact, find business opportunities from the changes required. But smaller businesses and traditional start-ups would likely be hurt by the increased costs of compliance and rising energy costs.Making America Poorer Again. A Heritage Foundation study found that the Paris agreement would have increased the electricity costs of an American family of four by between 13 percent and 20 percent annually. It forecast a loss of income of $20,000 by 2035. In other words, American families would be paying more while making less.Much Poorer. The overall effect of the agreement would have been to reduce U.S. GDP by over $2.5 trillion and eliminate 400,000 jobs by 2035, according to Heritage s study. This would exacerbate problems with government funding and deficits, make Social Security solvency more challenging, and increase reliance on government s spending to support households.",politics,"Jun 2, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
EPIC! RAND PAUL Laughs at CNN’s Climate Hysteria…Schools Jake Tapper on Climate Truth [Video],"This is so good! Rand Paul knows his climate truth. Jake Tapper is totally embarrassed by the argument from Paul who tells Tapper and all liberals to knock off the hysteria on climate:  My goodness, the sky is falling  because the world is billions of years old and the most severe climate change events happened millions of years before the industrial revolution.  THE HYSTERIA IS EMBARRASSING BUT EXPECTED: You need to make sure that your viewers know that most of climate scientists  models have been wrong. They adjust it every year because they haven t been good at predicting things.   But obviously scientists have been predicting for years that the temperatures would go up, that glaciers would shrink, that sea ice would disappear, that oceans would rise, that the sea level would rise and there would be longer and more intense heat waves and all of that has happened, Senator,  ",politics,"Jun 2, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

GREAT JOB! WILBUR ROSS Destroys Pro-Paris Accord Argument With Brilliant Talking Points [Video],"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is one smart man when it comes to making an economic argument against the Paris Accord. He appeared on Neil Cavuto right before President Trump spoke and brilliantly discussed why we need to get out of this boondoggle that will drain America of trillions of dollars.

Steve Mnuchin is stepping up because he wants to help Donald Trump Make America Great Again. Fantastic!Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross was picked for Commerce Secretary. Does he need a boss? No! He s also doing this for all the right reasons!These two men are brilliant picks and have said they will coordinate and work to bring America roaring back.  Private sector nominees for these two positions couldn t be better!

OUCH! NEW EMAILS Show Hillary Didn’t Want To Fly In Same Plane As Michelle Obama,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton once requested to fly in a separate plane rather than share one with then-First Lady Michelle Obama, according to newly released emails.The email exchange was part of a new batch of emails that government watchdog Judicial Watch obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Clinton and her top aide, Huma Abedin, discussed in a July 2011 exchange Clinton s plans to attend the funeral of fellow former First Lady Betty Ford in Grand Rapids, Mich. Looks like plane won t be an issue,  Abedin wrote.  Also, looks like Michelle Obama also going. Is it ok [sic] that we and Mrs. O take two separate planes?  Clinton asked. I think it s ok [sic]. But let me see what kind of plane she s taking,  Abedin responded. I would rather have our own of course,  Clinton added.The new emails surfaced after other messages, ones released during the 2016 presidential campaign, revealed that Clinton and Obama s husband, former President Barack Obama, had an antagonistic relationship. And she HATES that the president ( that man,  as the Clintons call him) kicked her ass in 2008,  Democratic megadonor Jeffrey Leeds wrote to former Secretary of State Colin Powell in March 2015.  She can t believe it or accept it. Leeds also addressed the growing controversy over Clinton s use of a private email server at the State Department, writing that then-President Obama would not care if Clinton found herself in legal trouble. I don t think the president would weep if she found herself in real legal trouble. She ll pummel his legacy if she gets a chance and he knows it,  Leeds said.The exchange between Clinton and Abedin came after another message, one also released during the 2016 election, showed that Clinton complained commercial flights were  burdensome  and asked Abedin to get the Air Force to fly her from Westchester, N.Y. back to Washington, D.C.

"PRESIDENT TRUMP Blasts Phony Climate Change Crybabies: “I Was Elected to Represent the Citizens of Pittsburgh, Not Paris” [VIDEO]","With his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, President Trump just gave the #ResistTrump crowd a new reason to hate him. Meanwhile, his supporters can add another check mark in the  promised kept  category. We all know how rare it is for a politician to actually do what he promised he d do while campaigning for office. Now it s up to Trump supporters to make sure they have his back President Trump said he was elected to represent the citizens of  Pittsburgh, not Paris,  during remarks Thursday explaining his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. We want fair treatment for our taxpayers,  he said.  We don t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won t be. They won t be. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. Trump appeared to name-drop Pittsburgh because of its historic ties to the coal and manufacturing industries.However, Democratic Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto rejected Trump s words, saying his city would follow the guidelines of the agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions.  WFBThe mayor of Pittsburg, Bill Peduto, took to Twitter to show his opposition to and disrespect for our president who dodged a major bullet by his brave decision to not go along with the Paris Agreement:As the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future. https://t.co/3znXGTcd8C  bill peduto (@billpeduto) June 1, 2017Apparently not everyone who follows the radical mayor of Pittsburg agreed with his tweet.

President Trump Announces Decision on Paris Climate Deal…America First! [Video],"FOX News is announcing that President Trump believes the Paris Accord is a  bad deal  and wants to jeep his promise to put Americans first. We say Amen to that! This is another mess Obama got us into that President Trump has to get us out of! The statement from the President will be any moment:THIS IS A GLOBAL REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH and will hurt Americans!OUR PAST REPORT ON THIS ACCORD: John Kerry and Al Gore are jubilant that we ve struck a deal (sort of) to limit carbon emissions what a couple of jokesters these guys are. It s really embarrassing that all these important people came together to discuss the weather and NOT our most pressing topic of what to do about terrorism. This is what happens when you let the liberals rule unicorns and rainbows:John Kerry told fellow negotiators,  it will help the world prepare for the impacts of climate change that are already here and also for those that we already know are on our way inevitably.  He added the pact would  prevent the worst most devastating consequences of climate change from ever happening. A deal to attempt to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2C has been agreed at the climate change summit in Paris after two weeks of intense negotiations. The pact is the first to commit all countries to cut carbon emissions. The agreement is partly legally binding and partly voluntary. Earlier, key blocs, including the G77 group of developing countries, and nations such as China and India said they supported the proposals. President of the UN climate conference of parties (COP) and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said:  I now invite the COP to adopt the decision entitled Paris Agreement outlined in the document.  Looking out to the room I see that the reaction is positive, I see no objections. The Paris agreement is adopted. As he struck the gavel to signal the adoption of the deal, delegates rose to their feet cheering and applauding.John Kerry told fellow negotiators,  it will help the world prepare for the impacts of climate change that are already here and also for those that we already know are on our way inevitably.  He added the pact would  prevent the worst most devastating consequences of climate change from ever happening. Former U.S. vice president Al Gore says  years from now, our grandchildren will reflect on humanity s moral courage to solve the climate crisis. And they will look to December 12, 2015, as the day when the community of nations finally made the decision to act. South African environment minister Edna Molewa calls the pact  the best we can get at this historic moment.  She says it  can map a turning point to a better and safer world  but she added that developed countries still have to cut emissions more and help poorer nations to counter the effects of global warming.READ MORE: BBCRead more: AP",politics,"Jun 1, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

CHAOS BREAKS OUT AFTER ILLEGAL ALIEN TOWNHALL SHUTS DOWN: Antifa Thug Arrested and Unmasked [Video],"Chaos broke out after legal Americans and illegal aliens clashed at a town hall in California:The Los Angeles Times put their spin on what happened to make it seem as though  Trump supporters  were the trouble. They downplayed the Antifa anarchist in attendance and other pro-illegal people. It just didn t fit their narrative One of the other issues not addressed in the LA Times article is that these town halls have reportedly been used to teach illegals how to escape deportation and how to  work the system :  Anti-illegal protesters aka American tax payers have characterized it as teaching people who are in the country illegally how to avoid deportation and get federal benefits. Federal benefits and rights? They have no rights and shouldn t be getting ANY federal benefits! Notice how they call the illegal aliens  immigrants Congressman Holds Town Hall to  Explain  (Illegal) Immigrants  Rights:The majority of calls into Rep. Lou Correa s Orange County congressional office are about immigration worries and what the Trump administration s enforcement policies mean for Correa s many Latino constituents. There s a lot of fear in my district.  he said.So the freshman Democrat has held seven town halls, all focused on immigration and explaining immigrants  rights. They ve been peaceful, with representatives from groups such as the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) and the Mexican Consulate invited to help Correa answer questions.But as the crowd of about 100 people gathered at Santa Ana s Delphi Center on Tuesday evening, Correa knew this time would be different. We had some people there, probably a dozen of them, that immediately had signs that were not complimentary to yours truly,  he said.Two women arguing about immigration issues had already gotten into an altercation outside the town hall. They were cited for assault and battery, and barred by police from going inside.Correa told the crowd inside he would give a short presentation about immigration policy coming out of Washington, and then have a question-and-answer session.About a dozen people were having none of it. Some of the most tense moments came when Correa started talking about green card holders who served in the U.S. military and have since been deported. Ma am, I m trying to be courteous here,  he said as a woman kept speaking over him. As soon as I started speaking, it became very clear they were not going to let me speak,  Correa said Wednesday.  They just got louder and louder. Video of the town hall posted on social media shows people in the crowd yelling  Americans first  and  illegals have no rights. Correa repeatedly asks them to let him speak.  Are you guys going to cooperate, or am I going to have to ask you to leave?  he said.About 15 minutes in, as some in the crowd continued to shout and their attention turned to berating a group of counter-protesters, Correa declared the meeting over.",politics,"May 31, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Yes, these are the people we re dealing with. Let s hope they finally get to the bottom of SOMETHING The Washington Examiner reports:The House Intelligence Committee has issued seven subpoenas as part of its ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including one seeking information about Obama s former national security adviser Susan Rice, and her activities related to intelligence documents that named members of the Trump campaign.The Journal s report said the intelligence-related subpoenas are to  seek information on requests  for the unmasking of names by Susan Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan, and United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power.Having subpoenas directed at former members of the intelligence committee could show that Republicans have strengthened their resolve to track down leaks from within the intelligence gathering agencies, such as the leak that described the contents of a phone call between Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.Susan Rice has been a target on the unmasking for some time so this should be very interesting.

BOMBSHELL CASE: Illegal Alien Voting Cover-Up Exposed as Virginia Governor Blamed for Thousands Casting Ballots,"Thank goodness for President Trump s new commission because the latest finding on voter fraud is just the tip of the voter fraud iceberg:HERE S WHAT S GOING ON:When Maureen Erickson registered to vote in Prince William County, she listed her home address as a street in Guatemala, in what should have been a very strong indication that she wasn t a regular Virginia resident. Yet she remained on the voting rolls for years, and even cast ballots in 14 different elections, up through the 2008 presidential contest. She was only purged in 2012, just ahead of the election, after she self-reported as a noncitizen, according to a new report released Tuesday by the Public Interest Legal Foundation. Ms. Erickson was one of more than 5,500 noncitizens who were registered to vote in Virginia this decade, and were only bumped from the rolls after they admitted to being ineligible. Some 1,852 of them even managed to cast ballots that were likely illegal, though undetected, the PILF, a conservative voter integrity group, said in its report. Just as troubling, the PILF said, was Virginia s efforts to try to hide the information from the public   a problem foundation President J. Christian Adams said began at the very top, with Gov. Terry McAuliffe.  At the instruction of Governor McAuliffe s political appointees, local election officials spent countless resources to prevent this information from spilling into the open,  Mr. Adams said in a statement releasing the report.  From NoVa to Norfolk and all urban and rural points in between, alien voters are casting ballots with practically no legal consequences in response.  READ MORE: WTNEW REPORT:A new report released shortly after the forming of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity finds that more than 5,000 individuals were determined to be non-U.S. citizens registered to vote in Virginia. Dubbed a  sequel  to a similar 2016 effort, the latest study found 5,556 voters were  quietly removed  from the records for reasons related to non-citizenship  between 2011 and May 2017,  according to an advanced look at the findings provided by the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF). Of the total registered, one-third of unlawful voters managed to cast ballots leading to a total of more than 7,400 illegal votes cast, according to the report.The organization points out that it was unable to find any evidence that illegal registrations or votes were ever prosecuted.The report details how ineligible individuals are slowly discovered by local officials most often, the authors allege, by accident. Applicants for voter registration are not required to prove they are actual U.S. citizens in Virginia. The vast majority of states only require that people claim to be citizens during registration, PILF notes. The report details, however, that Virginia shares information when a claimed citizen indicates otherwise to a separate state agency. At that point, removal procedures begin:In the absence of regular data-sharing arrangements between federal officials and the Commonwealth, the ability of election officials to identify aliens on the voter rolls is almost nonexistent.The most that happens in Virginia is that an alien on the voter rolls will sometimes tell the state DMV they are not a citizen. Without those leads, counties and municipalities must accept false claims of citizenship on their face.The authors also shared with this reporter examples of how some ineligible noncitizens admitted their immigration statuses at the outset, but were still registered to vote. Some illegal registrants lasted on the rolls for years risking possible deportation until they were discovered.Read more: Breitbart",politics,"May 31, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Trump s tweet also reminded Griffin that he has an 11-year old son who has the ability to see her disgusting depiction of his father s bloodied, decapitated head:Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!  Donald J.

"RUSH LIMBAUGH: This Group is “Roadblocking” Trump More Than Any Other With Approval of Over 75,000 Refugees This Year!","Rush Limbaugh nails it in the transcript below but the most disturbing part of the  roadblocking  of Trump is that the refugee resettlement program is to be funded/ expanded  by Congress for fiscal year 2018 and there is  a desire for over 75,000 refugees from mostly Muslim countries THIS year:Republicans in Congress funded the US Refugee Admissions Program at a level for 75,000 refugees to be admitted by September 30th (the last day of this fiscal year):U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  has begun to expand its interview schedule in the 3rd quarter of the fiscal year,  public affairs officer Marilu Cabrera told HuffPost in a statement on Friday. The Department of Homeland Security is working with the State Department to plan for a  further expansion  through the end of fiscal year 2017, she added.We ve immigrated mostly Muslim refugees since 9/11!Pew: More Muslims Than Christians by 2100Why are we continuing down this path when it s a better solution to keep them in safe zones in their own country? This solution was even proposed by President Trump! Small towns across America are being forever changed by the HUGE influx of Muslims. Please see our latest on this below the Rush Limbaugh transcript.Rush Limbaugh let it rip on the Republicans yesterday with his concern that it s the Republicans who are  roadblocking  the Trump agenda:Transcript:I don t understand how people don t get that it s not just the Democrats in Washington that are roadblocking Trump. I mentioned it earlier.Mitch McConnell says he can t see a way to getting 50 votes for the House Obamacare repeal bill? Now, stop and think here, folks. Back when the only element that we had was the House of Representatives and Republican voters were constantly saying,  Why aren t you doing more to stop Obama? Why aren t you trying to do something to stop Obamacare?  The answer was always,  Well, all we ve got is the House. W-w-we can t get anything through the Senate because the Democrats own the Senate. Obama s in the White House! He ll veto anything if it did make it there. So voters gave Republicans the Senate, and Mitch McConnell said,  Well, the first thing you have to know is it takes 60 votes to do anything in the Senate, and we don t have 60 votes. We only have 52.  And then he would add,  Plus, as long as Obama s still in the White House, all this is academic anyway. He s gonna veto whatever we pass.  So we gave the Republicans the White House and elected Trump. Now the latest story  There s a Wall Street Journal story. You know, I had this sort of cram last night after getting back from being away two days.I saw a Wall Street Journal story about how the Republicans in the House, they just can t! It s just impossible. They re pulling their hair out. They don t know what to do. They just can t find a way to cut any taxes. Because every time they cut a tax over here, they have to find a way to make the money up over there, and they just can t. They re looking at all these various tax cuts proposals and they said,  I   I   I don t know how we re gonna pay for all this. So the Republican Party, which is ostensibly the party of the president   and they owe their majority to him, particularly the Senate   are roadblocking Donald Trump more than the Democrats are, because the Democrats cannot. The Democrats don t have the votes in the House to stop Trump. The Democrats don t have the votes in the Senate to stop Trump, although there is the 60-vote cloture requirement. It s not the Democrats standing up and saying,  We are not gonna help. We re gonna stand in the way of any foolish tax cut you propose. It s the Republicans standing up and saying,  I just don t see how we re   there s no room here. I don t know how we re gonna lower rates when you have this exemption over here and you have this exemption there.  And I just read this stuff and I shake my head. They don t want to cut taxes. Either they don t want to cut taxes institutionally, they don t want to cut taxes economically, or they just don t want to do the heavy lifting. I don t know what it is. My guess is they don t want to help Trump.Now, you would think Trump figures this out, but he doesn t give any evidence of it. Like he tweeted something:  U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes immediately and get health care and tax cuts approved fast and easy. Democrats would do it no doubt.  He s talking about getting rid of the 60-vote requirement to shut off debate and just go to simple majority on every bill. Does he know that it s the Republicans that are the roadblock here? He has to know, and certainly if he s got people around him who know.Now, I could understand if he doesn t want to go public and start an internecine battle between the White House and the Republicans on Capitol Hill, you know, keep that for back channels and behind the scenes. The Wall Street Journal had a picture of the chairman of Ways and Means Committee and Paul Ryan standing there and all these guys and the headline:  Republicans Find Yet Another Way to Cut Taxes on the Rich. They just don t see how they can do it. It s incredible. It really is incredible. Because, of course, there s a way. They just don t want to do it. I think it s all establishment, all the time anti-Trump, throw the media in there as well. But even in the middle of this I can tell you almost assuredly that Trump is not off his game. He s not despondent. He s not sitting there worried about why all these people hate him. He s not worried about all that. He s just head down and moving ahead full speed as he can, not reacting or responding to all this stuff in the media, except when he tweets.REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT CONTINUES! Congress approved funding for the refugee resettlement program! This is NOT good news and is shocking to see that they are keeping the pipeline going on bringing mostly Muslim refugees to America. You have to ask why they continue to ignore this failed boondoggle that the American taxpayers fund each year:It is because most of them work for their big business donors and the Chamber of Commerce to guarantee a steady supply of cheap immigrant labor! Adding insult to injury, your tax dollars support refugee families through the welfare system because wages are too low! You pay for the importation of the labor and for the laborers  support once here!It is really quite a difficult obstacle for us (who wish to see the USRAP reformed) to overcome big businesses and global corporations pushing cheap labor in conjunction with so-called  religious  charities (paid by taxpayers!) claiming this is all about humanitarianism while essentially acting as  head hunters  for big business.Here s HuffPo s latest on the pipeline flowing:The United States appears to be resuming its longstanding efforts to resettle refugees after the program was derailed and almost completely upended abroad for several months.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  has begun to expand its interview schedule in the 3rd quarter of the fiscal year,  public affairs officer Marilu Cabrera told HuffPost in a statement on Friday. The Department of Homeland Security is working with the State Department to plan for a  further expansion  through the end of fiscal year 2017, she added.",politics,"May 31, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

WINNING! GEORGE SOROS Group Gets Black Eye When Hannity Advertiser Comes Back After Allegedly Pulling Ads Over Seth Rich Story,"The USAA financial services firm is reinstating its advertising on Sean Hannity s Fox News Channel program after receiving heavy criticism for its initial decision from many of the military members and veterans that it serves.The San Antonio, Texas-based company said Tuesday it will also start advertising again on other programs where it had suspended ads, including  Hardball  and  The Rachel Maddow Show  on MSNBC, and Jake Tapper s  The Lead  on CNN.Following Hannity s reporting on (what the AP calls a discredited conspiracy theory) involving the death of a Democratic National Committee staff member, the liberal advocacy group Media Matters last week posted a list of his show s advertisers   and USAA was one of 10 to say it was pulling its commercials. At the time, the USAA said the company s policy was to avoid politically opinionated shows.But many of USAA s customers reacted angrily, and it didn t help when the company s advertising on other opinion shows was pointed out.USAA said it wasn t trying to favor one set of political views over another. We heard concerns from many members who watch and listen to these programs,  USAA said in a statement on Tuesday.  Our goal in advertising has always been to reach members of the military community who would benefit from USAA s well-known commitment to service. Today, the lines between news and editorial are increasingly blurred. The advertising is returning while the company reviews its policy about avoiding the opinion shows.Hannity was due to return to Fox Tuesday following a brief vacation. He had said he would no longer talk about the shooting death of Seth Rich last year following pleas from the man s family, although his network had retracted an online story about Rich because it hadn t met its reporting standards.Brent Bozell, president of the conservative Media Research Center, said he wasn t surprised by USAA s decision,  given the avalanche  of protests. His group was behind mobilizing that backlash, and said its members generated more than 1,600 phone calls to USAA within 48 hours.

WHY IT’S GOOD NEWS For Conservatives That Bitter Hillary Can’t Shut Up About Losing [VIDEO],"As a Wellesley graduate, I was shocked and dismayed by Hillary Clinton s commencement address. Actually, that is #FakeNews. I was neither shocked nor dismayed by Mrs. Clinton s speech (but I did graduate from Wellesley   with honors!) It was exactly the kind of self-pitying, leaden and all-about-me performance that I would have expected from the entitled former Democrat candidate and now sore loser.Watch a few of Hillary s greatest hits during her commencement speech at Wellesley College:Also, it revealed this: Hillary hasn t learned a thing. As her friend Mike Bloomberg recently told an audience of Harvard Business School grads   Hillary lost the election because she had absolutely no message. She still doesn t.In addition, she is utterly lacking in self-awareness. She spoke at length about what she sees as a  full-fledged assault on truth and reason,  telling the graduating seniors that  the future of America, indeed the future of the world, depends on brave, thoughtful people like you insisting on truth and integrity right now every day.  This, from a woman who ran for our nation s highest office while distrusted by nearly two-thirds of the country, with good reason.As long as Mrs. Clinton and her loyalists blame James Comey, Vladimir Putin, sexism and the alt-right for her loss, Democrats will never rebuild their bridges to the working class Americans who elected Donald Trump.In her remarks, Hillary criticized  people    aka Trump followers, presumably   on social media for  sowing division at a time when we desperately need unity,  and then proceeded to give a highly partisan and divisive speech.Did she ever consider that there might be families in the audience who voted for her opponent? That they might not enjoy her taking veiled potshots at President Trump, and that this was their daughters  day too?Echoing the liberal media, Hillary went after President Trump through innuendo and clich s, talking about the dangers of fomenting fear and of  alternative facts.  Good thing there was no Q&A; someone might have wanted further clarification of how she came under sniper fire in Bosnia, or how a video caused the Benghazi attack or how the Monica Lewinsky scandal stemmed from a  vast right-wing conspiracy  and not Bill Clinton s unruly libido.Hillary trod dangerous pathways as she remarked,  when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society.  She is correct, of course, but a cursory review of her multiple dodges and lies about her mishandling of classified information and efforts to destroy evidence reveals a woman who fully earned her low trustworthiness ratings from Americans.The election is over, but Hillary cannot let it go. This is good news for Republicans. As long as Mrs. Clinton and her loyalists blame James Comey, Vladimir Putin, sexism and the alt-right for her loss, Democrats will never rebuild their bridges to the working class Americans who elected Donald Trump.Hillary Clinton missed an opportunity at Wellesley. She could have delivered a message of unity, and helped our anxious country begin to heal. Her followers need to see her putting country above politics; they need to see her as she briefly appeared at the inauguration, supporting the peaceful and legitimate transfer of power. Apparently, that is just too heavy a lift for Mrs. Clinton. She is happier nursing her wounds, and continuing to inflict them on the country.The former First Lady could also have talked about the dramatic changes taking place in our economy, and how women are thriving as entrepreneurs. She could have talked about the founders of Rent the Runway, or Sarah Blakely, who created Spanx, or Essie Weingarten, who bet her life s savings on a new idea and created a nail polish empire sold to L Oreal in 2010. These women are inspirational; they didn t shatter glass ceilings, they ignored them. It is true we need women in politics, and running NGOs, but we also need women making money and boosting the economy. That s where the funding for free college tuition and refugee services comes from   a lesson Hillary may never have learned.The New York Times tells us that the students cheered Mrs. Clinton  thunderously.  Of course they did. They have been weaned on courses like  Love and Intimacy  in the Women s and Gender Studies department or  Changing Gender Constructions in the Modern Middle East  in the History Department. There s nothing wrong with those studies, unless they crowd out learning how the progressive policies of Bernie Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have failed in France, for instance, leading to a stagnant economy with few opportunities for progress. Or how capitalism has delivered billions from poverty, including in Communist China, where the growth miracle of recent decades was facilitated by policies that encouraged entrepreneurship and private enterprise.Hillary Clinton missed some history lessons too, apparently. She alluded to Nixon s presidency which  would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice.  That isn t true, of course; Nixon resigned from office. It was her husband Bill who was impeached. Amazing she would get that wrong, in delivering what was sure to be a much-reviewed address. Maybe a little too much of that Chardonnay, Mrs. Clinton?

MELANIA TRUMP Proves ‘Dressing Well Is The Best Revenge’ To Designers Who Wouldn’t Dress Her,"If you weren t convinced of the fabulousness of First Lady Melania Trump before her 9-day foreign trip, you re certainly aware now. Not only did she dress impeccably but it was obvious that this wise woman put so much thought into what she would wear on this overseas trip. Who wasn t proud to see our beautiful and smart First Lady in appropriate and stylish outfits every day. She won us over in a big way and made the designers who refused to dress her look like schmucks. She needs no one to hold her hand to put together a wardrobe If anything, First Lady Melania Trump proved to the naysayers that you can be beautiful AND smart Well done!Richard Johnson of the New York Post: Melania Trump is proving to the fashion designers who said they wouldn t help her that dressing well is the best revenge.The first lady s trip to Saudi Arabia, the Vatican, Belgium and Sicily   wearing mostly Dolce & Gabbana   was a fashion tour de force that has forced many naysayers in the rag trade to rethink.The list of designers who said they wouldn t dress Melania is long, led by Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs, Zac Posen, Christian Siriano and Sophie Theallet.But Melania has managed to look smashing in dozens of different ensembles, from her white Ralph Lauren jumpsuit on election night to the D&G 3-D floral coat she wore in Sicily on Friday.Defending the former model against critics who harped on the garment s $51,500 cost, the Washington Post s Robin Givhan opined,  Frankly, the floral coat is beautiful. Givhan gets that Melania Trump is one smart woman who coordinated her fashion according to the place she was visiting:Givhan reported:  Clothes can be deeply symbolic. And Trump s choice of Dolce & Gabbana   an Italian brand that has been deeply inspired by Sicilian culture   for a trip to Sicily makes sense. Gabbana also has been quite vocal and enthusiastic in his willingness to associate his brand with the first lady There is a softening, a melting,  stylist Phillip Bloch told me.  Fashion people are fickle and fake. They are starting to see she is a beautiful woman who is married to the president, and it is an honor to dress her. Deliveries to Trump Tower have picked up.  Most days, the lobby is brimming with wardrobe boxes delivered for Melania,  a source told me.  Once she tries on the outfits and decides what she will keep, the boxes come back downstairs. Not since Jacqueline Kennedy has there been a first lady who needs less help. She doesn t need couture. She can buy off the rack, and it looks beautiful,  Bloch said.  She knows her size, and she knows what works on her. She luxuriates in minimal.

HILLARY APPEARS Wearing “Anti-Seizure” Sunglasses (Again) In Memorial Day Parade,"Remember when experts came out after Hillary collapsed following her visit to the 9-11 memorial in NYC and revealed that the odd blue-colored sunglasses Hillary was sporting that day are used by epileptic patients to avoid having a seizure.Who could forget Hillary s bizarre collapse that day, when her legs began to buckle and secret service agents grabbed her arms and threw her into the vehicle. It was almost as though the people around Hillary were well practiced in how to toss her into the vehicle before the cameras could catch her having a seizure only months before the election.Watch: Infowars   Hillary was seen wearing the blue sunglasses during the 9/11 memorial in New York City where she later collapsed from complications stemming from her numerous health issues.Given her lack of fashion concerns   she s regularly seen wearing pantsuits everywhere she goes   it s unlikely her blue sunglasses were meant as a fashion statement.Epileptic patients often wear Zeiss Z1 blue lenses in particular because they are effective at treating photosensitive epilepsy.

POLICE REFUSED To Believe German Man’s Emergency Call Saying Girlfriend Was Being Raped By Refugee With Machete While Camping,"The ban, which also applies to women and children and elderly relatives from war torn countries, has been put in place for two years after the country revealed the crisis will cost  37bn in 2017.Now just days after the Bundestag voted to speed up deportation and mandatory finger printing, it s emerged they have outlined the country needs 300,000 people a YEAR for the next 40 years to stop population decline.  Express UKA major shake up is underway in Germany after police refused to take seriously a 999 call from a young man who called in to say his girlfriend was being raped yards from him.The officer who took the call did not believe the desperate man on the other end of the line, and said:  You are not messing with me I hope? The terrified boyfriend had been threatened with a machete when the Ghanaian refugee entered the tent he shared with his girlfriend at a campsite near Bonn and told to remain where he was.But the boyfriend had a hard time getting police to take him seriously. Hmm,  was the first reaction from the female police officer on the line.  Where exactly is this rape happening?  she added.The man was forced to watch as the attacker violated his 23-year-old partner   and the police never arrived.The 26-year-old boyfriend eventually scooped her up and began walking with her along a main road looking for help.He called police a second time   and again they did not take their account of what happened at face value.Finally, nearly 30 minutes later, officers arrived and the victim was taken to hospital.Frank Piontek, spokesman for the Bonn Police, conceded that the  incoming official in the control centre, after our findings, did not initially correctly categorize the circumstances of the first call and reacted inappropriately in her language. The second call was also not handled properly, he added, saying a major review of procedures is underway following the attack in April.A photofit picture of the attacker led to his arrest and DNA testing confirmed his guilt.A CD player he stole from the tent was found at his refugee centre.He tried to flee when police moved in to arrest him, flinging a rucksack at one officer.It turned out that the backpack was stolen from a barbecue party shortly before the rape occurred.  Daily MailWelcome to the violent new Germany, thanks to Chancellor Angela Merkel, the woman who snubbed President Trump on his recent visit over his views on tightening immigration into America from terror nations, as he bravely stands in the face of liberal opposition determined to protect the safety of United States citizens.

“I’LL PUT A BULLET IN YOUR HEAD!” Scuffle Breaks Out Between TX Legislators After GOP Rep Calls ICE On Angry Illegal Aliens Who Crashed Chambers To Protest Sanctuary Cities Ban [VIDEO],"AUSTIN   A shoving match and war of words nearly turned into a fistfight on the Texas House floor Monday, the final day of a bitterly contentious 140-day legislative session. This session has been very, very difficult,  said Rep. Celia Israel, D-Austin.  There are enough of us here who remember a time in Texas when respect and decorum ruled the day. Those rules flew out the House door when a group of protesters crashed the chamber s gallery Monday, chanting opposition to the so-called sanctuary cities ban. Legislators approved a bill this year that would force local governments to enforce federal immigration laws, what opponents call a show-me-your-papers law.Angry illegal aliens flooded the Texas State Capitol building.

MSNBC “ANALYST” Shocks Host When He Makes Outrageous Claim About Jared Kushner: “That’s a major allegation. I mean that’s kind of a stretch” [Video],"Naveed Jamali is supposed to be a professional analyst on MSNBC but we re guessing that s just too much to ask of these news hacks. He makes the claim that Jared Kushner is a double agent for the Russians! He goes on to make claims about others in the Trump administration with ZERO evidence! To say this is way past crazy is an understatement! The liberal media must have all gotten their orders to saturate the airwaves with horrible lies about Trump s inner circle. This is dangerous stuff because there is no evidence at all but people will come away with a tainted view of Kushner no matter what happens.Jamali:  You look for patterns and this is a clear pattern emerging. It s a pattern that shows a consistent effort to deceive. And when you have that, there s only one conclusion you can draw, again from an intelligence standpoint that this man (Jared Kushner) was either a Russian agent, either aspiring to be a Russian agent or was in fact a Russian agent.Ruhle:  Hold on, this man being Jared Kushner? You really think he wants to be a Russian agent? Why would he be a Russian agent? That s a major allegation. I mean that s kind of a stretch, This is bonkers!

"TRUMP EFFECT? ONLY DAYS AFTER MEETING With President Trump, Pope Francis Delivers SURPRISING Message To Italian Workers","Flashback to February 18. 201: In a remarkable dispute just two days before a pivotal Republican primary, Pope Francis said Donald Trump s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is un-Christian, prompting Trump to respond that it was  disgraceful  for the pope to question his religion. A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian, Francis told reporters Wednesday aboard the papal plane. This is not in the Gospel. The pope s comments were first made public on Thursday. They obviously got to the pope,  Trump said.  He doesn t know me   the Pope heard only one side of the story. In response to Pope Francis  comments, candidate Trump told his supporters that I am a Christian and I am proud of it,  and also attacked the Mexican government for  using the pope as a pawn. There can t be a good economy without good businessmen, without their capacity to create and to produce,  he said, shattering his reputation as an enemy of the free market economy.The Pope recognized that the essential value of work and employment is only possible when companies are sound and successful. Moreover, only an economically healthy society can keep a democracy afloat, he suggested. The world of work is a human priority,  Francis said,  and it s also a priority for the pope. There s always been a friendship between the church and work, starting with Jesus, who was a worker. When work is weakened, it s democracy that enters into crisis,  he said.  There s a social compact. Without denouncing unemployment benefits, Francis insisted that state intervention wasn t a real solution.  A monthly check from the state that allows you to keep the family afloat doesn t solve the problem. It has to be resolved with work for everyone,  he said.",politics,"May 28, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

"PLOT THICKENS: D.C. POLICE CHIEF Who Oversaw Seth Rich Murder Socialized With Top Democrats, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz","More and more evidence is revealed every day, that points to the real possibility that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the person who leaked the DNC emails to Wikileaks, and that there is an all-out effort to cover it up, or completely dismiss it as a  tin-foil hat  theory by social media platforms, the leftist media and the Democrat Party. Twitter just suspended the WND account for posting a story that suggested disgraced DNC chief and top Democratic strategist Donna Brazile may have interceded in the Seth Rich murder investigation. In the WND exclusive story titled:Alicia Powe and Liz Crokin wrote the story that was also posted to and deleted from the social media platform by Twitter: Former Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile is the high-ranking DNC representative who allegedly called police and the family of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich and demanded to know why a private investigator was  snooping  into Rich s death, the private eye revealed to WND Monday. The high-ranking DNC official that called the police after I inquired about Rich s case was Donna Brazile,  veteran homicide detective Rod Wheeler told WND.  Why shouldn t I reveal who it was? Brazile, who was also a CNN contributor and a Hillary for America donor at the time, was caught providing Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton with questions that would later be asked of Clinton at a televised CNN town hall. In an interview with Fox News before the election, Brazile denied leaking the questions to Clinton. But in a March 17, 2017, column for Time magazine, she finally admitted doing so, saying it was a  mistake I will forever regret. According to WND, their Twitter account was suspended because of this Seth Rich investigation bombshell. And now, Big League Politics is reporting associations the DC police chief who resigned only a month after Seth Rich was murdered ran in the same circles as many close to Hillary and top DNC officials. The police chief who oversaw Seth Rich s unsolved murder case has socialized and been honored alongside key Hillary Clinton advisers and even Rich s own boss at the Democratic National Committee. Rich is widely reported to be the source of Wikileaks  damning 2016 email release that showed the DNC colluding to hand the nomination to Clinton at the expense of Bernie Sanders. He was gunned down in D.C. 12 days before Wikileaks  release.On Sunday, July 10, 2016, at approximately 4:19 am, members of the Fifth District DC MPD were patrolling the area when they heard gunshots.  Upon arrival on the scene, members located an adult male victim conscious and breathing, and suffering from gunshot wounds.  The victim was transported to an area hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead.The decedent was identified as 27-year-old Seth Conrad Rich, of Northwest, DC.Controversy continues to swirl around the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich, that detectives working for the MPD under Chief Lanier called a  botched robbery  (even though nothing of any value appeared to have been stolen from Rich s body) after he was shot several times only blocks from his home.Former Metropolitan Police Department chief Cathy Lanier resigned from her post the month after Rich s murder to accept a position running security for the National Football League. She sits on the Washington Police Foundation board alongside Heather Podesta, the D.C. power broker who was married to Clinton campaign chief John Podesta s lobbyist brother Tony.In 2014, Lanier was honored on ELLE magazine s list of the ten most powerful women in Washington alongside top Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills and longtime Clinton friend and informal adviser Neera Tanden. Other honorees included NARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue and Obama Cabinet official Penny Pritzker.Lanier did attend ELLE and Hugo Boss  2015 Women in Washington Power List dinner at the German ambassador s house. Here she is chatting with Clinton crony and Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe.Who else was at the dinner? None other than Amy Dacey, the CEO of the Democratic National Committee at the time of Seth Rich s murder, who resigned one month after the killing as the DNC was rocked with scandal.Who else was at the dinner? None other than then-DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.",politics,"May 28, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
DONALD RUMSELD HUMILIATES “The View” Dingbat Joy Behar…Calls Her Out For Not Understanding How Presidents Are Elected [VIDEO],"There is no question that Whoopi Goldberg is a talented actress and has the ability to make people laugh, but the gift of comedy that Whoopi used to make herself so popular with her fans has mostly disappeared, and has been replaced with a hostility that is anything but funny.

Behar has made some embarrassing attempts lately to bond with guests from former members of George W. Bush s cabinet who ve appeared as guests on  The View . Bear is so completely enveloped with hate for President Trump, that she s actually convinced herself that the whole world hates Trump as much as she does. She s gone so far off the deep end, that she truly believes she can convince conservatives like Bush s former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, who appeared on  The View  last month [Watch HERE] to join her in her never-ending obsession to bash and discredit President Trump. Things didn t work out how Behar planned however, when Condoleezza Rice who gave Behar and her co-hosts an education on how things actually work in government and not how they wished they worked.This time around, it was George. W. Bush s former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld who appeared on  The View  and gave dingbat Joy Behar an education on how presidents are elected in the United States.WatchWhoopi Goldberg asked Rumsfeld if Trump s presidency was  unique  to which he replied that,  It s different.  Rumsfeld went on to explain how President Trump won in the primaries against some very qualified candidates, and went on to win against a  seasoned, well-known Democrat  Hillary Clinton. Behar pressed on, suggesting that Trump really is not a legitimate president because  he lost by 3 million votes.  Rumsfeld then proceeded to educate the loudmouth, emotional Joy Behar about how presidents are elected. Rumsfeld continued to educate the rest of the dingbats on  The View  who insisted on  engaging in hypotheticals  when it comes to the leftist tin-foil hat theory, that Trump worked with the Russians to affect the outcome of our elections.",politics,"May 28, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

He told the group to breed with Europeans. Yes, the plan is to breed with Europeans until all of Europe is Muslim. THE VIDEO IS BELOW:So now we have a second video from Denmark where an Imam is telling how Muslims are conquering Europe and that Muslims won t integrate into European society. We ve translated the video in the text below.These two videos follow with what we know. The invasion of Europe has a purpose and it s a very dark purpose. Conquering Europe is the end game Is America next?On hidden camera an imam explains how Muslims are  conquering  Europe and that Muslims should not integrate into society.Danish TV2 right now has a program called  Mosques behind the veil  which is focusing on whether a number of mosques discourage or contribute to integration.  Right now we are in a time when we are opening these countries, says Mohammad Fouad al-Barazi, the head imam of the mosque of the Islamic Union in Denmark, in secret recordings from the third episode of  Mosques behind the veil .The Imam speaks to TV2 s mole  Fatima , who is seeking guidance about how she as a newly immigrated Muslim should act in Denmark, and Mohammad Fouad al-Barazi explains that Muslims are now consuming Denmark and Europe.The link to the video is here but it is not translated: NYHEDER VIDEOAccording to experts TV2 has spoken with, the word open in an Islamist meaning is understood as  conquering .  Actually, opening sounds  beautiful , but this is the classic term for conquering a country, explains Professor Tina Magaard, who has studied the Quran and made fieldwork in Muslim communities in Denmark.According to Tina Magaard, some Islamic movements have the will to conquer Europe and the belief that one can.It is backed by a professor at the University of Copenhagen, Thomas Hoffmann, who has studied Islam and Islamic movements.  What al-Barazi says here, means conquest, but need not necessarily be understood as war-like conquest, he said.On hidden camera, Mohammad Fouad al-Barazi, elaborates what he thinks about Muslims  entry into Denmark and Europe.  Now there are Muslim communities throughout Europe. This means that there are a large number of Muslims. A really large number.The Imam tells  Fatma  that since he came to Denmark, many more Muslims have come to Denmark, and it is important that Muslims are not  merged  with the rest of society.  When I came to this country 23 years ago, we were only 55,000 Muslims. Now we are 300,000. The number of Muslims is 300,000 now. Hence the conclusion of this talk is that it is possible to live in this country without melting in. You must understand the conditions, without melting into society, says Mohammad Fouad Al-Barazi in the recordings.Via: nyheder",politics,"May 28, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

MEDIA BUSTED ON LATEST Lie About Trump…Here’s Why It’s So Important [Video],"The press has been lying about President Trump since day one but it s never been more evident than during the 9-day trip the POTUS and FLOTUS just finished.The press claimed that Melania Trump swatted the president s hand away during a walk. Not true!The press decided that the president manhandled a guest at the G7 when he moved forward to take his assigned spot. Not true!The latest lie is that President Trump chose not to listen and not wear headphones during a speech. Not true!The big problem with all of this is that the video of Trump watching the speech went viral and the tweet making the false claim was retweeted thousands of times. The retraction was retweeted about 42 times. Fake news and false allegations against our president end up becoming truth to those who read the fake news put out by the main stream media.

The Paris deal isn t just any other deal. It is a key agreement that shapes today s globalization,  Merkel said, describing discussions with Trump about climate change  very unsatisfying. Merkel doesn t understand that globalization is exactly why we don t like this boondoggle!For opponents of the agreement, the decision is a welcome development after the president s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, told reporters that Trump was  evolving  on the issue.

PRACTICING CATHOLIC Melania Trump Prays Over Sick Little Boy…Hours Later A Miracle Happens [VIDEO],"America is falling in love with Melania Trump. You can t help but notice how Melania lights up every time she is around children. Her trip to a local hospital in Rome was no exception. Melania used her special gift of speaking fluently in 5 languages to speak in Italian to the young patients. Melania shined around the sick children and they responded with smiles. Melania s visit with sick children at the hospital in Rome was captured in this AP video:While the media was busy obsessing over her veil and celebrities ignorantly mocked her modest clothing choice during a trip to the Vatican, the First Lady was busy praying over sick children   and it seems at least one of her prayers may have been answered.In fact, mere hours after Mrs. Trump prayed over a little boy whose heart was failing, doctors told her they had found a donated heart that could end up saving his life.

DEADBEATS BEWARE: Trump’s Food Stamp Reform Is Your Worst Nightmare,"All we re hearing from the left is fear mongering about President Trump s budget. We love what welfare to work is coming back after Obama stripped it out of requirements to receive benefits. Food stamp enrollment exploded during Obama s 8 years in office to be 44 million recipients.The American taxpayers are footing the bill for those who take advantage of the system. Here s the TRUTH about what the Trump administration has proposed for food stamps:WORK REQUIREMENTS: In reality, the president s proposed policy is based on two principles: requiring able-bodied adult recipients to work or prepare for work in exchange for benefits, and restoring minimal fiscal responsibility to state governments for the welfare programs they operate.The president s budget reasserts the basic concept that welfare should not be a one-way handout. Welfare should, instead, be based on reciprocal obligations between recipients and taxpayers.SHIFTING MORE RESPONSIBILITY ON STATES:Why should the federal government pay for almost all of the freebies? Shifting the responsibility to the states will help with accountability. Perhaps some of the states will make a better effort to clean up the fraud that s so rampant in the system.Read more: Daily Signal",politics,"May 26, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

"CNN HOSTS PANIC When Congressman, Lawyer Says Feds Need To Investigate Seth Rich Murder During Russia-Trump Collusion Discussion [VIDEO]","Caller-Times: Speaking on CNN Wednesday, the fourth-term congressman refuted a widely believed conclusion that the Russian government interfered with the U.S. presidential election to aid President Donald Trump s campaign and instead indicated a conspiracy theory about a slain Democratic National Committee staffer could be true. My fear is our constant focusing on the Russians is deflecting away for some other things that we need to be investigating,  Farenthold said on the network.  There s still some question as to whether the intrusion of the DNC server was an insider job or whether or not it was the Russians. Later Wednesday, Farenthold elaborated on his opinion of how the investigation should be handled in a phone interview with the Caller-Times. The death should be investigated in the same manner Russian interference has been reviewed, he said. That should be a part of the ongoing investigation into alleged Russian interference in the election, because that s an alternative theory that deserves being looked at,  Farenthold said.Watch how quickly CNN hosts John Berman and Poppy Harlow attack Congressman Farenthold when he even suggests there s something suspicious about the supposed  robbery gone bad  (where no valuables were stolen) that lead to the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich. JUST NOW @farenthold on @CNN suggests the DNC hack was an  insider job,"" sources  stuff circulating on the internet  https://t.co/97zytNWHVR  Haley Draznin (@haleydraz) May 24, 2017While he has not formed an opinion on the nature of Rich s death, Farenthold said the theory that it was a retaliatory killing for leaking committee information is  as credible as the anonymous sources being cited in the (Former-FBI Director James) Comey and Russian stories against President Trump. Farenthold said the Russian conclusion is premature until there s a review of Democratic committee s computer system by an independent investigator. We re relying only on the report of somebody that the DNC contracted to examine their computer rather than having federal officials,  Farenthold said. To me, we need to let the feds look at it.

LISTEN TO THEM LAUGH! Undercover VIDEO Captures Diabolical Remarks At National ABORTION Federation Conference…”An Eyeball Just Fell Into My Lap..And That’s Gross”,"A shocking new video has just been released by the Center for Medical Progress, the undercover investigative group that in 2015 released videos showing that Planned Parenthood affiliates have profited from selling the body parts of aborted babies.This latest video is a preview of footage that CMP investigators gathered at the 2014 and 2015 National Abortion Federation conventions, attended by hundreds of members of the abortion industry each year. (The NAF is a major trade group of North American abortion providers, and Planned Parenthood makes up about 50 percent of its members and leadership.)Notice the audience laughing at some of the most vile comments you have ever heard about the killing and dismembering of babies in the womb:https://youtu.be/Sq1ycCmX3uUHere are some of the most horrifying remarks from the brand-new undercover footage. Attendees made some of these comments during official presentations, and others directly to undercover CMP investigators.Dr. Lisa Harris, the medical director of Planned Parenthood of Michigan: Given that we actually see the fetus the same way, and given that we might actually both agree that there s violence in here. . . . Let s just give them all the violence, it s a person, it s killing, let s just give them all that.Dr. Ann Schutt-Aine, the director of abortion services for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast (which has been referred to local law-enforcement for criminal charges related to fetal-tissue trafficking): If I m doing a procedure, and I m seeing that I m in fear that it s about to come to the umbilicus [navel], I might ask for a second set of forceps to hold the body at the cervix and pull off a leg or two, so it s not PBA [partial-birth abortion].Dr. Stacy De-Lin, the director of abortion services for Planned Parenthood of New York City: But we certainly do intact D&Es [dilation and extraction, otherwise known as partial-birth abortion, a method that is illegal under federal law].Dr. Uta Landy, the founder of the Consortium of Abortion Providers (CAPS), Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA): An eyeball just fell down into my lap, and that is gross! [laughter from the crowd]Talcott Camp, the deputy director of the ACLU s Reproductive Health Freedom Project: I m like   Oh my God! I get it! When the skull is broken, that s really sharp! I get it! I understand why people are talking about getting that skull out, that calvarium. Dr. Susan Robinson, an abortion provider at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte: The fetus is a tough little object, and taking it apart, I mean, taking it apart on Day One is very difficult. . . . You go in there, and you go,  Am I getting the uterus or the fetus? Oh, good, fetus. [Robinson makes a stabbing sound effect] What have I got? Nothing. Let s try again. Below are some comments from the footage that provide further evidence of Planned Parenthood s involvement in illegally profiting from fetal-tissue trafficking.Dr. Leslie Drummond, an abortion provider at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte (a PPFA affiliate that contracted with a biotech firm to be paid per fetal organ provided): I get a lot of oohs and ahhs from StemExpress [biotech firm]. You know, they re wanting livers. . . . Last week I was in Sacramento, and she said,  I need four intact limbs.  And I said, you want what?This part of the video should dispel any doubt Americans had about Planned Parenthood selling baby parts for profit:Dr. Stacy De-Lin, the director of abortion services for Planned Parenthood of NYC: But I think a financial incentive from you guys [CMP investigators posing as tissue buyers] is going to be like . . .  the people who we have to get this approved from will be very happy about it. Dr. Paul Blumenthal, the former medical director for PP of Maryland: I know Planned Parenthood sells a lot of stuff [fetal organs] to people. Both the NAF and Planned Parenthood sought and obtained a preliminary injunction against the Center for Medical Progress to prevent the release of these undercover videos. That civil suit is currently on appeal. But California s attorney general took matters into his own hands in late March, charging CMP investigators David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt with 14 felony counts of illegally recording  confidential communications.  The state refuses to name the 14 accusers in the criminal case, even though Daleiden and Merritt have themselves been charged publicly.Read more at: National Review",politics,"May 25, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
IT BEGINS: NEW YORK SCHOOL Scheduled To Set Aside Special Classrooms For Muslim Prayer,"Clifton Park, New York is the latest school to succumb to Muslim prayer rooms. We ve documented this trend across America of Islam creeping into the schools. The latest case in San Diego of Sharia Law being taught in the classrooms has ended up in court:FEDERAL LAWSUIT Filed Against San Diego School District s Pro-Islam, Pro-Sharia Law PolicyOne question should be asked with this infiltration of Muslim prayer in our schools: WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THE OTHER RELIGIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM DOING ANYTHING CLOSE TO PRAYING IN SCHOOL?  The largest school district in Saratoga County says it will allow Muslim students to pray in rooms in at its  high school.The Shenendehowa High School Principal says classrooms are being set aside so Muslim students can pray during Ramadan. Since then, we ve heard from parents who are against the move.One parent sent us a letter explaining her concerns saying:  Since prayer for other religions was removed from school years ago, I feel as Shen has crossed the line on allowing this on campus.  Some folks we talked to in Clifton Park agreed, like David Chapleau.  You just can t bring religion into a public institution where were really trying to teach kids to the idea of opening their critical faculties,  Chapleau said. The woman s outcry is in response to an email from the Shenendehowa High School Principal to students and parents. It addresses the month of Ramadan, a time of fasting and prayer for Muslims. It says, in part: Prayer occurs on a daily basis for practicing Muslims. This can be challenging in today s modern public high school. In an attempt to make reasonable accommodations for students and employees to meet their personal religious obligations, room 65 in High School West and room 109 in High School East have been set aside so students can incorporate this important aspect of their religion into their daily activities while at school.  The letter explains two classrooms will be set aside for students to meet their religious obligations during school hours. A school spokesperson says the decision was made after the high school principal met with the leader of a local mosque in an attempt to improve the school s cultural proficiency. She says the school can t refuse a student s request to leave class for required prayer, and says the space allows Muslim students to return to class quickly after praying.READ MORE: CBS6LOCAL",politics,"May 25, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
EX-CIA DIRECTOR Reveals What Triggered Obama to Spy on Trump…You Won’t Believe What it is!," The former CIA Director told a House committee that Obama started to spy on Trump after he cracked a joke about Russia releasing Hillary Clinton s lost emails:Russia, if you re listening Rush Limbaugh reported:The Obama administration had ZERO EVIDENCE that the Russians were tampering with the US election but started listening in on Donald Trump and his top advisers  phone calls after Candidate Trump cracked a joke at a campaign press conference!Director of Central Intelligence Agency John Brennan takes questions from reporters during a press conference art CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, December 11, 2014. The head of the Central Intelligence Agency acknowledged Thursday some agency interrogators used  abhorrent  unauthorized techniques in questioning terrorism suspects after the 9/11 attacks. CIA director John Brennan said there was no way to determine whether the methods used produced useful intelligence, but he strongly denied the CIA misled the public.Rush Limbaugh reported:RUSH LIMBAUGH: Did you hear yesterday in all the double-talk that Brennan was using, he said that there was no evidence of any collusion, but there was a basis to start a CIA-FBI investigation. Now, what would the basis be if there s no evidence? There s no evidence, but there was a basis. No evidence! He s just the latest in a long line of officials in the intelligence community, in Congress, and the Obama administration who say there s no evidence of collusion.Trump-Russians? No evidence the Russians tampered with votes. But there was a basis to start an investigation. Do you know what it was? Do you know what it was? Trump s joke! When Trump said/put out a call,  Hey, Russia, maybe you can find 30,000 emails by Hillary Clinton that nobody can t find  That joke. I kid you not! That joke and the dossier that was totally made up, like Trump hire prostitutes to urinate on the bed that Obama slept it in Moscow. Those two things are the bases to start all of this. Trump telling a joke.I ve told you the left has no sense of humor, and they don t. And I ve seen it a thousand times! People on the left really believe that Trump was sending a message to the Russians to hack Hillary s server. We were way past that when this happened. Hillary had already done something with 60,000 of her emails. Thirty thousand she turned over to the State Department; 30,000 she deleted. She said they were irrelevant, but they were somewhere.Kim Dotcom was saying he had  em or could get  em. Everybody was wondering where they were. Trump, at a press conference, made a joke, a typical Trump joke,  Hey, Russia!  It s the kind of thing I would do, and I laughed myself silly. That is one of the bases for starting this whole cockamamie thing. By the way, in all these leaks of Trump phone calls, why aren t there any leaks of Trump phone calls and collusion with Russia?",politics,"May 25, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

WOW! IS SEAN HANNITY’S Job With FOX News In Jeopardy Over Seth Rich Investigation?,"What the heck is going on over at FOX News, the cable news network that used to be the only place on TV that Americans could go to for truth?Sean Hannity is one of the few conservative voices with a massive audience who is willing to stick his neck out and risk his career to get the truth out behind the murder of 27-year old DNC staffer Seth Rich.After the notorious hacker Kim Dot.com tweeted about his claim to have evidence that Seth Rich was the person who sent the DNC emails to Wikileaks, Sean Hannity responded to him. Hannity even asked Dotcom to appear on his show, hoping that he would reveal evidence that Seth Rich was the person who sent the DNC emails to Wikileaks, and NOT the Russians.Here was the first email from Kim Dotcom where he claims to have known Seth Rich and that Rich was the Wikileaks source.  Dotcom also claims he was involved in the email exchange.I knew Seth Rich. I know he was the @Wikileaks source. I was involved. https://t.co/MbGQteHhZM  Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) May 20, 2017Sean Hannity responded to Kim Dotcom s tweet:You are the evidence?

If Seth was wiki source, no Trump/Russia collusion https://t.co/QPHZwypU34  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 22, 2017The flailing cable network station FOX News, that just fell into 3rd place in the ratings after firing their top host Bill O Reilly, made a public statement today about Sean Hannity s investigation into the murder of Seth Rich and the possibility that he was the DNC leaker.From FOX News:On May 16, a story was posted on the Fox News website on the investigation into the 2016 murder of DNC Staffer Seth Rich. The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.We will continue to investigate this story and will provide updates as warranted.After FOX News disavowed the Seth Rich story, liberal rag  The Daily Beast  published a story with unnamed sources at FOX News who were  embarrassed  by Sean Hannity pursuing this story, claiming he had  no evidence .Sean Hannity re-tweeted their baseless, nameless story here:Very interesting.

I m trying to find the truth as the Mom Dad bro asked https://t.co/op11hVRlWW  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 23, 2017The more attention the Seth Rich case gets, the more the left is freaking out. Watch sanctimonious and as far as we know, the jobless Keith Olbermann (he lists his job as a  GQ correspondent  in his Twitter profile) tell his massive audience on Twitter (only 169 people  liked  his video) that Seth Rich was murdered in a  botched robbery .  Sorry Keith Bozo, but when nothing of value is stolen from the body of the person you were  robbing  it s not really considered a  robbery.

Tonight could be a make it or break it night for Sean Hannity and his career with FOX News. No matter what happens on Hannity s show tonight, he s a hero in our eyes for at least pursuing the possibility that something other than the contrived Trump-Russia narrative put forth by the Democrats and their allies in the media could actually be the truth Here s to Hannity making conservatives proud again!

O’REILLY BLASTS FOX NEWS’ Liberal Murdoch Brothers After Disastrous Viewer Ratings Are Revealed,"It looks like Bill O Reilly is getting the last laugh When the Fox News Channel fired cable news giant Bill O Reilly in April, reports surfaced revealing Fox News  owner, the Murdoch family, wanting to move the network in a different direction.

More hosts similar to Megyn Kelly, who is now at NBC News, fewer like the ones who built the network from the ground up, including O Reilly.About one month later, Fox News has a completely different news lineup, and the results thus far have been nothing short of disastrous.On Thursday, TV Newser reported Fox News, which once dominated its competitors in virtually every timeslot, is now losing across the board in the key 25-54 demographic.The results are most notable in primetime, which used to carry Fox News  most reliable audience. Now, Fox News is running a distant third to hosts who previously drew audiences half the size of O Reilly s.On Thursday, at the 7 p.m. hour, Fox News   The Story,  hosted by Martha MacCallum, lost by more than 100,000 viewers in the 25-54 demographic to CNN s  OutFront  with Erin Burnett.

D.C. BAR OWNER Where Seth Rich Was Last Seen Drops Bombshell: NO EMPLOYEES Of Bar Questioned By DC Police…Never Asked For Surveillance Tapes [VIDEO],"Last week, Private Investigator Rod Wheeler appeared on Fox5 news in DC with an update in the unsolved murder of DNC IT expert Seth Rich, claiming proof exists on Rich s laptop proving he was Julian Assange s source for leaked DNC emails during the 2016 election   an account in direct conflict to the Russian hacking narrative based on a discredited IT firm s report.Wheeler walked back his statements the next day, however the fuse was already lit  Weaponized autists on Reddit and 4chan began furiously digging back into the Seth Rich case for clues in the still unsolved murder   and they went deep.Among the findings were Seth Rich s Reddit account, email addresses, and Twitter accounts   one of which was in support of candidate Bernie Sanders. As an aside  before joining the DNC, Rich moved to Washington DC to take a job with polling and research firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner  whose founder Stanley Greenberg was a senior advisor to President Bill Clinton.Reddit s the_donald goes darkAs Seth Rich posts reached a crescendo Friday night  dominating the front page of /r/The_Donald, the Conde Nast-linked website shut the  subreddit  down for around 12 hours following a moderator s unrelated declaration of war on the rest of Reddit over censorship  completely killing the Seth Rich momentum. When The_Donald was reopened, officially  to aid the Seth Rich effort   the offending moderator had been banned and two other mods were removed from their positions. Seth Rich posts, however, are notably sparse. Oh, and Reddit edited Seth Rich s account during the lockout.Meanwhile in New ZealandKim Dotcom is pissed   and has been plotting revenge against Hillary Clinton, Obama, and Hollywood after being targeted in the biggest copyright infringement case in history  which included a massive illegal (and then legal) raid on his New Zealand mansion by 76 armed officers and two helicopters.Dotcom tweets that Democrats attacked his family and stole his assets in a copyright infringement case and appears to be suggesting that he was paying them back by sending Rich s DNC emails to Wikileaks:Democrats destroyed my business, attacked my family, stole my assets in a pay4play strike for the @MPAACounterstrike:Trump Presidency   Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) May 19, 2017Sean Hannity has offered Dotcom a national platform (which Kim retweeted)I knew Seth Rich.

Sources sometimes talk to other parties but identities never emerge from WikiLeaks. #SethRich  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) May 22, 2017Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich all discussed the mysterious murder of DNC staffer last week, who, according to Rich s parents was getting ready to work for Hillary s campaign when he was murdered on his way home from a local bar late at night. Here is a compilation of Hannity and Limbaugh s remarks on the Rich case:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXn6FzWBS4oWhy were no employees of Joe s City Bar where Rich was last seen questioned about his final hours leading up to his murder? Why was the surveillance tape in the bar not seen by investigators? WND A manager of the Washington, D.C., bar where Democratic National Committee worker Seth Rich was last spotted hours before he was shot and killed last summer told WND that D.C. police officers never interviewed the bar s staff or requested any evidence from the bar, including the bar s surveillance video from that night, as part of an investigation into Rich s murder.The revelation backs up a claim made by a private investigator who worked on the case who said D.C. police were told to  stand down  on the investigation.WND also can report that the investigator recently was ordered to  cease and desist  his work on the murder case. The police never asked for the surveillance video from that night,  a manager of Lou s City Bar told WND.His name is being withheld for this story.He said the bar s surveillance video runs in a cycle of 30 days and that, by now, any footage that may have existed of Rich the last night he was seen alive has been taped over.Furthermore, the manager said police never asked for any other kind of evidence from the bar such as Rich s bar receipt from that night. The manager did note he wasn t sure if Rich paid using a credit card or cash. Seth Rich s girlfriend, best friend and parents all speak out about the brutal murder that DC detectives are calling a  botched robbery  that left Rich dead while leaving all of his valuables, including his wallet on his person. Seth Rich s parents admitted that after Seth was shot, police reported that he was  quite talkative . If Seth was  quite talkative,  then why aren t there any leads on his killers? Seth s parents appear to be Hillary sycophants. They appear to be very proud of their son as they tell Crime Watch Daily that he was just getting ready to go to work for Hillary s campaign. They also adamantly stand behind the Democrat Party and claim they are angered by any claim that a hit was ordered on Rich by online citizen journalists.As more and more evidence is being revealed about Rich s possible role as the leaker of the DNC emails to Wikileaks, the attitude of Seth s parents towards citizen journalists has taken a surprising turn. In this video that was just released, Rich s parents appear to be praising the work of citizen journalists that are forcing the investigation into Seth Rich s death via social media.https://twitter.com/RedPillDropper/status/866071104112209921According to research conducted by a 4Chan citizen journalists, Joseph Capone, the owner of Lou s City Bar where Rich was last seen alive, visited the East Wing of the White House 4 days before the murder of Seth Rich.A visit by a Joseph P. Capone to the East Wing of the White House on July is verified on the government White House visitor log website. We cannot verify that this is the same Joe Capone who owns Lou s City bar where Seth was last seen. According the White House Museum website, the East Wing is reserved for  the first lady and her staff, including the White House social secretary and correspondence staff.:Crime Watch Daily investigated the murder of Seth Rich and compiled an interesting video that includes interviews with Seth s girlfriend, best friend and parents.Although there are pockets of darkness, for the most part this neighborhood is pretty well-lit. Investigators tell Crime Watch Daily in the early morning hours of July 10, Seth was walking home. He was only about a block and a half away from home when he was gunned down, shot in the back. The officers who were there and they said  Yeah, he was quite talkative, he did not realize he had been shot,'  said Joel Rich, Seth s father.But an hour and a half later at a nearby hospital, Seth was pronounced dead.Heartbreaking news to Kelsey Mulka. She was just on the phone with him, and in a split-second he was gone. Now Mulka is breaking news in our exclusive interview, revealing details, telling Crime Watch Daily there was no sign of trouble in his voice that terrible morning.

THE PROBLEM WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION…Explained As If You Were 5-Years-Old," Among the findings:A Complex Fiscal Picture Welfare use. Our findings show that many of the preconceived notions about the fiscal impact of illegal households turn out to be inaccurate. In terms of welfare use, receipt of cash assistance programs tends to be very low, while Medicaid use, though significant, is still less than for other households. Only use of food assistance programs is significantly higher than that of the rest of the population. Also, contrary to the perceptions that illegal aliens don t pay payroll taxes, we estimate that more than half of illegals work  on the books.  On average, illegal households pay more than $4,200 a year in all forms of federal taxes. Unfortunately, they impose costs of $6,950 per household.The Impact of Amnesty. Finally, our estimates show that amnesty would significantly increase tax revenue. Because both their income and tax compliance would rise, we estimate that under the most likely scenario the average illegal alien household would pay 77 percent ($3,200) more a year in federal taxes once legalized. While not enough to offset the 118 percent ($8,200) per household increase in costs that would come with legalization, amnesty would significantly increase both the average income and tax payments of illegal aliens.What s Different About Today s Immigration. Many native-born Americans observe that their ancestors came to America and did not place great demands on government services. Perhaps this is true, but the size and scope of government were dramatically smaller during the last great wave of immigration. Not just means-tested programs, but expenditures on everything from public schools to roads were only a fraction of what they are today. Thus, the arrival of unskilled immigrants in the past did not have the negative fiscal implications that it does today. Moreover, the American economy has changed profoundly since the last great wave of immigration, with education now the key determinant of economic success. The costs that unskilled immigrants impose simply reflect the nature of the modern American economy and welfare state. It is doubtful that the fiscal costs can be avoided if our immigration policies remain unchanged.

BREAKING NEWS: Reince Priebus Makes Early Return Home From Trump’s First Foreign Trip,"The White House confirmed to FOX Business that Priebus would be heading back to Washington D.C. after the stop in Saudi Arabia, part of the president s visit to the Middle East, and insisted this was always part of the administration s plan.Natalie Strom, assistant press secretary at the White House, told FOX Business,  It has always been planned for Reince to return to Washington following the Saudi Arabia portion of the trip. It s a big week in D.C. for the president s agenda with our budget release coming soon and discussions continuing on tax reform, so he s needed back at home for that. When asked which other officials would be coming home, Strom said,  Only a few senior administration officials are staying on for the whole trip, which is typical for these kinds of trips. They re attending the stops that most pertain to their responsibilities. Off the top of my head I know that Secretary [of State] Tillerson and General McMaster won t be on for the entirety. As FOX Business reported Friday, Priebus s position in the White House is once again in jeopardy as National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney are a few of the candidates under consideration to replace him if the president decides to go that route, according to sources close to the situation.On Friday, the White House did not deny the possibility that Priebus could be replaced.While the administration may believe it s typical for some officials to stay and others to head home, according to experts outside the White House, it s unusual for a chief of staff to head home early on such an important trip.

DEMOCRAT CHAIRMAN YELLS “All Together Now…F*ck Donald Trump!”…Crowd Shoots Middle Finger At Stage [VIDEO],"AP reported:California s elected Democrats had tough words for President Donald Trump and the GOP Congress on Saturday, urging their party s fired-up activists to work against the 14 Republicans in the state s congressional delegation.The party s leaders blasted Trump s alleged ties to Russia and presented California as the epicenter of liberal resistance to the president. The world, literally the world, is counting on all of you, counting on California to reject Trump s deception and destructiveness,  said Lt. Gov.

"BRAVO! PRESIDENT TRUMP Renews America’s Standing As World Leader With Historical, No Apologies Speech To Arab Nations [VIDEO]"," Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely  invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith. Terrorists do not worship God. They worship death.    President Donald J. TrumpDonald Trump insisted in a speech addressing global  Islamic extremism  that Muslim leaders must scare would-be terrorists into submission, warning them about the impact suicide bombings will have on their immortal souls. Religious leaders must make this absolutely clear: Barbarism will deliver you no glory   piety to evil will bring you no dignity,  Trump said in a sumptuous Saudi ballroom that put Mar-a-Lago to shame. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be fully condemned,  he said. Heroes don t kill innocents,  a confident Trump declared at the King Abdulaziz Conference Center in Riyadh.  They save them. The president urged 55 world leaders from Arab and other Muslim nations to  drive out  terrorists from every corner of their lives   including mosques   in a zero-tolerance approach that lines up with his 2016 campaign rhetoric. Drive them out!  he said.  Drive them out of your places of worship, Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy lands, and drive them out of this earth,  he trumpeted.Trump s performance was forceful at times but largely a cautious, measured and presidential-sounding effort, raising his voice only once. With God s help this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed,  the president said.Trump insisted that fighting terrorism is  a battle between good and evil,  not between  different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations. Terrorists do not worship God. They worship death,  Trump declared.  If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen and what will be the end result. He predicted that in the absence of multi-nation commitments to action,  peaceful societies will be engulfed by violence, and the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. And if the world doesn t unite to fight ISIS, al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas and other groups, he said,  not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, we will be judged by God. Trump said Middle Eastern nations  can t wait  for the U.S. to solve the terror problem for them. Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combating radicalization,  he said.Trump took pains to isolate Iran in his speech, saying the Islamic republican is spreading  destruction and chaos  throughout the Middle East and gives terrorists  safe harbor, financial backing and the social standing needed for recruitment. Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, too, declared on Sunday that  the Iranian regime has been the spearhead of global terrorism. Trump called defeating global terrorism  history s great test,  as he urged summit attendees to  vanquish the forces that terrorism brings with it every single time. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence and innocent from hatred,  Trump said. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it,  Trump said, reading from teleprompters.Watch video here:King Salman seemed to agree with Trump s most aggressive and foreboding statement   that jihadi terrorists place their souls at risk. Our way to achieve the goals of our religion and win everlasting life in heaven is to promote the tolerant values of Islam, which are based in peace and moderation,  he said in introducing Trump from behind a desk onstage.

Salman called on Gulf Cooperation Council leaders to  reject extremism, work on fighting all forms of terrorism, stop its financing and its propagation, dry up its sources, and stand firm in confronting this scourge that poses a danger to all of humanity.

The over-the-top potty talk by the Chairman Tom Perez was bad enough but now the California Dem Chairman has raised the bar on nastiness. He prompts the crowd to yell out  F@ck Donald Trump!  The kicker is that Nancy Pelosi was caught laughing with the crowd. How unbelievably childish are these people?AP reported:California s elected Democrats had tough words for President Donald Trump and the GOP Congress on Saturday, urging their party s fired-up activists to work against the 14 Republicans in the state s congressional delegation.The party s leaders blasted Trump s alleged ties to Russia and presented California as the epicenter of liberal resistance to the president. The world, literally the world, is counting on all of you, counting on California to reject Trump s deception and destructiveness,  said Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is among a crowded field of Democrats running for governor next year.U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, often mentioned as a potential candidate for president in 2020, accused Trump of putting  Russia first, America second. In a sign of the vigor of the party s distaste for the president, outgoing party Chair John Burton, a longtime Democratic lawmaker and powerbroker known for his blunt and profane manner, extended two middle fingers in the air as the crowd cheered and joined him.

HILARIOUS! FOX News’ Greg Gutfeld Introduces New Sponsor Of His Show…”Victima” [VIDEO],"At the start of the Fox News Greg Gutfeld Show, Gutfeld showed a hilarious clip mocking the hysteria of the Democrat Party. Gutfeld began his show by telling his viewers,  I m really excited to introduce a new sponsor to our show. It s a new drug. It s called  Victima'  Gutfeld went on to explain that the drug was created to help Democrats who are feeling defeated after the brutal election of Donald Trump cope:  When identity politics no longer work, try  Victima .America s been witnessing the embarrassing meltdown of liberals ever since President Trump shocked the world with his stinging defeat of Crooked Hillary, so Gutfeld decided to have a little fun by mocking the embarrassing behavior of the left.The voice in the commercial mimics the typical TV drug commercials with sappy music playing in the background:  It s not what it used to be. It used to be fine.The Democratic Party it s not performong.It s slow, sluggish, confused, prone to fits of despair. It may be time for  Victima . Victims, when your old identity politics no longer work, Victima gives you that added boost to get you to where you want to be. When I take Victima, I see everyone as a  racist . It really works. Watch:Ironically, FOX News fired Bob Beckel, the only liberal on the Gutfeld Show the day after this show aired, after he allegedly made a  racist  remark that offended a black employee working at FOX.

IS TIM ALLEN’S “Last Man Standing” About To Be Revived After “Passionate” Conservatives Express Outrage Over ABC’s Decision To Cancel Show?,"Tim Allen took to Twitter to express his disappointment after discovering that the second highest rated comedy TV series on ABC,  Last Man Standing  was going to be cancelled:Stunned and blindsided by the network I called home for the last six years. #lastmanstanding  Tim Allen (@ofctimallen) May 16, 2017Many of his fans commented in support of his courage to stand up for his conservative views:Thanks for standing up and speaking out against the PC police for as long as you could, Tim.  Mark Dice (@MarkDice) May 16, 2017Conservative comedian Mark Dice also reminded him that his comments on a recent Jimmy Kimmel show about how it was tough to be a conservative in Hollywood, was likely the final straw that caused ABC to cancel his show: You calling out the Liberals for their insanity on Jimmy Kimmel was the last straw for the Network, but someone had to do it. Thanks, Tim!  Mark Dice (@MarkDice) May 16, 2017A petition was started last week by  Last Man Standing  fans and now has over 371K signatures. The petition asks ABC to reconsider their decision to cancel the  Last Man Standing  and to renew the show. Here is the LINK to that petition:The petition to ABC reads:Despite consistently high rankings, especially considering the time slot in which it is aired, Tim Allen s show  Last Man Standing  has been cancelled by the network on which it is aired, ABC. Last Man Standing stands out in the sea of network television sitcoms.  It is a show that appeals to a broad swath of Americans who find very few shows that extol the virtues with which they can identify; namely conservative values. Last Man Standing was not just selling conservative ideals though, as some of the characters in the show are clearly of the liberal persuasion, yet the characters on the show all manage to get along and take care of one another, despite their politically opposed views.  The show is about more than politics though, it is about family.  In fact, politics is only a secondary part of the show, but one in which many Americans can readily identify. Last Man Standing is one of the only shows on broadcast television, and the only sitcom, that is not constantly shoving liberal ideals down the throats of the viewers.  And sadly, that is likely the real reason the show has been cancelled.The intent of this petition/boycott is to attempt to get ABC to renew the show.  With that in mind, I will no longer be watching any ABC shows.  I have cancelled the DVR settings for the other ABC shows that I regularly watch.  If you want to help try to save Last Man Standing, I encourage you to do the same.  Even if you are not willing to boycott the network, but still want to save the show, please sign this petition and share it.  If you do plan to boycott ABC, please say so when you sign.  Let them hear our voices.Now, Studio 20th Century Fox Television is looking for a new home for canceled Tim Allen comedy  Last Man Standing. Speaking to Variety Thursday, studio presidents Jonnie Davis and Howard Kurtzman said that they were surprised by ABC s decision to pull the plug on the show. That s the one that s really an open sore right now,  Davis said. Kurtzman added,  We really were expecting a pickup. The fact that we didn t get a pickup was a surprise and a disappointment. I think no one was more disappointed than Tim Allen, such a huge star with such a huge following. But the series, which was ABC s second most-watched comedy last season behind  Modern Family,  may not be dead. Asked whether  Last Man Standing  would be shopped to other networks, Kurtzman said,  We re starting to explore that. If it s not going to go forward at ABC, of course Jonnie and I are hopeful that we can find another home for it. Political and social conservatives have been vocal in their disappointment over the show s end. Allen, its star and executive producer, is conservative and a supporter of President Trump.Speaking to reporters Tuesday, ABC entertainment president Channing Dungey denied that  Last Man Standing  was canceled because of Allen s right-leaning politics, and said that it was, instead, a scheduling decision.  Once we made the decision not to continue with comedy on Friday, it was just kind of that s where we landed,  she said.  VarietyTime will tell if ABC s fan base is more important to them than their liberal views ",politics,"May 20, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

"RUSH LIMBAUGH, WIFE KATHRYN, SEAN HANNITY and Ethel Kennedy Attend Roger Ailes Funeral Under Heavy Security [VIDEO]","Radio host and frequent FOX News contributor Laura Ingraham and Fox News   The Five  host Kimberly Guilfoyle were seen leaving the funeral service for former FOX News chief Roger Ailes with Sean Hannity.  Kimberly Guilfoyle was one of the few women at FOX News who stood up for Roger Ailes when he was being accused of sexually harassment by former Fox and Friends host Gretchen Carlson. Guilfoyle tweeted a message of support for the Ailes family on Twitter following his death:RIP #RogerAiles sending my love and prayers to Beth & Zachary. Roger was a friend and a mentor to so many of us @FoxNews he will be missed  Kimberly Guilfoyle (@kimguilfoyle) May 18, 2017Guilfoyle also bravely eulogized Ailes on FOX News. It was her current bosses the Murdoch boys, who fired Roger Ailes, the man who put FOX News at the top of the ratings due to allegations of sexually harassment by Gretchen Carlson and later from former FOX host Megyn Kelly:Former Fox News boss Roger Ailes was eulogized in the town of Palm Beach at St. Edward Roman Catholic church Saturday morning in a service heavy with references to suffering. Beth (Ailes wife, Elizabeth) came to me Friday and asked that I officiate,  St. Edward Monsignor Thomas J. Klinzing told DailyMail.com.  She asked me to base some of my reading on the theme of suffering. I believe Roger suffered quite a bit with those accusations. Klingzing was referring to Ailes  firing from the network he founded last year after fired FNC anchorwoman Gretchen Carlson accused him of sexual harassment followed by other women coming forward with similar accusations.Ailes  coffin was carried out at 11am to the altar of the 90-year-old church, famously President John F. Kennedy s Winter White House church, as five members of the Palm Beach Police Department presented the colors.The ceremony was kept secret by Ailes family members and was attended by fewer than 100 family and friends, and took place with heavy security under the watch of three private security guards.The media guru and political strategist died on Thursday in Palm Beach, Florida aged 77.Rush Limbaugh and his wife Kathryn were in the front row. Douglas Kennedy, a nephew of JFK who works at Fox News, read from Letters of Paul to the Romans, a passage about how nothing can separate a believer from the love of God.Sean Hannity read a responsorial psalm. I wouldn t be what I am today without Roger,  Hannity told DailyMail.com exclusively after the funeral.  He took me as a local radio host in Atlanta and gave me the opportunity of a lifetime. He saw things in people that no one else would see. He is an American patriot of the highest level.

SOFT COUP ALERT: Shocking Percentage Of Negative Coverage On Trump Will Blow Your Mind!,"The Harvard study below will blow your mind! If you had any doubt Trump is being sabotaged by the main stream media and Washington old guards, look no further Coverage of President Trump is 93% negative! This is over the top! Our media and politicians are doing everything they can to destroy Trump How negative was press coverage of President Trump s first 100 days in office? Far more than that of Barack Obama, George W. Bush, or Bill Clinton, according to a new report from the Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.The Harvard scholars analyzed the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and the main newscasts (not talk shows) of CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC during Trump s initial time in office. They found, to no one s surprise, that Trump absolutely dominated news coverage in the first 100 days. And then they found that news coverage was solidly negative   80 percent negative among those outlets studied, versus 20 percent positive.The numbers for previous presidents: Barack Obama, 41 percent negative, 59 percent positive; George W. Bush, 57 percent negative, 43 percent positive; and Bill Clinton, 60 percent negative, 40 percent positive.Accusations of bias aside, it s simply a fact that a number of negative things happened in Trump s opening 100 days. The Russia investigation, for example, was a source of endless criticism from Democrats and other Trump opponents. The travel ban executive order led to intense argument and losses for the administration in the courts. The healthcare debacle created more negative coverage because it was a major screwup and a setback for both Trump and House Republicans.That said, the coverage of some news organizations was so negative, according to the Harvard study, that it seems hard to argue that the coverage was anywhere near a neutral presentation of facts. Assessing the tone of news coverage, the Harvard researchers found that CNN s Trump coverage was 93 percent negative, and seven percent positive. The researchers found the same numbers for NBC.Obama and Hillary s hero had this to say about taking down an enemy:Obama Campaign Manager and Senior Adviser had this to say about Trump last June: IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY BEAT TRUMP. HE MUST BE DESTROYED THOROUGHLY. HIS KIND MUST NOT RISE AGAIN.

LOL! DEMOCRATS’ “Poster Child For Stupidity” Can’t Tell MSNBC Host What Her Party Stands For Besides Hating Trump [VIDEO],"Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) struggled Friday on MSNBC to explain what the Democratic Party stands for besides opposing President Trump.Waters has been one of the most outspoken critics of Trump in Congress, repeatedly calling for his impeachment and insisting that if investigators  connect the dots,  then his campaign s alleged collusion with Russia will become apparent.Given Waters  public profile as a staunch Trump opponent, MSNBC host Katy Tur asked the lawmaker what Democrats actually stand for beyond opposing Trump s agenda. Congresswoman, what do the Democrats stand for other than being against Donald Trump?  Tur asked.  What do you stand for other than trying to get Donald Trump impeached? Everyone knows that I am the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee and that I have spent many, many hours and days implementing the Dodd-Frank reforms,  Waters responded.The California Democrat proceeded to frame her work on Dodd-Frank in the context of opposing Republicans, which Tur noted. We pushed back on the Republicans, we fight against them,  Waters said.  [They] attempt[ed] to go get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau before we came up with the reforms under Dodd-Frank. Tur pushed back. Are Democrats focusing enough on their ideas?  she asked.Waters then went on to explain how effective the Democrat Party has been in their organizing efforts to disrupt town halls where Republican political leaders are speaking to their constituents. Listen, if you have not been keeping up with the town halls that have been going on,  Waters said, referring to the protesters at many Republican town halls, where we have basically organized America around the [Affordable Care Act] and protected Obamacare and the thousands of people who have come out who now are very much informed about the difference between Obamacare and Trumpcare.   WFBWhat Maxine doesn t understand is that when Tea Party members attended town hall meetings across American and challenged their elected leaders on reckless tax legislation they didn t need to be organized by the Republican Party. Tea Party members weren t just targeting Democrat politicians, they were targeting anyone who they felt wasn t representing the people who elected them into office.

PRESIDENT TRUMP Lands in Saudi Arabia to Rare Red Carpet Treatment,"President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia to rare red carpet treatment. What a great way to begin the  President s first foreign trip that will last 9 days.Several symbolic gestures by the Saudis show a sign of respect and friendship. This is very different from when Obama went to Saudi Arabia last year and the kind didn t even come to the airport to greet him. He touched down in the Middle East this morning, hours after tweeting about his excitement for his first  big foreign trip.  Trump flew to the capital Riyadh overnight on Air Force One   becoming the only president to make Saudi Arabia, or any majority Muslim country, his first stop overseas as president. His arrival following a 6,700-mile flight was met with the pomp usually reserved for the likes of a Papal welcome in South America. The president got the red carpet treatment   literally   and some airport workers took off their shoes before manicuring it with brooms in 97-degree heat.Another symbolic gesture by the kingdom: There were 30 U.S. flags at the ready, a tiny fraction of the thousands that line streets and highways between the airport and the city center.The king greeted President Trump at the bottom of the stairs   a very rare scene.A 90-person Royal Saudi Air Forces honor guard practiced rifle drills and then stood at attention while Trump and his kingly escort ambled toward the terminal.Melania and Ivanka Trump seemed determine to make a statement by deplaning without head coverings.This was a  rare sight among women in Riyadh whose main choices are the hijab and the niqab. The King shook First Lady Melania Trump s hand   a rare scene.Still, the first lady stayed a half-dozen steps behind King Salman and her politician-husband, escorted by a lone U.S. Marine in full dress uniform. After a welcome ceremony inside the Royal Terminal, Trump and Salman sat together in  The Beast,  the White House s armored SUV that travels in the belly of Air Force One. The first stop was the glitzy Ritz-Carlton, whose exterior is being lit up at night with giant projected images of the American flag. Trump s first overseas speech is expected to frame the global fight against ISIS and other Islamist terror groups as a  battle between good and evil    but early drafts suggest he will not use the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism.  He will also call on leaders in the Middle East to  drive out terrorists from your places of worship.  Signs of American caution are everywhere as the president who once campaigned on the strength of excluding Muslims from the U.S. ventured into the nation whose king partners in construction with the Bin Laden Group. U.S. military snipers stood guard on nearby jetways. A duplicate Air Force One 747 jet stood by, lest Trump s schedule should be waylaid by engine trouble.Read more: Daily Mail",politics,"May 20, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
OUTRAGE! Student Threatens Violence Against Trump In High School Yearbook Quote,"The double standard here is unbelievable! We just reported on a high school student in big trouble for saying  Build the Wall  in her yearbook quote. That s pretty harmless but the school took back the yearbooks .Fast forward and a high school student wrote out their thoughts on President Trump in the yearbook I would like to behead him. I do not like him. See the huge difference here?MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO)   Just under a month after a Big Lake trap team s photo was banned from the high school yearbook, another high school yearbook photo is making news.For its 2017 yearbook, Brainerd High School dedicated a page to President Donald Trump. Editors asked students their thoughts on the president, and shared the quotes next to their picture.One sophomore said,  I would like to behead him. I do not like him. The photo went viral, sparking controversy on Twitter. Now, that student is telling her side of the story. I was so confused, because at first, I didn t ever remember saying that,  15-year-old Camryn said.Camryn   who asked WCCO not to reveal her last name   says she had no idea a conversation with a classmate last September would lead to nationwide attention. She says the classmate never said she was working for the yearbook when she asked about then-candidate Donald Trump. I did not say,  I want to behead him.  I did not say,  I am going to behead him.  I just said,  Well I m sure we all wouldn t mind him being beheaded,    something along those lines,  Camryn said.  But there was never the direct quote,  I do not like him. I would like to behead him. That conversation exploded on social media 8 months later, with the help of at least one celebrity. Former  Joanie Loves Chachi  actor Scott Baio shared the photo, tagging the president, the FBI, Sean Hannity and Kellyanne Conway.Read more: CBS",politics,"May 20, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
CA: STATE LEGISLATORS Want Traffic Fines To Be Tied To Income…Because Of “Racism”,"Punishing rich, hard-working, white Americans one piece of legislation at a time California s state legislature is considering a bill that would change how the state assess traffic fines. Instead of a flat rate, the state would charge people depending on how much money they made. The less you make, the less you pay.State Senator Robert M. Hertzberg believes California s traffic fines are too high, and the burden is unduly put on low-income families. Many fines, don t even get paid.California is owed almost $10 billion in unpaid traffic fines, something the state tried to chip away at with an amnesty program that would allow violators pay a fraction of what they owe. California s traffic fines are some of the highest in the nation.The report goes on to make the case that the traffic fine system discriminates against poorer individuals thanks to racial profiling by police officers.

"IS SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM PLANNING To Make Hero Out Of Third Rate QB, Race Agitator Colin Kaepernick?","Martin Luther King Jr. would not likely be pleased to see such a divisive figure using his position as a professional athlete to promote a violent and threatening movement funded and promoted by politicians to divide our nation Colin Kaepernick s football career remains very much a question mark, but he s already left an impression on American culture, as his jersey and other gear from his protests in 2016 are now in the hands of the Smithsonian.The Smithsonian s National Museum of African American History and Culture continuously collects items of historic significance from African Americans involved in all phases of American life, and the sociologist and author Harry Edwards encouraged the museum to take a close look at Kaepernick. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback drew nationwide attention last year when he knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality in America.In September, 2016, the union for police officers who work San Francisco home games threatened a boycott of policing the stadium after the 49ers refused to discipline Colin Kaepernick for not standing during the national anthem and for his statements about law enforcement. If the 49ers organization fails to take action to stop this type of inappropriate behavior it could result in police officers choosing not to work at your facilities, the letter reads.  The board of directors of the Santa Clara Police Officer s Association has a duty to protect its members and work to make all of their working environments free of harassing behavior. It also criticized what it called anti-police statements made by Kaepernick, calling them  insulting, inaccurate and completely unsupported by any facts. Edwards arranged for the donation of a jersey and other equipment to the Smithsonian, but did so with a request.  I said,  Don t wait 50 years to try to get some memorabilia and so forth on Kaepernick,  Edwards said, according to USA Today.  Let me give you a game jersey, some shoes, a picture.   And it should be put right there alongside Muhammad Ali. He s this generation s Ali. Daily Wire   Adopted by white parents in Wisconsin, Kaepernick is the biological child of a white woman and a black man. He was born in 1987.Kaepernick explained his refusal to stand for the Star-Spangled Banner, expressing solidarity with the net-marxist racial narratives of Black Lives Matter: I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. Kaepernick describes himself as a black man in a society that  oppresses black people. Kaepernick s refusal to stand for our national anthem was considered anything but brave by many of his fans. Here s a picture of a fan burning Colin s jersey, a trend that was started shortly after Kaepernick used his position to promote the violent Black Lives Matter movement on the field as the other players honored our nation:Kaepernick remains unsigned even as players like Ryan Fitzpatrick sign deals, and there is, of course, the question of how much his very public and very controversial political stances may be harming his marketability.

And they taped him to his chair.

Deputy Attorney General Doubles Down On Comey Memo: “I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it.”,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein doubled down today when he told Congress he stands by a memo he wrote that the White House has cited as a justification for the firing last week of FBI Director James Comey.In closed-door meetings with lawmakers on Thursday and Friday, Rosenstein said he wrote the memo after President Donald Trump told him one day before the May 9 firing that he wanted to dismiss Comey. He said that though he was personally fond of Comey,  I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader. The Justice Department on Friday issued a transcript of Rosenstein s remarks:OPENING STATEMENT:Good afternoon. I welcome the opportunity to discuss my role in the removal of FBI Director James Comey, although I know you understand that I will not discuss the special counsel s ongoing investigation. Most importantly, I want to emphasize my unshakeable commitment to protecting the integrity of every federal criminal investigation. There never has been, and never will be, any political interference in any matter under my supervision in the United States Department of Justice.Before I discuss the events of the past two weeks, I want to provide some background about my previous relationship with former Director Comey. I have known Jim Comey since approximately 2002. In 2005, when Mr. Comey was Deputy Attorney General, he participated in selecting me to serve as a U.S. Attorney. As a federal prosecutor, he was a role model. His speeches about leadership and public service inspired me.On July 5, 2016, Director Comey held his press conference concerning the federal grand jury investigation of Secretary Clinton s emails. At the start of the press conference, the Director stated that he had  not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice . They do not know what I am about to say. Director Comey went on to declare that he would publicly disclose  what we did; what we found; and what we are recommending to the Department of Justice.  He proceeded to disclose details about the evidence; assert that the American people  deserve  to know details; declare that no  reasonable  prosecutor would file charges; and criticize Secretary Clinton.I thought the July 5 press conference was profoundly wrong and unfair both to the Department of Justice and Secretary Clinton. It explicitly usurped the role of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General and the entire Department of Justice; it violated deeply engrained rules and traditions; and it guaranteed that some people would accuse the FBI of interfering in the election.There are lawful and appropriate mechanisms to deal with unusual circumstances in which public confidence in the rule of law may be jeopardized. Such mechanisms preserve the traditional balance of power between investigators and prosecutors, and protect the rights of citizens.Director Comey attended the Maryland U.S. Attorney s Office training seminar on October 27, 2016, and gave a detailed explanation of his reasons for making public statements about the conclusion of the Secretary Clinton email investigation. I strongly disagreed with his analysis, but I believe that he made his decisions in good faith.The next day, October 28, Mr. Comey sent his letter to the Congress announcing that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email investigation. He subsequently has said that he believed he was obligated to send the letter. I completely disagree. He again usurped the authority of the Department of Justice, by sending the letter over the objection of the Department of Justice; flouted rules and deeply engrained traditions; and guaranteed that some people would accuse the FBI of interfering in the election.Before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, 2017, Director Comey testified under oath about his public statements concerning the Secretary Clinton email investigation. I strongly disagreed with his explanations, particularly his assertion that maintaining confidentiality about criminal investigations constitutes concealment. Nonetheless, I respected him personally.Former Department of Justice officials from both political parties have criticized Director Comey s decisions. It was not just an isolated mistake; the series of public statements about the email investigation, in my opinion, departed from the proper role of the FBI Director and damaged public confidence in the Bureau and the Department.In one of my first meetings with then-Senator Jeff Sessions last winter, we discussed the need for new leadership at the FBI. Among the concerns that I recall were to restore the credibility of the FBI, respect the established authority of the Department of Justice, limit public statements and eliminate leaks.On May 8, I learned that President Trump intended to remove Director Comey and sought my advice and input. Notwithstanding my personal affection for Director Comey, I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader.I wrote a brief memorandum to the Attorney General summarizing my longstanding concerns about Director Comey s public statements concerning the Secretary Clinton email investigation.I chose the issues to include in my memorandum.Before finalizing the memorandum on May 9, I asked a senior career attorney on my staff to review it. That attorney is an ethics expert who has worked in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General during multiple administrations. He was familiar with the issues. I informed the senior attorney that the President was going to remove Director Comey, that I was writing a memorandum to the Attorney General summarizing my own concerns, and that I wanted to confirm that everything in my memorandum was accurate. He concurred with the points raised in my memorandum. I also asked several other career Department attorneys to review the memorandum and provide edits.My memorandum is not a legal brief; these are not issues of law.My memorandum is not a finding of official misconduct; the Inspector General will render his judgment about that issue in due course.My memorandum is not a statement of reasons to justify a for-cause termination.My memorandum is not a survey of FBI morale or performance.My memorandum is not a press release.It is a candid internal memorandum about the FBI Director s public statements concerning a high-profile criminal investigation.I sent my signed memorandum to the Attorney General after noon on Tuesday, May 9.I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it.Finally, I want to address the media claims that the FBI asked for additional resources for the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. I am not aware of any such request. Moreover, I consulted my staff and Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, and none of them recalls such a request.END OF TRANSCRIPTThe White House has struggled since Comey s firing to explain the chain of events that led to it and who exactly made the decision. Trump said as recently as Thursday that he acted on a  very strong  recommendation from Rosenstein, but Rosenstein made it clear to Congress that he drafted his memo only after Trump told him of his plans to dismiss the FBI director.He said he did not intend for the document to be a finding of misconduct or a  statement of reasons  to justify the firing, but he added:  I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it.

CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON’S Latest Speech To Be Crashed By Angry HAITIANS Pushing For Answers,"Hillary Clinton always goes back to the black community and this is just another case of pandering. It s pretty sickening that she s even being asked to speak at a college commencement ANY college commencement! The Clinton GRIFTERS also owe the Haitian community answers on where money went after the Haiti earthquake relief effort.  The Haitian community is up in arms over much that happened after the 2010 earthquake. This should be interesting:Here is how the Clinton s used the money that Americans donated to help the devastated residents of Haiti to enrich themselves:On June 8, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to serve as the Class of 2017 commencement speaker at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York, where she will also be awarded an honorary degree. The announcement has incited protests from several members of the Haitian community who plan to protest the speech and are pushing the college s president, Rudy Crew, to rescind the invitation.PANDERING TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN TIMES OF TROUBLE: Every time the Clintons get in a bind, they run to the black community to whitewash their tarnished image,  said Komokoda, the Haitian group protesting the speech, in a statement.  After Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath in the Monica Lewinsky affair, he brought in Jesse Jackson and a host of black preachers to lead prayers with him at the White House. To divert attention from her  deleted emails  debacle, Hillary had Bill DeBlasio s wife, Chirlane McCray, bring her to Brownsville, one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Brooklyn, for a photo op with little black children. When newspaper editorials and cartoons were blasting her for her unending lies and demanding investigations and prosecutions, former New York City mayor David Dinkins brought her out for a keynote speech at his Dinkins Leadership & Public Policy Forum at Columbia University. Today, for her resurrection from a shameful defeat by the last person most reasonable people felt could ever be president of the United States, the dirty work falls to Rudy Crew. HAITI RELIEF SCAM   QUESTIONS REMAIN:The Clintons  role in Haiti has incited immense criticism and has tarnished their relationship with the Haitian community. In 2010, Haiti suffered a massive earthquake. Several NGOs and the United Nations flocked to Haiti to help relief efforts, but their intervention came with several costs. In 2011, UN Peacekeepers caused a massive cholera outbreak that killed at least 9,500 people and sickened 800,000 others. During this time, Bill Clinton served as the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. While the Clinton Foundation has staunchly defended their role in Haiti, their involvement in the country has been far from successful.  Many of the most notable investments the Clintons helped launch, such as the new Marriott in the capital, have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island s ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with,  wrote Jonathan Katz for Politico in 2015.For Komokoda and many Haitians, the Clintons epitomize NGOs and corporations exploiting the crisis and relief efforts in Haiti for their own gain. Haitians also blame the Clintons for the controversial rule of former Haitian President Michel Martelly, who stepped down in February 2016 due to his record of corruption after the Clintons helped him get elected in 2010.MORE ON THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SCAM ON HAITI:Read more: Observer",politics,"May 19, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
GERMANY KICKING RESIDENTS OUT To Make Way For Refugees: Nurse Shocked After Being Kicked Out Of Same Flat For 16 Years,"Stories of governments removing citizens from their homes and apartments in European nations and replacing them with migrants in need of government subsidized housing is becoming more and more common. The Obama regime set the ball in motion for  fair share housing  or social engineering. Will our legislators be able to stop the insanity of displacing citizens who are receiving housing subsidies from our government in favor of refugees or illegal aliens? Having lived in the same flat for 16 years, a German woman is being forced to move out to make way for refugees, because building a new shelter is too expensive. The 51 year-old nurse, who has helped asylum seekers in the past, was shocked by the news.Bettina Halbey, who lives alone in the small town of Nieheim, received a letter from her landlord and the local municipality at the start of September, Die Welt newspaper reported on Thursday. I was completely shocked and I can t even begin to find the words to describe how the city has treated me,  Halbey told the German publication.  I have had to go through a lot of difficulties recently, and then I get this notice. It was like a kick in the teeth. Halbey will have until May 2016 to find a new place to live, along with her dog and her cat. The three-story building, where she rented a 90 sq/m flat will now be turned into accommodation for refugees, who are seeking to make Germany their new home.The mayor of Nieheim, Rainer Vidal, which has a population of just over 6,000, defended the decision to send the nurse packing, saying converting the building would be  the cheapest option. A new residential unit for 30 refugees in Nieheim would cost  30,000 ($33,600). This solution will cost me nothing,  he told Die Welt.Over half the population of Germany lives in rented accommodation and the country has laws to defend the rights of tenants. Normally, only a private individual can terminate the terms of a contract for personal use. A municipality cannot move into a flat as a legal entity, so the process is legally highly questionable,  Ulrich Ropertz, spokesman of the German Tenants  Federation, told the Telegraph.

‘STAY WOKE’? Democrat Lawmakers And Protesters Call For Conservative Websites To Be Banned: “We must insist that our freedom of speech is preserved.”… Huh?,"This is truly where we re heading with freedom of speech in America and it s scary. There are people on the left who want to silence conservatives. The only speech allowed is the speech from the left. Sounds very 1930 s Germany to us. The left wants you to march in lock-step to what they say or they ll beat the h*ll out of you. Just try and wear a  Make America Great Again  hat to a rally and see what the lefties do to you. This is disturbing but what s even more disturbing is that we have lawmakers who are going overboard in their rhetoric Barbara Lee is a great example of this: STAY WOKE!    DEMOCRAT BARBARA LEEDemocratic lawmakers joined alt-left protesters who want to ban conservative news websites at a protest outside of the Federal Communications Commission, Thursday.Rep. Barbara Lee (D. Calif.) told the crowd of protesters and antifa members to  stay woke  in fighting against FCC chairman Ajit Pai s proposal to roll back Obama era net neutrality rules.Politico Pro reported that four Democrats joined the protest, which included members of the alt-left groups who have targeted Pai and held protests in his neighborhood. Politico did not mention protesters wearing masks and identifying themselves as part of the antifa movement. They held signs advocating to ban news websites such as the Drudge Report and Breitbart. We must stay vigilant,  Lee said.  We must insist that our freedom of speech is preserved. Senators Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), Ed Markey (D., Mass.), and Rep. Jared Polis (D., Colo.) also  joined the activists  protesting Pai s proposal, which would bring less regulation for Internet service providers.The FCC voted 2-1 Thursday afternoon to begin the process of reversing net neutrality rules, including Title II, which subjected Internet companies to regulations on how they can manage traffic on their networks. The proposal will now be open to public comment for 90 days.Politico mentioned Protect Our Internet as one of the groups that organized the FCC protest, but failed to mention the group s ties to members of DisruptJ20 and antifa, which have been involved in violent protests against the presidential inauguration and conservative speakers on college campuses.Read more: Washington Free Beacon",politics,"May 18, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
MAXINE DOUBLES DOWN ON CRAZY: MSNBC Host Has Hard Time Keeping Straight Face When Maxine Reveals Who She Believes Fed Trump “Crooked Hillary” and “Lock Her Up” Lines [VIDEO],"The funniest part of the video comes when MSNBC guest host Ben Stein attempts to force Maxine to give an actual reason why President Trump should be impeached and unhinged Maxine goes off on her theory about who came up with the very popular (and accurate) nick-name of  Crooked Hillary  for Hillary Clinton during the campaign. And as a bonus, Waters also embarrassingly admits she thinks the same person is responsible for the term  lock her up  that actually came from Trump s fans at his massive rallies. It s pretty obvious that President Trump and his supporters have gotten so deep under Maxine s thin skin LOL!Stein asked Waters somewhat incredulously if she felt that the Kremlin was involved in developing strategy to sink Hillary Clinton. Just to be clear, we haven t there s been no actual evidence yet of collusion,  said Stein. No, it has not been,  replied Waters. And I want you to know, every time I ve talked about impeachment, I ve said we ve got to connect the dots, we ve got to get the facts, we ve got to do the investigation.

“GOOD-BYE SWEDEN”: How Muslim Violence…Porous Borders And Horrible Health Care Drove Swedish Blogger To U.S.A.,"This blogger s piece is a glimpse into the future of America. Unless we all find a way to stand together and stop Barack Obama and the Democrat party s fundamental transformation from happening we ll be looking for another country who cares more about its citizens than its immigrant population This is the last post on this blog. I am leaving Sweden for good shortly, and will no longer be following its descent from what was once the third most prosperous country in the world. Frankly, it s just too damn depressing.I was born and raised in Sweden, which leaves a cultural mark even though I moved to USA in the 1990s and have spent the better part of my adult life as an American. Coming back for a few years has been a shocking experience.When I was a child, Sweden was a dull yet very safe place to live. Yes, there was a heavy blanket of socialism and collectivist values covering everything, but there was a core of pragmatism beneath the redness. The intention and goal was always to benefit the citizens, even though they went about things in a backwards manner.Prime minister L fven Today, it s as if the inmates are running the asylum. The politicians are participating in a chicken race of  goodness  where everybody tries to one-up each other in caring for the citizens of OTHER countries while Swedish retirees, school children, handicapped and other vulnerable categories of people are thorougly ignored. Violence is exploding. Jihadist Trojan horses are flowing through the porous border along with the tens of thousands ID-less refugees.But what makes me the most pessimistic about Sweden s future is how the social fabric itself has been undermined.Now, to be clear, it is my opinion that modest immigration is healthy for society and beneficial for trade, cultural development and so forth. Protectionism as a concept is counter-productive, while free trade and the ability for skilled labor to go where they re in demand is beneficial for everyone.Having said that, what Sweden is doing is something completely different. The once homogenous population has been forever altered by a rapid and massive addition of people from vastly different cultures and value-systems. 26,8% of the population is now foreign-born or with at least one foreign-born parent, and the national census bureau estimates that some 150 000 per year will arrive to the country of just 9,8 million residents.There simply is no possible way to absorb and assimilate such volumes of people, period. Then you are merely creating ethnic enclaves, which due to incompatible language, culture and job skills become ghettos, which in turns brews crime, misery and extremism. Once the inflow has exceeded the capacity for absorbtion, further immigration only makes the problem worse.It s like someone having read that a cup of green tea per day is healthy, so they make it a policy to chug four gallons per day, every day. It s a good thing overdone to the extreme until it becomes toxic.Then you have the Swedish school system. There really is no nice way to put it; it s a complete disaster. The minister of education is a man-boy who spends his time making Youtube-videos showing heart-signs with his hands to boost school results, while university-level students can t read and comprehend the course literature.Education minister Gustav FridolinSince there is a delay in the changes in the school system, it is only in recent years the full impact of the knowledge-averse  progressive  school system is starting to be felt. Hard facts are largely irrelevant; the important thing is to sit in a group and discuss things until a consensus is reached. But with no hard facts to base the conclusions on, it becomes an exercise in futility because it s all random assumptions and opinions. As a university-level history student (!) was quoted as saying in newspaper Svenska Dagbladet the other day:  Why would all these dates matter? Who cares in what order things happened? That s not exactly fertile soil for creating the researchers and engineers of the future.Financially, Sweden is an oddity in that it never had its real estate correction when Lehman Bros went belly-up and the housing market everywhere in the West crashed. Sweden just kept steaming ahead, which means housing is ridiculously overinflated. In Stockholm, the real estate prices increased 19% and in Gothenburg 24% in the last 12 months alone   from an already sky-high level.Tear-down abandoned house from 1932 with small, unremarkable lot in the outskirts of Stockholm. Current bid: 7,5 million SEK, or close to $900,000.As a result, personal debt of the Swedish population is at an all-time high. To keep all this afloat the normal mortgage interest rates are at 2% with central bank Riksbanken at -0,25%, and yet a significant portion of the borrowers are hanging by a thread. If and when foreign banks and investors decide it s time to turn their backs on Sweden (as happened in the early 1990s) there s going to be a lot of pain.Then you have the financial obligations going forward. Like much of the western world, there is a demographic change where fewer tax-paying adults are to support a glut of retirees. What makes it especially dire for Sweden is that in addition to the old Swedes, there s also a ton of elderly immigrants that are granted  family visas  based on younger relatives having been granted asylum. They ve never paid a dime in taxes, yet enter the system with full benefits from day one. In theory, this would be made up for by the younger relatives working and paying taxes. Sadly, this is not the case; while ethnical Swedes have a 82% employment rate, immigrants only have 57% with non-Europeans coming in at just 51%.If Sweden was a person, it d be like the guy with three mortgages, seven maxed-out credit cards and four collection agencies chasing him that just signed a lease for a brand new BMW X6. Simply put, there s a lot of red ink in the future; it just hasn t been fully realized yet.Finally, there s the sorry state of the Swedish defense. After decades of constant slashing of the defense budget, the extent of Swedish ambition is to stall an invader for a week in a limited area. This with war raging in Europe, Russian missiles pointed at Sweden in Kaliningrad, and Russian submarines and bomber jets openly thumbing their nose at Sweden as they intrude on Swedish territory on a regular basis. The power vacuum in Scandinavia is so tangible you can almost hear a sucking sound as you fly over it. This, too, will require massive investments when the penny finally drops amongst Swedish politicians.So while I can t claim to be any kind of authority on macroeconomics or social predictive models, I see red lights across the board.In some ways, I d compare the country to a farm. Previously, Sweden acted like a sensible farmer and planted wheat here, carrots there, potatoes over there et cetera, by implementing free schooling, sound infrastructure investments, state-financed research and so forth. A few decades later, they reaped the rewards and climbed the prosperity ladder.In the late 1960s, this pragmatic line was abandoned as leftist idealist Olof Palme took over. But there was plenty to harvest from previous years, so Sweden continued to be the land of milk and honey for a good long while. Then things started drying up, and the process has been one of gradual erosion and decline since the 1990s.The famous Swedish health care system is a good example. 120 000 hospital beds in the late 1960s became 20 000 today. Cancer patients are put on waiting lists for months. Entire emergency wards shut down for summer. The crumbling Swedish railroad system is another symptom I examined in-depth last year. The aforementioned defense that now consist of about three fat generals and a rusty rifle (bullets withheld for budgetary reasons).A sensible farmer would see the problems for what they are and hurry to plant new seeds, so as to return to bountiful harvests of wheat, carrots, potatoes etc. Instead, the Swedish politicians goes by dogma and plants what they think SHOULD grow. So they plant M & Ms, hot dogs and pretzels. The results won t be fully evident for a few years yet, but as the last reserves of the old harvests are depleted, things will get  Interesting.From what I can see, there simply is no plausible scenario where these social tensions and future financial committments will not lead to a downward spiral of hardship and strife. I hope I m wrong. I really do, because I have friends and family I care about that will remain here to see it all play out.But I won t. I ll be back in the US being mad at Obama for being a lying scumbag. And if Trump manages to get elected in 2016? Whoo boy. A racist ignoramus who takes pride in the worst qualities of a cranky eight-year old should make George  Dumbo  Bush seem like Abe Lincoln by comparison. So every country has its problems. USA has its corrupt yokel in office, just as Sweden has Stefan L fven.

BREAKING: FORMER FBI DIRECTOR Appointed By Jeff Session’s DOJ For “Russia Probe”,"PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST PUT THIS TO BED! The leakers are hopefully going to be exposed now (see statement below) that the DOJ has appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller III as special counsel to its investigation into possible Russian interference in our presidential election. The Wall Street Journal reported:Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the appointment because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigation related to the 2016 race. Mr. Rosenstein said in a statement that  I determined that it is in the public interest for me to exercise my authority and appoint a Special Counsel to assume responsibility of this matter.  He cautioned that his decision wasn t the result of a  finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted. He signed the order on Wednesday. Mr. Mueller, a former federal prosecutor, served as FBI director from 2001 through 2013 and has a reputation for independence. Mr. Mueller has been a partner a WilmerHale, a law firm, but is stepping down from his role there to avoid any conflicts of interest, according to the Justice Department.NOTICE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT STATEMENT states that they will investigate  related matters  which opens up a can of worms for the leakers.

LEGAL EXPERT JONATHAN TURLEY Shoots Down Joe Scarborough’s Case Against Trump: “Not obstruction” [Video],"Legal Expert Jonathan Turley listened as Joe Scarborough laid out a lengthy timeline to make a case of obstruction on President Trump. His response is awesome and very precise in its reasons for not recommending obstruction charges. Turley is a Democrat but is a very fair legal expert who rules according to the law how refreshing! While the left freaks out about nothing, the people like Turley who are REALLY qualified to judge this are saying it s a nothingburger. We don t even have evidence of wrongdoing but talk of impeachment is all over the place.Please sit back, relax and listen to the voice of reason Professor Jonathan Turley: There was  ample reason  to fire Sally Yates when, as acting Attorney General, she instructed the Department of Justice not to enforce President Trump s executive order on immigration.  Obstruction of justice requires that you act to obstruct or interfere usually with a judicial or congressional proceeding, neither of which was pending at this time.   You also tend to show it was done for a corrupt, or corruptly, to use the statutory term. This doesn t meet the usual definition of that.

CLASSIC! GREG GUTFELD Rips Comey Memo Disclosure As “Very Mean Girls”…You Will Love This! [Video],"GREG GUTFELD IS SO PASSIONATE and so on target with his commentary about the Comey memo disclosure. This is truly epic! Gutfeld said all of this comes down to the non-political way Trump communicates. When you say you  hope  for something, it s not a command. It s not saying you d better do this. Gutfeld then compared the use of  hope  to desiring a bicycle for Christmas, wanting people to show up for your birthday, and asking neighbors to be quiet while you re sleeping. In my mind   it seems like it s not a big deal, which is maybe why Comey didn t think it was obstructionist, so he didn t have to comply to reporting it, because he knew   what Trump was doing is what Trump does. Everything to him is like visiting a construction site. It s not what a politician says or does. He doesn t understand how internal stuff works. So he shows up and says I wish we could do this for cheaper   wish we could have done a better job on lights on bathrooms.

CHECKMATE! PUTIN Offers Up Proof Of Trump’s Innocence [Video],"Putin just trolled the Democrats Haha!Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump had not divulged any secrets during a meeting in Washington with Russian officials and offered to prove it by supplying Congress with a transcript.But a leading U.S. Republican politician said he would have little faith in any notes Putin might supply.Two U.S. officials said on Monday Trump had disclosed classified information about a planned Islamic State operation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov when they met last week, plunging the White House into a fresh controversy just four months into Trump s tenure.Trump, whose administration has been dogged by allegations that Russia helped him win the White House and that he and his allies are too cozy with Moscow, has defended his decision to discuss intelligence with the Russians after media reports of the meeting alarmed some U.S. and foreign politicians.President Putin deployed his trademark sarcasm on Wednesday to make clear he thought the accusation that Trump had divulged secrets absurd. I spoke to him (Lavrov) today,  a smiling Putin told a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. I ll be forced to issue him (Lavrov) with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us. Not with me, nor with representatives of Russia s intelligence services. It was very bad of him. This was obvious sarcasm by Putin who is probably looking at the Democrats with disgust.

DETECTIVE ON SETH RICH Murder Mystery Drops Shocking News [Video],"Rod Wheeler was on Hannity last night with startling information on the Seth Rich murder mystery. He spoke about the mystery of why they can t locate the computer Rich used. They went on to discuss clues in the case that point to collusion between the DC police and the DNC. The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says this:Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? The plot thickens in this case. Will we finally find the murderer of this young man and who is behind it?IN CASE YOU HAVEN T SEEN UPDATES ON THIS CASE:CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL: SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist, Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founder DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To  Stand Down  On Case [VIDEO]Wow! The private investigator hired by the Rich family to look into the death of 27-year old murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich just revealed some stunning evidence. It s been confirmed that over 44,000 emails and over 17,000 attachments were sent to the now deceased investigative journalist and best friend of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Now that this new information has been made available to the public, will the media be asking Hillary or the DNC any questions about their involvement in Rich s death? Will the DOJ be opening an investigation into his death in light of this new stunning evidence? What about the alleged Russian hack of the DNC emails that the media tried to tie to President Trump?Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election:Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange (and his closest friend in London), to WikiLeaks' Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell and many others.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed. My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  Wheeler said.  I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.   FOX NewsWe reported on this story extensively. Here are some of our stunning findings over the past 10 months. It s pretty stunning that it took so long to find out about the e-mails on Rich s laptop: Conspiracy theories have been surrounding the murder of Seth Rich. They reached a new frenzy after the hacking of DNC e-mails led to the resignation of its chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Rich was beaten, shot and killed early on the morning of July 8 while he was walking home and talking on the phone to his girlfriend. Police have said they haven t determined if his murder was a botched robbery or something else. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone.Wikileaks just confirmed murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leak.Wikileaks released a series direct messages from US alleged  Russian spy  Guccifer 2.0 to actress model Robbin Young (according to Young).In the stream of texts the discussion leads to the DNC leaker.His name is  Seth ** In November Julian Assange said Russia did not hack into the DNC servers. -h/t GP Here s the proof:Direct Messages from U.S. alleged Russian spy @GUCCIFER_2 to actress-model @robbin_young (according to the latter) https://t.co/uMsB9WgxRQ  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 8, 2017Actress Robbin Young claims she had given this information she received from Guccifer 2.0 to the authorities but,  no one cared :https://twitter.com/Robbin_Young/status/850743524953702404Actress Robbin Young states that Guccifer 2.0 told her,  i m eager to find facts about seth, i m sure it wasn t just a robbery. seth was assassinated. :Guccifer 2.0 said, ""i'm eager to find fact about seth, i'm sure it wasn't just a robbery. seth was assassinated."" #SethRich  Robbin Young (@Robbin_Young) March 29, 2017In June 2016,the hacker Guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for breaking into the Democratic National Committee s servers, lifting opposition research the DNC had gathered, including a 200-page document focused on presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The hacker s moniker is an homage to  Guccifer,  the nom de guerre of Romanian hacker Marcel Lazar who claimed a previous hack into Hillary Clinton s private email server and is now awaiting prosecution for cybercrimes.  RTWhile Wikileaks  Julian Assange was being interviewed by John Pilger, he brought up the death of Seth Rich. Watch Assange s strange and somewhat cagey reply.Here is part of the conversation:Julian Assange: Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks. As a 27 year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.Reporter: That was just a robbery, I believe. Wasn t it?Julian Assange: No. There s no finding. So  I m suggesting that our sources take risks.Watch it again in slow motion below:Seth Rich s parents explain what happened only moments before his death. He was the Voter Expansion Data Director for the DNC. His parents say he was,  Making sure everyone who wanted to vote, had the opportunity :Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a  lead  saying that Rich was en route to the FBI that fateful morning, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an  ongoing court case  possibly involving the Clinton family.More recently, Wikileaks s thousands of DNC emails and voice mails have piqued Reddit s interest, with Redditors combing through years of communications looking for any clue to Rich s murder.The theory is apparently based on Julian Assange s recent ITV appearance, where he scoffed at the idea that Russian hackers could be responsible for the data dump, and said that  anyone  within the Democrats  organization could easily have sent Wikileaks the offending messages.Given that Rich as a DNC staffer presumably would have had some access to its servers, Reddit is absolutely positive Rich paid the ultimate price for exposing Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC s crusade against Bernie Sanders.

SETH RICH MURDER Has CHILLING SIMILARITIES To Clinton Body Count Victims,"Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder.

Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].Just as in the Rich case, several of the people who died mysterious deaths were shot spontaneously and in public places, sometimes from behind, sometimes by unknown assailants and often just before they were set to release incriminating evidence concerning the Clintons  activities. In most cases, there were no signs of theft at the crime scenes. And while some of the deaths were ruled suicides, other cases remain a mystery.Rich worked for the Democratic National Committee as a data analyst and reportedly sent more than 44,000 DNC emails to WikiLeaks, including 17,761 attachments, from January 2015 through the end of May 2016. As WND reported, the DNC staffer had been in contact with WikiLeaks Director Gavin MacFadyen, who died just 17 days before the election of lung cancer.Rich was mysteriously shot and killed July 10, 2016. As WND reported, Rich was murdered near his affluent neighborhood in Washington, D.C. He was shot in the back with a handgun at 4:18 a.m. while he walked home, and nothing was taken from him. Rich, who called several people as he later walked home, was talking on the phone with his girlfriend, Kelsey Murka, when he was accosted a block from his house. He was transported to a local hospital and was pronounced dead at 5:57 a.m. If it was a robbery it failed because he still has his watch, he still has his money, he still has his credit cards, still had his phone, so it was a wasted effort except we lost a life,  said Rich s father, Joel, shortly after the bizarre murder.On July 22, just 12 days after Rich s death and days before the Democratic Party Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks released 20,000 emails from DNC officials.Those leaked emails revealed, among other things, that the DNC tried to tip the scales in favor of Hillary Clinton s campaign and prevent Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders from becoming the party s nominee. The leaks were cited by some Democrats as one explanation for Clinton s election loss. Many accused the Russians of  hacking  and turning the tide for then-GOP candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 election.In one email released by WikiLeaks, Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta said he d like to  make an example  out of the person who leaked the emails. I m definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it,  Podesta wrote on Feb. 22, 2015, according to WikiLeaks.Only days after Rich s murder, Hillary Clinton cited the DNC staffer s death in her speech advocating for more gun control. From Sandy Hook to Orlando to Dallas, and so many other places, these tragedies tear at our soul,  Clinton said in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on July 12.  And so do the incidents that don t even dominate the headlines. Just this past Sunday, a young man, Seth Rich, who worked for the Democratic National Committee to expand voting rights, was shot and killed in his neighborhood in Washington. He was just 27 years old.   Surely we can agree that weapons of war have no place on the streets of America. The bizarre shooting of Rich shares some similarities with other murders listed in WND s exclusive report,  Clinton death list : 33 spine-tingling cases.  Many of the individuals included in the list were shot to death, though some of the deaths were ruled to be suicides. Others were killed in plane crashes, car wrecks and freak accidents.Vince Foster was deputy White House counsel and Hillary s friend and law partner who had connections to the Clintons  Travelgate and Whitewater scandals. In 1993, Foster was found dead in a park with a fatal gunshot wound to his mouth. As WND reported, his suicide was the subject of much speculation and three official investigations.Investigations by the U.S. Park Police, the Department of Justice, the FBI, Congress, Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr concluded Foster s death was a suicide. However, as WND reported in 2003, one of Starr s key investigators challenged the official line, insisting the probe s result was predetermined, only a few plotters were required to engineer the result, the crime scene was altered and that major newspaper editors killed stories by reporters pursuing the truth. The Washington Post reported that federal investigators were not allowed to enter Foster s office after his death, but  White House aides enter[ed] Foster s office shortly after his death, giving rise to speculation that files were removed from his office. In his 2005 book  The Truth about Hillary: What She Knew, When She Knew It, And How Far She ll Go to Become President,  Edward Klein wrote of Hillary s involvement in the effort to remove Foster s files:As WND reported in February 2016, recently discovered evidence unearthed from boxes stored deep in the National Archives lend credence to theories about foul play and cover-up that have been hinted at by at least three books and countless articles.The newest piece to the puzzle was uncovered by two citizen researchers, one of whom was a witness involved in the case from the beginning. What had only been suspicions about missing death-scene photographs are now listed as facts in public documents.The smoking-gun information comes from two documents: a two-page letter of resignation and a 31-page memo both written by Starr s lead prosecutor, Miguel Rodriguez.Rodriguez refers in his letter to photographs showing a wound on Foster s neck   a wound that did not exist according to accounts in Starr s official government report.The obvious questions: How could a suicide victim be found with two wounds   a .38-caliber gunshot into the mouth that exited through his head and another wound on the right side of his neck that one of the paramedics described as a small-caliber bullet hole? And why would the government investigators go to great lengths to cover it up?Jerry Luther Parks: Shot in chest by mysterious gunmanTwo months after Foster died, Jerry Luther Parks   who had been head of security for Bill Clinton s headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas, during the 1992 presidential campaign and gubernatorial years  was shot through the rear window of his car with a semiautomatic handgun.As WND reported, Jerry Luther Parks was reportedly watching a news bulletin on the death of Foster when he turned from the television and muttered,  I m a dead man. His son, Gary, was with him in the room. It was July 21, 1993. Foster had just been found dead in Fort Marcy Park, about seven miles from the White House, across the Potomac River in Virginia. Foster had been shot through the head, said the bulletin, an apparent suicide.British journalist Ambrose Evans-Pritchard interviewed the Parks family extensively. In  The Secret Life of Bill Clinton,  he reported that Parks was a nervous wreck for the next two months. He packed a gun and drove evasively to shake off any possible pursuers. At one point, Parks told his family that Bill Clinton was  cleaning house  and that he was  next on the list. On Sept. 23, 1993, as Parks was driving to his suburban Little Rock home along the Chenal Parkway, a white Chevrolet Caprice with two men inside drove alongside and peppered Parks  car with semiautomatic gunfire. Parks  car ground to a halt. A man emerged from the white Chevy, fired two rounds into Parks  chest with a 9-mm pistol, then sped off.Several witnesses watched the murder. The killers were never found. As with so many other  Arkancides    the name given to the long list of suspicious deaths among Arkansas associates of the Clintons   Big Media ignored the event.One of the last people to see Foster alive was Linda Tripp, who then worked as a secretary for Foster s boss, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum. Tripp testified before Kenneth Starr s grand jury on July 28, 1998, that the reason she had leaked Monica Lewinsky s story to Michael Isikoff at Newsweek was that Tripp hoped the spotlight of national publicity might protect her from physical harm. I am afraid of this administration,  Tripp told the grand jury.She continued:  I have what I consider to be well-founded fears of what they are capable of   I had reasons to believe that the Vince Foster tragedy was not depicted accurately under oath by members of the administration   I knew based on personal knowledge, personal observations, that they were lying under oath. So it became very fearful to me that I had information even back then that was dangerous. A juror asked,  But do you have any examples of violence being done by the administration to people who were a threat to them? Tripp named Jerry Parks:  [T]he behavior in the West Wing with senior staff to the president during the time the Jerry Parks [murder report] came over the fax frightened me. He had been killed, she said.The  flurry of activity,  the closed-door meetings and the  hush-hush  atmosphere in the White House all struck her as ominous and frightening. Maybe you had to be there,  said Tripp. [The news of Parks  death] was something they wanted to get out in front of. There was talk that this would be another body to add to the list of 40 bodies or something that were associated with the Clinton administration. At that time, I didn t know what that meant. I have since come to see such a list. After the murder, Gary Parks told a staffer of the New York Observer his father and Vince Foster had investigated Clinton s affairs at Hillary s request. He said that Vince Foster had called up his father, who was working as a private investigator, to look into Clinton s romantic life in about 1980, after Bill Clinton had lost the governor s office following his first term. Parks said Hillary wanted a divorce. It looked like maybe the juggernaut she d believed in, and married, was over. Clinton had by then lost two big races and won two. Till the Comeback Kid   boy is Bill Clinton gutsy   won back the governorship in 1982. But in the early 80s, Parks said, Hillary asked her law partner Vince Foster to prepare a divorce case and Foster called Parks, who compiled a dossier of women s statements. Parks said that Hillary later decided against a divorce, but that his father held on to the dossier. Then in 1993, Parks said, after Vince Foster went to Washington, he demanded the return of the file, and even called Jerry Parks in the days before his, Foster s, death, to demand it. And that two months later his father was murdered, because, Parks said, he had held out on returning the file. (The L.R. police never solved his father s murder, not when I was looking into it a few years afterward.) John Hillyer: Mysterious timing of deathNBC cameraman John Hillyer had been working on an investigation of a drug-smuggling operation in Mena, Arkansas, while Clinton was the state s governor. He also helped with a 30-minute video called  Circle of Power  and  The Clinton Chronicles. As WND reported, video journalist Pat Matrisciana (producer of  The Clinton Chronicles ) began working on the film project in the early 1990s, he didn t realize what he and his cameraman were getting into. I had been contacted by a man named John Hillyer, an NBC cameraman who wanted to tell the real story about what was happening in Arkansas,  he said.When Matrisciana and Hillyer arrived in Arkansas and began interviewing people for the video, the criminality and intrigue were far worse than they had imagined. It was like going into some sort of banana republic that was run by a dictatorship,  he said.  We were followed on a regular basis. Matrisciana set up a  safe house  in an apartment complex in Little Rock where he and other journalists and investigators would meet to discuss stories of drug trafficking in Mena, the murder of two teenage boys there and whether or not Bill Clinton was involved in any of those activities.Hillyer and Matrisciana developed a friendship with Gary Parks, the son of Jerry Luther Parks, a former security chief of Clinton s presidential campaign. According to Matrisciana, Jerry Parks had been hired several years earlier by Foster on behalf of Hillary Clinton to put Bill Clinton under constant surveillance. Gary would go on surveillance stakeouts with his father as Jerry gathered photographic evidence of Clinton visiting with prostitutes, Gennifer Flowers and other women.When Foster s body was found in Fort Marcy Park, Jerry became paranoid that he might also be targeted for murder. He was right. When Jerry was assassinated in his car in September 1993, Gary and Jerry s widow believed it was related to his surveillance of Clinton.Gary Parks regularly stayed at the safe house, but was awakened one night when the door was kicked open by would-be assassins. When he quickly loaded his M-1 carbine, the sound of the bullet being chambered scared off the killers and they fled into the parking lot. Gary went to the window and thought he recognized one of the men as a member of the Gov. Clinton s security staff.On another occasion, when Matrisciana and others were preparing for a radio talk show at the safe house, an investigator scanned the apartment for  bugs  and discovered eight of them.During the course of their investigation, Matrisciana and Hillyer discovered a trail of unsolved murders of people who knew details about the teens  deaths. Others who died mysteriously had inside information on drug ties to the political establishment in Arkansas. On one occasion, Hillyer was planning to conduct an interview with a former official of the Democratic National Committee, but the man never showed up for the interview. Hillyer learned the next day that the man, C. Victor Raiser II, and his son, Montgomery Raiser, had died in a plane crash.Matrisciana and Hillyer were also going to interview a hermit who lived in the mountains near where the teens had been killed. Two days before the scheduled interview, the hermit died.Hillyer started to fear for his own life, telling Matrisciana that he thought they would kill him by making it look like he had a heart attack. After the film was completed, Hillyer went on to other projects and ended up living in Atlanta. In 1996, Matrisciana received a phone call from Hillyer. John told him he had uncovered new information that needed to be put on video, but that they couldn t talk on an unsecured phone. They planned on meeting to discuss the new information, but Hillyer died of a heart attack three days later, on Nov. 29, 1996.Did someone get to Hillyer? Matrisciana doesn t know. Were the hermit and DNC official killed for what they knew? Or were these simply coincidences? Again, Matriciana said he doesn t know, but he did think the deaths were unusual, considering the number of other people who have died under mysterious circumstances in Arkansas.Blacklisted News -On July 3, attorney Shawn Lucas, 38, helped serve the DNC with a lawsuit claiming then-DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz  rigged the primary for Hillary Clinton. The complaint was served before Wasserman Schultz resigned amid the Wikileaks email scandal on July 24.Less than one month after he helped serve the lawsuit, Lucas  girlfriend found him dead in his bathroom.Beverly Ann Fields, chief of staff at the Washington, D.C., Medical Examiner s office, told WND,  The cause and manner of death for decedent [Shawn] Lucas are still pending. Victor Thorn authored four books on the Clintons:  Hillary (and Bill): The Sex Volume,  Hillary (and Bill): The Drugs Volume,   Hillary (and Bill): The Murder Volume  and  Crowning Clinton: Why Hillary Shouldn t Be in the White House.  Thorn reportedly committed suicide with a gun on his 54th birthday on a mountaintop in Pennsylvania.Inquisitr reported that Thorn made several appearances on  The Russell Scott Show  and told the host,  Russell, if I m ever found dead, it was murder. I would never kill myself. As WND reported, Joe Montano, who served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee before Debbie Wasserman Schultz and was an aide to Hillary s running-mate, Tim Kaine, reportedly died of a heart attack after the Wikileaks DNC email dump. Montano was only 47.Former United Nations General Assembly President John Ashe was found dead in His New York home, and the cause of death was reported as a heart attack, as WND reported. But the local Dobbs Ferry police said  his throat had been crushed, presumably by a barbell he dropped while pumping iron. The death by barbell of disgraced U.N. official John Ashe could become a bigger obsession for conspiracy theorists than Vince Foster s 1993 suicide,  the report by Richard Johnson said.It s because Ashe was scheduled to testify in just days with Chinese businessman and co-defendant Ng Lap Seng, who was accused of smuggling $4.5 million into the U.S. and lying that it was to buy casino chips and more.The New York Post said Ng earlier was identified in a 1998 Senate document  as the source of hundreds of thousands of dollars illegally funneled through an Arkansas restaurant owner, Charlie Trie, to the Democratic National Committee during the Clinton administration. One source told me,  Johnson wrote,  During the trial, the prosecutors would have linked Ashe to the Clinton bagman Ng. It would have been very embarrassing. His death was conveniently timed. Gareth Williams, a transatlantic MI6 spy   whose dead body was found naked, padlocked and stuffed in a 32-inch by 19-inch duffel bag that was sitting in his London bathtub   had illegally hacked secret data on Bill Clinton, according to the U.K. Sun. The news site noted,  [H]is death is still one of Britain s most mysterious unsolved cases. Scotland Yard had announced the death as a suicide, saying he locked himself in the bag.But his DNA wasn t found on the lock. There were no palm prints on the edge of his bathtub.For the entire chilling list of people who crossed the Clinton s and ended up dead, go to WND ",politics,"May 16, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
UPDATE: UNDER PRESSURE? MISS USA Just Flip Flopped On Healthcare [VIDEO],"The glowing review we gave to Miss USA Kara McCullough must be revoked Bummer!She was our hero when she defended liberty from the liberals who believe healthcare is not a right but a privilege. Liberals wasted no time exploding in rage, seeing it as an intolerable betrayal of their ideology by someone who had an advantage in the pursuit of her crown due to political correctness. Today we see this: I am privileged to have health care. I do believe it should be a right.   @MissUSA 2017 K ra McCullough  clarifies  response. #MissUSA pic.twitter.com/QCc7irmmmq  Good Morning America (@GMA) May 16, 2017If healthcare is to be a  right for all worldwide,  you had better open up your wallet. Places like Uganda cannot be provided with modern healthcare on a coercive basis at the national level. Socialism has always been globalist in its redistributive aspirations.Hot Air says maybe she really is clarifying rather than reversing what she actually meant:Her answer on Sunday night   wasn t all that coherent ( to all the American citizens worldwide ?). She may have heard the word  privilege  and, in the stress of the moment, processed it not in the legal sense but in the colloquial sense, as a synonym for gratitude for one s good fortune. E.g., it s a privilege to be a citizen of the greatest country in the world, I m privileged to have a wonderfully supportive family, what a privilege to have good medical care through your job, etc. A pageant contestant wants to project graciousness, so that s what she did.Or maybe she was taken to the woodshed for an attitude adjustment, and came back a commie.Via: moonbattery",politics,"May 16, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

It s uncanny that the media could be so coordinated in their reports on President Trump Of course, we believe there s something to that.Two  Congresscritters  have come out to call for the impeachment of President Trump .With ZERO evidence of ANY wrongdoing, it s laughable One of our favorites is Maxine Waters but this next Congressman runs a close second. Al Green claims Trump was  hobnobbing  with the Russians Haha!Congressman Al Green just released a statement on why he believes President Trump should be impeached. This statement is laughable. Was Al Green elected because of his name? Voters can be that way, ya know This guy is the definition of clueless! Who elects these brainiacs?Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) has suggested impeachment during TV interviews, but Green is the first member of Congress to formally call for impeachment hearings.Green said Trump s own public statements showed he fired Comey over the Russia investigation, which he said was grounds for impeachment:Waters and Green are a total joke!

"CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL: SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist, Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founder…DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To “Stand Down” On Case [VIDEO]","Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election:Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange (and his closest friend in London), to WikiLeaks' Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell and many others.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed. My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  Wheeler said.  I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.   FOX NewsWe reported on this story extensively. Here are some of our stunning findings over the past 10 months. It s pretty stunning that it took so long to find out about the e-mails on Rich s laptop: Conspiracy theories have been surrounding the murder of Seth Rich. They reached a new frenzy after the hacking of DNC e-mails led to the resignation of its chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Rich was beaten, shot and killed early on the morning of July 8 while he was walking home and talking on the phone to his girlfriend. Police have said they haven t determined if his murder was a botched robbery or something else. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone.Wikileaks just confirmed murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leak.Wikileaks released a series direct messages from US alleged  Russian spy  Guccifer 2.0 to actress model Robbin Young (according to Young).In the stream of texts the discussion leads to the DNC leaker.His name is  Seth ** In November Julian Assange said Russia did not hack into the DNC servers. -h/t GP Here s the proof:Direct Messages from U.S. alleged Russian spy @GUCCIFER_2 to actress-model @robbin_young (according to the latter) https://t.co/uMsB9WgxRQ  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 8, 2017Actress Robbin Young claims she had given this information she received from Guccifer 2.0 to the authorities but,  no one cared :https://twitter.com/Robbin_Young/status/850743524953702404Actress Robbin Young states that Guccifer 2.0 told her,  i m eager to find facts about seth, i m sure it wasn t just a robbery. seth was assassinated. :Guccifer 2.0 said, ""i'm eager to find fact about seth, i'm sure it wasn't just a robbery. seth was assassinated."" #SethRich  Robbin Young (@Robbin_Young) March 29, 2017In June 2016,the hacker Guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for breaking into the Democratic National Committee s servers, lifting opposition research the DNC had gathered, including a 200-page document focused on presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The hacker s moniker is an homage to  Guccifer,  the nom de guerre of Romanian hacker Marcel Lazar who claimed a previous hack into Hillary Clinton s private email server and is now awaiting prosecution for cybercrimes.  RTWhile Wikileaks  Julian Assange was being interviewed by John Pilger, he brought up the death of Seth Rich. Watch Assange s strange and somewhat cagey reply.Here is part of the conversation:Julian Assange: Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks. As a 27 year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.Reporter: That was just a robbery, I believe. Wasn t it?Julian Assange: No. There s no finding. So  I m suggesting that our sources take risks.Watch it again in slow motion below:Seth Rich s parents explain what happened only moments before his death. He was the Voter Expansion Data Director for the DNC. His parents say he was,  Making sure everyone who wanted to vote, had the opportunity :Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a  lead  saying that Rich was en route to the FBI that fateful morning, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an  ongoing court case  possibly involving the Clinton family.More recently, Wikileaks s thousands of DNC emails and voice mails have piqued Reddit s interest, with Redditors combing through years of communications looking for any clue to Rich s murder.The theory is apparently based on Julian Assange s recent ITV appearance, where he scoffed at the idea that Russian hackers could be responsible for the data dump, and said that  anyone  within the Democrats  organization could easily have sent Wikileaks the offending messages.Given that Rich as a DNC staffer presumably would have had some access to its servers, Reddit is absolutely positive Rich paid the ultimate price for exposing Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC s crusade against Bernie Sanders.

Shame on them!CURRENT FCC CHAIRMAN AJIT PAI STOOD UP TO THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS WHEN THEY WERE TOLD NOT TO RELEASE INFORMATION ON FRAUD IN THE LIFELINE PROGRAM:TYRANNY: Obamaphone Fraud Kept Under Wraps Until Vote To Expand ProgramFederal regulators were instructed to keep a massive fraud investigation under wraps until a day after a controversial vote to expand a program that was allegedly used to bilk taxpayers of tens of millions of dollars, one those regulators claims.The Federal Communications Commission on Friday announced that it would seek $51 million in damages from a cell phone company that allegedly defrauded the federal Lifeline program of nearly $10 million.The commission s five members unanimously backed the Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL), but Republican commissioner Ajit Pai parted from his colleagues in a partial dissent. According to Pai, he and other commissioners were told not to reveal the details of its investigation until April 1, a day after the FCC voted to expand the Lifeline program. Commissioners were told that the Notice of Apparent Liability could not be released or publicly discussed until April 1, 2016, conveniently one day after the Commission was scheduled to expand the Lifeline program to broadband,  Pai wrote.  That s not right. Pai did not say who issued that directive. However, it had the effect of preventing public knowledge of widespread fraud in the Lifeline program ahead of a contentious vote on expanding it despite persisting concerns about a lack of internal safeguards.FCC spokesman Will Wiquist insisted that the timing was completely coincidental.

WATCH DEMOCRATS Repeat Exact Same Phrase On Fake Trump/Russian Story [Video],"The Democrats just keep on pushing the FAKE NEWS of Trump colluding with the russians to win the election. The striking thing is the coordination in talking points. Unreal! They must email every person to push over and over the same words so we re all brainwashed to believe the lies:Earlier in the week, the line was  crisis of confidence The Democrats are way too predictable!CNN decided it was a good time to declare  a crisis in confidence  with the trump administration What a joke! The firing of Comey was nothing of the sort! when Democrats called for coney s firing for months and then Trump finally fires him, how can that be a bad thing for Democrats? It s not they re just playing politics:CNN Reported: A president who thrives on crises has created the biggest one yet of his presidency.President Trump s decision to fire James Comey creates a crisis of confidence around the federal government on a level that most likely hasn t been seen since Watergate. With the tangled threads of Russian influence, last year s presidential election and an active FBI investigation, Trump s move will test loyalties and force a moment of truth for his Republican allies and his Justice Department.No one is seriously questioning whether the president acted within his authority, and the White House s official explanation for what transpired is straightforward enough. According to that version of events, the attorney general and deputy attorney general recommended Comey s ouster, and the president quickly agreed and acted accordingly.",politics,"May 15, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
‘NOT WITTINGLY’ JAMES CLAPPER Reveals Anti-Trump-Bitterness: “Our Institutions Are Under Assault” [Video],"All you have to do is listen to Clapper lie before Congress and you know he has ZERO credibility to speak:Remember the famous moment when US NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CHIEF James Clapper was testifying about the NSA surveillance of Americans when he let slip a sign he was not being truthful. Of course, we knew this was all a smoke and mirrors show. Clapper later said he  misspoke last we checked it s pretty much the same thing as lying NOT WITTINGLY    JAMES CLAPPERHere s the video below where he parses words in his testimony: Clapper took over in 2010 heading up 17 different intelligence agencies. His tenure was marked by the Edward Snowden leaks on US intelligence. He s always said he d resign at the end of Obama s presidency but we re wondering if he s jumping before Trump appointees arrive. Clapper and Gen. Mike Flynn have a history that s not so perfect:Two years ago, I was called into a meeting with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence, and after some  niceties,  I was told by the USDI that I was being let go from DIA. It was definitely an uncomfortable moment (I suspect more for them than me).I asked the DNI (Gen. James Clapper) if my leadership of the agency was in question and he said it was not; had it been, he said, they would have relieved me on the spot.I knew then it had more to do with the stand I took on radical Islamism and the expansion of al Qaeda and its associated movements. I felt the intel system was way too politicized, especially in the Defense Department. After being fired, I left the meeting thinking,  Here we are in the middle of a war, I had a significant amount of combat experience (nearly five years) against this determined enemy on the battlefield and served at senior levels, and here it was, the bureaucracy was letting me go.

N. KOREA’S LATEST MISSILE LAUNCH Aimed At Testing Carrying “Large Scale Heavy Nuclear Warhead”,"North Korea said on Monday it had successfully conducted a newly developed mid-to-long range missile test on Sunday, supervised by leader Kim Jong Un and aimed at verifying the capability to carry a  large scale heavy nuclear warhead. Kim accused the United States of  browbeating  countries that  have no nukes  and warned Washington not to misjudge the reality that its mainland is in the North s  sighting range for strike,  the North s official KCNA news agency reported.The North fired a ballistic missile that landed in the sea near Russia on Sunday in a launch that Washington called a message to South Korea, days after its new president took office pledging to engage Pyongyang in dialogue.The missile was launched at the highest angle so as not to affect the security of neighboring countries and flew 787 kilometers (490 miles) reaching an altitude of 2,111.5 kilometers (1,312 miles), KCNA said.Experts said the altitude reached by the missile tested on Sunday meant it was launched at a high trajectory, which would limit the lateral distance it traveled. But if it was fired at a standard trajectory, it would have a range of at least 4,000 km (2,500 miles), experts said. The test-fire aimed at verifying the tactical and technological specifications of the newly developed ballistic rocket capable of carrying a large-size heavy nuclear warhead,  KCNA said. North Korea is believed to be developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and reaching the mainland United States.The U.S. military s Pacific Command said the type of missile that was fired was  not consistent with an intercontinental ballistic missile .The United Nations Security Council is due to meet on Tuesday to discuss North Korea s latest missile launch, diplomats said on Sunday, which was requested by the United States and allies South Korea and Japan.U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called the launch a message by Pyongyang to South Korea after the election of President Moon Jae-in, who took office on Wednesday.The report on the missile s flight was largely consistent with South Korean and Japanese assessments on Sunday that it flew 700 km (435 miles)and reached an altitude of more than 2,000 km (1,243 miles), which is further and higher than an intermediate-range missile tested in February from the same region, northwest of Pyongyang. North Korea s latest successful missile test represents a level of performance never before seen from a North Korean missile,  Washington-based monitoring project, 38 North, said in an analysis issued on Sunday. It appears to have not only demonstrated an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that might enable them to reliably strike the U.S. base at Guam, but more importantly, may represent a substantial advance to developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM),  it said.For entire story  REUTERS",politics,"May 15, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Watch Lil Wayne say the media doesn t want to ask him about racism that he s faced, because  he s blessed  and that  never faced racism in his life :Carter cited as evidence the fact that his concerts were attended by a lot of white fans. I thought that was clearly a message that were was no such thing as racism,  he told host Skip Bayless.The New Orleans-born rapper came under fire on social media for his comments, but explained they had to do with the man who saved his life.Carter was just 12 years old when he accidentally shot himself in the chest.He was lying on the floor when police broke down his door, stepping over his body as they searched for guns and drugs.The cops who ran into the home were  blacker than me , Carter said, but the one cop who stopped to check on him was  white as snow .Carter said the man, who was known as  Uncle Bob , chastised his fellow officers for leaving him.

WHOA! CHUCK TODD’S Combative and Insulting Interview of Sec of State Rex Tillerson Goes Off The Rails [Video],"Chuck Todd exposed his nasty side when he totally abused the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on his show Meet the Press: Of course, Tillerson held his own and gave replies that we full of credibility and support for President Trump: I have a great relationship with the president. I understand what his objectives are. When I m not clear on what his objectives are, we talk about it. I am devoted to helping the president achieve his objectives, helping him be successful. And I understand I have to earn his confidence every day with how I go about those affairs and how I go about conducting the State Department s activities consistent with the direction he wants to take the country. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Pres. Trump:  I have to earn his confidence every day.  Watch more tomorrow on #MTP pic.twitter.com/PZnrqCZpAh  Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) May 13, 2017FULL INTERVIEW:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lznEK71d9z4FULL TRANSCRIPT OF THE INTERVIEW: CHUCK TODD:When President Trump fired James Comey, a lot of Democrats jumped to the collection that the president was trying to stymie the investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. And on Thursday, the president told NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt that he was thinking of, quote,  This Russia thing,  when he made his decision. Yesterday, I sat down with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and I began by asking him whether he agrees with the president that the Russia story is fake news and a witch hunt.SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, Chuck, the president I think has made it clear that he feels it s important that we reengage with Russia. The relationship with Russia, as he has described, and I have described as well, is I think at an all-time low point since the end of the Cold War, with a very low level of trust.I think the world, and it s in the interest of the American people, it s in the interest of Russia, the rest of the world, that we do something to see if we cannot improve the relationship between the two greatest nuclear powers in the world. So the president, I think, is committed to at least make an effort in that regard, and he has certainly asked me to make an important effort as well.CHUCK TODD:I understand that, but you look at what s happened in these Western European nations, in France and the U.K., in Germany, Italy. Accusations of Russian interference in their democratic process. What message does it send to those countries that their number one ally, the United States, the president fired the man at the agency that was looking into the very problem they re dealing with, Russian interference in the democracy?SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, Chuck, what I hear from the leaders of the other nations, Europe and more broadly, and the subject of Russia comes up in all of our conversations, is all the other nations want the U.S. and Russia to work towards improving our relationship as well, for all the reasons that I just mentioned.I think it s largely viewed that it is not healthy for the world. It s certainly not healthy for us, for the American people, our national security interest and otherwise, for this relationship to remain at this low level. Whether we can improve it or not remains to be seen.It s going to take some time. It s going to take a lot of hard work. But I think the president s committed, rightly so, and I m committed with him as well, to see if we cannot do something to put us on a better footing in our relationship with Russia.CHUCK TODD:Can you get on a better footing with them if you don t address this issue of the Russian interference? I mean your counterpart, the Russian foreign minister, Mr. Lavrov, said that you guys didn t even talk about this issue of Russian interference in our election because, as he put it, President Trump himself says it s fake news, so it s not an issue. Why haven t you brought it up with them?SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, Chuck, I think we have such a broad range of important issues that have to be addressed in the U.S.-Russia relationship. Obviously the interference in the election is one of those. I think it s been well documented, it s pretty well understood, the nature of that interference, here and elsewhere.And you know, these are not new tactics on the part of the Russian government, directed not only at us but at others. But again, I think we have to look at this relationship in its broadest contours, and there are many, many important areas which require our attention if we are to bring it back to a relationship that we believe is necessary for the security of the U.S.CHUCK TODD:Mr. Secretary, though. This is fundamental. They interfered with our democracy. I just don t understand how this is not a top issue for you to deal with with them in order to, essentially, start with a clean slate. Can t start with a clean slate until maybe they either own up to what they did, or we punish them in a way that they re not going to do this again.SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, Chuck, I think it s important to understand we re not trying to start with a clean slate. I think terms like having a reset are overused. You cannot reset. You cannot erase the past. You cannot start with a clean slate. And we re not trying to start with a clean slate.We re starting with the slate we have. And all the problems that are on that slate. We don t dismiss any of them. We don t give anyone a free pass on any of them. They re part of the entire nature of the discussion we re having with the Russians. And yes, there are a large number of issues that we have to get around to addressing in order to put this relationship back together, if that is indeed possible.CHUCK TODD:During your confirmation hearings you made clear you didn t have  obviously you hadn t been briefed on the intelligence reports, the 17 different agencies that came to the conclusions that the Russians did make an effort to interfere in this election. Obviously there s an investigation going along to see if there was any collusion in this interference. Since you ve become Secretary of State in February, have you been briefed? Have you seen this intelligence now? Is it clear in your mind that it is a fact the Russians interfered in our elections?SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:I have seen the intelligence reports, Chuck, and yes, I don t think there s any question that the Russians were playing around in our electoral processes. Again, as those intelligence reports also have indicated, it s inconclusive as to what, if any, effect it had.CHUCK TODD:I understand about the impact, but the fact that they got into it, what should the repercussions be now, in your mind?SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, they re just part of that broader landscape of conversations, Chuck. And I think, you know, the real impact is it serves yet again to undermine the trust between the United States and Russia. And as I have said, and the president has said, you know, we re just at a very, very low level of trust between our two countries right now. And so what we re exploring is how do we begin the process of restoring that trust. And ultimately it will touch on all of these issues.CHUCK TODD:I want to give you a chance to respond to an op-ed that Senator John McCain wrote, where he invoked your name, sir. He said this.  In a recent address to State Department employees Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said,  Conditioning our foreign policy too heavily on values creates obstacles to advance our national interests.' McCain goes on to write,  With those words, Secretary Tillerson sent a message to oppressed people everywhere,  Don t look to the United States for hope. Our values make us sympathetic to your plight, and when it s convenient we might officially express that sympathy.'  Some pretty tough words from Senator McCain. What do you say in response?SECRETARY REX TILLERSON:Well, first, I d say if anyone has earned the right to express their views, Senator McCain has. And I have great respect for the senator. I think the point that I was making, Chuck, in that message to State Department employees is an important one to understand.And that s that America s values of freedom, of treatment of people, human dignity, freedom of expression throughout the world, those are our values. Those are enduring values. They are part of everything we do. And in fact they serve as the guidepost and they serve as the boundaries as we develop our foreign policy approaches and our diplomatic efforts.But I make a distinction between values and policy. A policy has to be tailored to the individual situation. To the country. To its circumstances. To the broader issues that we are addressing in terms of advancing our national security interest, our national economic interest.And so policies have to be adaptable. They have to change. They have to adjust to conditions. But our values can never change. Our values can never be put in a position of having to be compromised. And so the values guide our policy, but if we put our values in the front of our policies and say,  This is our policy,  we have no room to adapt to changing circumstances to achieve our ultimate objective. And I think if we are successful in achieving our ultimate diplomatic and national security objectives, we will create the conditions for the advancement of freedom in countries all over the world.CHUCK TODD:Secretary Tillerson, I know you re busy and you ve got to get going. You ve got this big trip ahead of you. Thank you for spending some time with us. I appreciate it.",politics,"May 14, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
MSNBC ANCHOR: Anti-Sanctuary City Law “Sounds Almost Like An Apartheid-Era Law” [Video],"Joy Reid is unbelievable when she claims the Texas anti-sanctuary city law  Sounds Almost Like an Apartheid-era Law So now enforcing the law is just like South African apartheid???The ACLU lawyer even agrees with Reid about the law These lefty political hacks are undermining the rule of law in America:ABBOTT SIGNS BILL ON SANCTUARY CITIES: Texas Governor Abbott just signed a ban on so-called  sanctuary cities COMMON SENSE IS BACK!Chances of this not being challenged in court are slim. It s pretty sad when your governor can t even enforce laws already on the books. Pitiful!Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday signed a law targeting so-called  sanctuary cities  that allows police to ask about a person s immigration status and threatens sheriffs with jail if they don t cooperate with federal authorities.He signed the bill on Facebook today:Governor Abbott stated before signing the bill:  Let s be clear about something. We all support legal immigration. It helped to build America and Texas. Legal immigration is different from harboring people who have committed dangerous crimes. This law cracks down on policies like the Travis County sheriff who declared she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes. Those policies are sanctuary city policies and won t be tolerated in Texas. Abbott, a Republican in his first term, took the unusual step of signing the bill on Facebook with no advanced public notice. He said Texas residents expect lawmakers to  keep us safe  and said similar laws have already been tested in federal court, where opponents have already been hinting the bill will be immediately challenged. Texas has now banned sanctuary cities in the Lone Star State,  Abbott said.We couldn t be happier about this!The bill cleared a final hurdle this week in the Republican-controlled Legislature over objections from Democrats and immigrant rights supporters who ve packed the Texas Capitol. They call it a  show-me-your-papers  measure that will be used to discriminate against Latinos.Every major police chief in Texas opposed the bill. Republicans say it is needed to ensure local jails honor requests from federal officials to keep dangerous offenders behind bars.The Texas bill allows police to inquire about the immigration status of anyone they detain, a situation that can range from arrest for a crime to being stopped for a traffic violation.This is HUGE!Attorney General Jeff Sessions also put sanctuary cities on notice.

REPORT: PRESIDENT TRUMP To Replace Sean Spicer With FOX News Personality,"It s no secret that President Trump is very much a hands-on type of manager. Should anyone really be surprised by the firing and hiring of people in his inner-circle, as he assesses their job performances, to ensure the most qualified people are in place for key positions of his administration? The next couple of weeks should be interesting as Trump figures out which direction he ll go with press briefings, and who, if anyone, will represent him as a trusted and competent spokesperson. The inside scoop from Infowars, is that he s already made that decision White House sources have told Infowars that Sean Spicer could be fired within the next week as President Trump begins a purge of establishment advisers who he feels have failed to properly investigate leaks coming from within the administration.Speculation is already swirling as to whether or not Spicer will return after he was  benched  and temporarily replaced with Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Spicer has behaved like a  deer in the headlights  in recent weeks and is not able to handle the pressure of the job, according to one source.They add that Spicer will be gone by next week and that former prosecutor and current Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who was previously considered for the role, is currently the favorite to replace him.   InfowarsBack in October, she was seen entering Trump Tower and rumors began swirling she was up for a position on the communications team. By December, the speculation hit its fever pitch and political observers were sure Guilfoyle would be involved with the operation somehow, whether as press secretary or in an ancillary role. Even some of her Fox News colleagues spoke out in favor of her heading to the White House.Still, a New York Times report yesterday said,  while Mr. Trump has raised the Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle to allies as a possible press secretary, he has spent several hours with Mr. Spicer this week, praising his television  ratings  during the briefings. Though Trump has been claiming he wants to stop the briefings, his actions indicate otherwise. Who knows, but maybe we ll see Guilfoyle at that podium sooner than we think. The only question left then would be who will play her on Saturday Night Live?A report from the AP out today also notes that  Trump is mulling expanding the communications team and has eyed hiring producers from Fox News.  -Mediaite",politics,"May 14, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

This past week was a banner week of lies from the main stream media so it s our pleasure to straighten things out for everyone We ve discovered a star news reporting organization that stands above most others in their reporting on the Trump/Russia investigation. CIRCA NEWS with Sara Carter and John Solomon are setting the record straight!Here s the skinny on the latest media lies and the truth via Circa:Aggressive news reporting can be a public service, like when courageous journalists exposed Richard Nixon s Watergate, the Catholic church s cover up of the sexual abuse and the U.S. intelligence failures that preceded 9-11.But breathless, half-baked reporting in times of tumult can also misserve the public, like when The Wall Street Journal retracted a false story that Bill Clinton had been seen in a compromising position with an intern in the White House or when NBC wrongly identified Richard Jewell as the Olympic Park bombing suspect.This past week, professional journalism offered us several new examples of breathless reporting during the brouhaha over Donald Trump, James Comey and Russia intelligence. At their least, some stories misled the public, and at their worst they outright misinformed.Here are some examples this week that should cause the media to search whether its current standards are doing enough to ensure the public gets the whole truth. You can review the facts and decide for yourself whether the media shamed itself.The Rosenstein  Quitting Episode The Washington Post reported Wednesday night that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had  threatened to resign after the narrative emerging from the White House on Tuesday evening cast him as a prime mover of the decision to fire Comey. The story cited an unnamed source close to the White House. But it did not have any comment or confirmation from the man who was alleged to have made the threat.When Sinclair Broadcast Group s Michelle Macaluso finally caught up to Rosenstein, a funny thing happened. He debunked the story. No, I m not quitting,  he said.The reporter pressed on:  Did you threaten to quit? No,  Rosenstein said.The Post did not return a call for comment Friday on whether it stood by its story.The Comey resources requestThe New York Times and several other outlets reported Wednesday that Comey, just before he was fired, had asked the Justice Department s Rosenstein for more funding and personnel for the Russia intelligence probe. But when Comey s deputy got to Capitol Hill the next day, he denied there was any need for more resources. I believe we have the adequate resources to do it and I know that we have resourced that investigation adequately,  FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe told lawmakers.McCabe said the FBI, if it needed more resources, wouldn t even go to the Justice Department but instead to Congress.  We don t typically request resources for an individual case,  he explained.CNN s claim that Trump  is under investigation During the breaking story on Comey Tuesday night, respected CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin declared the FBI director s firing was a  grotesque abuse of power  and that it was a  political act when the President is under investigation. Toobin is entitled to his opinion but he should have the right facts. Numerous sources confirm to Circa that Comey told Congress just last week that Trump is NOT a target of the Russia probe.CNN s connection of grand jury subpoenas to Comey s firingCNN went live with an exclusive the night Comey was fired, reporting that grand jury subpoenas were issued to associates of former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn seeking business records in the Russia case.But with one slight turn of hand, CNN s legitimate scoop was crafted to suggest there had been some correlation to Comey s firing. CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey,  the network reported.The multitude of media comparisons to WatergateCountless media outlets from Politico and The New York Times to Mother Jones have suggested the whole Russia scandal is akin to Watergate, right down to Comey s firing mirroring Nixon s efforts to axe the special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.There s just one problem with that. Nixon was the target of the Watergate probe and he was accused of specific crimes.Via: Circa New/John Solomon",politics,"May 13, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
“SHE’S NO PUSHOVER”: How Sarah Huckabee Sanders Made It To The White House Podium,"Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders found herself behind the briefing room lectern last Wednesday fielding questions about the firing of FBI Director James Comey and the investigation into Russia s involvement in the 2016 campaign.Her calm, cool and collected approach to rapid-fire questioning stood in stark contrast to that of Sean Spicer s  brash mannerisms.But Sanders isn t a soft pushover, and she can hold her own   as evidenced by her approach to Thursday s briefing. Sanders often sighed and lamented that she had to repeat herself, answering reporters  questions regarding Comey s firing with,  I think I ve already answered this. Sanders  approach to handling the press is due to years of political upbringing, her father told Fox News in an interview. And for those who might not recognize her face, Sanders  maiden name, Huckabee, is a dead giveaway for just what kind of political upbringing that was.Family MattersThe daughter of former two-time Republican presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sanders grew up in politics in a way that many kids don t, Huckabee said. I always say that when most kids are 7 or 8 years old out jumping rope, she was sitting at the kitchen table listening to [political commentators] analyze poll results,  he said.Sanders was consistently ingrained in her father s own political aspirations, serving as his field director for his 2002 gubernatorial reelection campaign and national political director during his 2008 presidential bid. In 2016, she ran his presidential campaign.But it was growing up in the Arkansas governor s mansion as a young teenager that prepared Sanders for her current role as deputy press secretary, Huckabee said.Huckabee became governor in the summer of 1996 as the then-Democratic Gov. Jim Guy Tucker was convicted of fraud. Huckabee describes the transition and the media during that time as  hostile  and  brutal  as the legislature was the  most lopsided in the country    worse than that of Massachusetts or Maine, he said. At the time, Huckabee said, Sanders was in junior high school. [Sanders] saw how utterly unfair and petty the press can be for even simple things,  Huckabee said.  So having grown up with that, I think people don t understand   it s not just that she presents a sort of sense of being beyond it; she really is. She s seen it her whole life. But Huckabee also credits his daughter s poise behind the briefing room podium to another familial matter   growing up with two older brothers. She grew up pretty doggone tough. She had to, as a matter of survival,  Huckabee said.  She s got a very sweet heart, but she s tough, and she can handle herself. She s had to take all kinds of gruff from her brothers, so she s pretty fearless. Huckabee added that as his youngest child   and his only daughter at that   Sanders was at time spoiled by her parents. But even still, the Huckabees sought to instill a spirit of hard work in all the children, he said. She s always been raised to tell the truth, take responsibility for her own actions, to work hard for what she wants in life. Even as teenagers, when they went to things like church camp, we wouldn t pay their tuition,  he said.  We told them that they needed to work in the cafeteria or snack bar to cover their costs   not because it was absolutely necessary, but because we wanted them to understand and appreciate that everything costs something. Road to the White HouseHuckabee describes his daughter as the type who was always ambitious. Like him, Sanders attended Ouachita Baptist University, a private liberal arts school in southwest Arkansas where she was student body president.Following college, Sanders took a job at the Department of Education under the Bush administration, according to a 2007 profile in Time. She s always been raised to tell the truth, take responsibility for her own actions, to work hard for what she wants in life.  Sanders  resume includes a bevy of GOP campaigns: working on former President George W. Bush s reelection campaign in 2004, acting as a senior advisor to Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton s Senate bid and managing other Arkansas Sen. John Boozman s bid for Senate.Outside of campaigning, Sanders worked as a national campaign manager for Bono s ONE Campaign, the grassroots advocacy organization aimed at ending poverty.She also cofounded the political consulting firm in Little Rock, Second Street Strategies, which her husband is also involved with.In 2010, Sanders was named to Time s 40 Under 40 list along with longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, civil rights leader Ben Jealous and Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich.But it was after Huckabee s withdrawal from the Republican-heavy field of presidential candidates in February 2016 when Sanders was tapped by the Trump campaign as a senior advisor and eventual on-air surrogate. I volunteered to join Mr. Trump s campaign because he is a champion of working families, not Washington-Wall Street elites,  Sanders said in a statement released by the campaign at the time.Her statement added praise for Trump s anti-abortion and  pro-marriage  stance.Next StepsAs Sanders has gained more notoriety in the Trump administration   often appearing on camera to defend the president s actions and agenda   rumors circulated among journalists and White House aides about her future in the Trump administration.Her time behind the podium this week in Spicer s absence could be an audition for his job, anonymous White House aides reportedly told Politico. We re all under the impression that Sanders is auditioning for a greater role in the Trump administration and don t rule out Spicer s job,  a White House aide told Fox News in response to the Politico report.But Sanders dismissed the idea as just  another ridiculous story.

BEAUTIFUL! FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP Hosts Military Moms: “Mother Is A Title That Changes Your Life Forever”,"Fist Lady Melania Trump hosted military moms at the White House on Friday. She gave a heartwarming and heartfelt speech about what it means to be a mother. She s beautiful inside and out!Notice how President Trump looks on lovingly and proudly. The First Lady speaks with empathy about how hard it must be for them to send their military son or daughter to fight for America: Thank you for all that you do, for your selflessness and for your own sacrifice on behalf of our country    First Lady Melania TrumpShe does a great job!THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE: In honor of Mother s Day, President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump welcomed active-duty troops, their spouses and mothers to the White House, today. As commander in chief of the United States, my supreme duty is to protect our citizens and that means supporting our servicemen and women,  the president said.  That obligation begins the first day they put on the uniform and continues every day after, when they return to civilian life as veterans. Trump said he would make sure the nation always takes care of its soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and the members of the Coast Guard. To every military service member, mother and spouse here today, I want you to know you have my complete and total support   [and] the White House, this administration and this government stands fully behind you,  the president said.Moms Are Heroes, Too As we celebrate Mother s Day this weekend, this is one of many opportunities for us to thank the incredible military mothers who love and care for our nation s heroes,  Trump said. The mothers are heroes, too. It is your sacrifice that protects our nation, safeguards our liberties and makes sure our beautiful American flag always waves proudly above our very glorious land,  he said to the military mothers in the audience.The president introduced First Lady Melania Trump, who said she was honored by the military members  presence as the nation celebrates National Military Appreciation Month and Mother s Day.Title That Claims The Heart As everyone in this room knows, mother is a title that claims your heart and changes your life forever,  the first lady said.  In fact, it has been said that having a child means allowing your heart to walk around outside of your body. For the mothers of someone who has, or is, serving our country, this must be especially true. Noting that while she, too, is a mother, Melania Trump said she does not know of the many different challenges that come with being the parent of a service member.Part Of A Community While you stand with many other parents, so strong and so proud, I am sure that you sometimes march on this journey alone,  the first lady said, adding,  While your sons and daughters are away serving so selflessly, having a community share even some of that burden must make all the difference in the world. Melania Trump told the mothers in the audience they are part of a community, and the White House is proud to be a part of it with them. Thank you for all that you do, for your selflessness and for your own sacrifice on behalf of our country,  she said. Let today s celebration with this community of strong and selfless moms be a first step in building relationships,  the first lady said,  and in your knowing, that my husband and I, along with   everyone here at the White House, hold you close in our hearts and thoughts each and every day.

“DEAL WITH FACTS!”: Tom Brokaw Calls Out Political Hack Andrea Mitchell On Her Comey Narrative [Video],"Veteran newscaster Tom Brokaw called out political hack Andrea Mitchell on her ridiculous Comey narrative. He said,  deal with facts  in to Mitchell in an effort to snap her back into reality. Her judgement is so clouded by her hate for all things Trump that she can t see that Comey needed to be fired ASAP. Brokaw even said he didn t know anyone who thought Comey was doing a good job! Brokaw is a left-leaning journalist so his judgement isn t clouded with a pro-Trump agenda:Tom Brokaw:  One of the things that I learned during Watergate is that we dealt with it every day on a factual basis. There was not a lot of speculation. Now, of course, the media landscape has changed a lot, and we have that going on 24/7. I do think, however, that all of us as reporters have to take a deep breath and say let s deal with the facts as we know them at this point. Our obligation I think is to sort it out, truth from fact, and deal with the truth. Amen! Thank you Mr. Brokaw!",politics,"May 13, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

POST-OBAMA AMERICA: Liberal Thug Gets Physical With N. Dakota GOP Rep At Town Hall [VIDEO],"It s becoming fairly commonplace for public acts of violence to occur when liberals don t get exactly what they want. We used to rely on free speech at town halls to debate our differences, but we re living in a post-Obama era now, where Soros paid thugs have been committing so many acts of violence occur that we almost expect it. Sadly, wherever there is a gathering of people with opposing political views, most Americans now expect to see violence take place A man got physical with Republican North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer at a town hall meeting Thursday before being escorted out by police.The man was yelling at Rep. Cramer,  Will the rich benefit from, if the health care is destroyed, do the rich get a tax break? Yes or no?  He then shoved cash into the congressman s collar, saying,  There you go, take it. Cramer responded,  That s too far,  and police escorted the man from the meeting. Another man was escorted out after he stepped in and blocked the man yelling as he was angrily approaching the congressman.CNN anchor Poppy Harlow described the scene as,  This man showing his disgust with the Congressman s support of tax cuts for the wealthy, one part of the GOP plan right now.

WOW! RUSSIAN HACKER Gives Stunning Details Of Deal FBI Offered Him To Falsely Claim He Hacked Hillary’s Email On Behalf Of Putin For Trump,"A Russian man wanted by the Justice Department on charges connected to hacking U.S. companies now claims the FBIoffered him immunity in exchange for accepting responsibility for cyberattacks targeting former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Yevgeny Nikulin, the alleged hacker, laid the claim to Russian media Thursday in a letter sent from a Czech Republic prison cell amid an international extradition battle currently underway between Washington and Moscow.FBI agents promised Mr. Nikulin money, American citizenship and a free apartment for taking the fall over hacking Mrs. Clinton s campaign, he alleged in a letter published Thursday by Nastoyashchoe Vremya, a Russian-language website. He was offered to falsely testify that he was cooperating in the attack on the Democratic Party,  defense attorney Martin Sadilek said Thursday, the Associated Press reported.The FBI declined to comment.Mr. Nikulin was apprehended in Prague last October pursuant to an internal arrest warrant and was subsequently charged by a federal grand jury in California with hacking LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring, three San Francisco-based internet companies. He s wanted in both the U.S. and Russia, however, and has remained for months in Czech custody as authorities review requests from both countries.FBI agents interviewed Mr. Nikulin twice since his arrest, he wrote, and each time asked him to confess to hacking American political targets. Mr. Nikulin said he refused their initial request last November, then received a second offer three months later.FBI agents asked Mr. Nikulin to admit hacking Mrs. Clinton s presidential campaign, Democratic Party computers and American polling stations  on Putin s orders,  he wrote. In exchange, he alleges, the FBI said he d be extradited to the U.S. but ultimately given money, citizenship and a free apartment.

James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  the president tweeted.James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017It s unclear whether Trump was warning that the White House is recording his calls, or if he believes the FBI may have been recording Comey s.Trump said Thursday during an interview with NBC News that the two men have spoken at least three times since Inauguration Day.Watch President Trump tell NBC s Lester Holt he was going to fire Comey anyway:And on those occasions, he insisted, Comey assured him that he was not personally the subject of any federal investigations. He said it once at dinner and then he said it twice during phone calls,  Trump said.He described a matter-of-fact exchange over dinner in which he asked an unusual question and got an unconventional response. I said,  If it s possible would you let me know, am I under investigation?  Trump recalled. He said,  You are not under investigation . It is rare for a federal law enforcement official to tell anyone, including the President of the United States, whether they are being investigated.Even if Comey doesn t speak to reporters about the circumstances behind his dismissal on Tuesday, he may have a high-profile venue to tell his side of the story.The Senate Intelligence Committee has asked him to testify next week.The latest twist from Trump amid reports that he demanded loyalty from James Comey during the private dinner at the White House back in January.The claims from associates of the now fired FBI director. Comey had told associates that he was summoned to the White House for a one-on-one dinner with Trump seven days after the inauguration, the New York Times reports.It was during the dinner that Trump reportedly asked Comey twice to pledge loyalty to him as the new Commander in Chief.Sources claim Comey declined to do so but said he told the President he would always be honest with him.Trump is said to have pressed Comey on whether that would be  honest loyalty , to which the FBI director said:  You will have that.  Sources close to Comey said he now believes this dinner conversation may have sealed his fate.This version of events is vastly different to the dinner conversation Trump himself described in an interview with NBC s Lester Holt on Thursday.The version is denied by the White House. But the president also used Twitter on Friday morning to say that  it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy .While it is not clear if they are talking about the same dinner, the pair are believed to have only dined together privately once.Trump indicated that he had dinner with Comey at the former FBI director s request   and said Comey was angling to keep his job. I had a dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. We had a very nice dinner at the White House,  Trump said. He asked for the dinner?  Holt followed up. A dinner was arranged, I think he asked for the dinner,  the president hedged.  And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head. And I said I ll consider and we ll see what happens. But we had a very nice dinner. And at that time he told me  you are not under investigation ,  Trump said.Trump said he had asked Comey   once over dinner and twice by phone   if the FBI were investigating him as part of its probe into alleged collusion between members of his campaign and the Russian government prior to the election.The President showed no concern that the request might be viewed as interference in the active FBI probe.Comey has not spoken publicly to confirm or challenge Trump s account.During that same interview, Trump declared he had planned to fire Comey all along, regardless of whether top Justice Department officials recommended the stunning step.The White House had initially cited a Justice Department memo criticizing Comey s handling of last year s investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails as the impetus for Trump s decision.For entire story-Daily Mail",politics,"May 12, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

WOW! MALE College Professor Caught On Camera BULLYING Female Pro-Life Student: “College campuses are not free speech areas” [VIDEO],"A Fresno State University professor was recently caught on camera scrubbing pro-life message off of the sidewalk and encouraging several of his students to do the same.Here is Gregory Thatcher s profile on the Fresno State College website. We thought we d post it before they take it down. His contact information is listed below, if you d like to have a respectful free speech discussion with him. The whole idea of free speech is that we have a free speech area on campus, kay?  Professor Gregory Thatcher erroneously declares in a video recorded by the school s Students for Life chapter.  Free speech is free speech in the free speech area. It s a pretty simple concept, okay? This does not constitute a free speech area, okay? He and his  students  go on to argue that it is within their own First Amendment rights to actively remove the pro-life messages from campus, and in one instance Thatcher claims that since the pro-life group has  permission to put it down  he has  permission to get rid of it. This is our part of free speech. Do you disagree with our part of free speech?  Thatcher asked while erasing one of the club s messages, after which he proclaimed that  college campuses are not free speech areas. The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) has since filed a lawsuit against Thatcher on behalf of the Students for Life chapter at Fresno State, arguing that his efforts to intimidate and harass members of the Student for Life chapter violated their fundamental right to free speech.***WARNING***The video you are about to see will make your blood boil. It s pretty hard to watch a full grown man employed by Fresno College sending female students out to do his dirty work. It s even harder to watch the way he aggressively approaches this young female pro-life student, while arrogantly explaining to her that he has the right to deny her free-speech in America Fresno State Students for Life received full permission to chalk pro-life messages near the library. Rather than countering with his own message, Dr. Thatcher took the illegal approach of censoring speech and inciting students to help in this,  Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, remarked in a press release, claiming that no student  should have to endure this kind of intimidation and harassment for simply expressing their views.

FURIOUS FBI Agents Speak Out On Clinton Email Case: “We didn’t search their house. We always search the house.”,"FBI Agents are coming forward now to voice their frustrations and concerns about FBI Director James Comey s inept policing of the FBI. Specifically, the Clinton email investigation was held up by Comey standing in the way. One of the specifics of the investigation that hindered it was that the Clinton house was never searched. The FBI always does a search of a household in an investigation. The New York FBI agents working the case were livid at the stonewalling in the Clinton case. FBI agents are now lawyering up and speaking up to tell what they know This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have convened but was not. That is appalling,  an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision.  We talk about it in the office and don t know how Comey can keep going. DID ANYONE ELSE THINK THIS EXACT SAME THING:The agent was also surprised that the bureau did not bother to search Clinton s house during the investigation. We didn t search their house. We always search the house. The search should not just have been for private electronics, which contained classified material, but even for printouts of such material,  he said. There should have been a complete search of their residence,  the agent pointed out.  That the FBI did not seize devices is unbelievable. The FBI even seizes devices that have been set on fire. Another special agent for the bureau that worked counter-terrorism and criminal cases said he is offended by Comey s saying:  we  and  I ve been an investigator. The idea that the Clinton/e-mail case didn t go to a grand jury is ridiculous. According to Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova, more FBI agents will be talking about the problems at bureau and specifically the handling of the Clinton case by Comey when Congress comes back into session and decides to force them to testify by subpoena. People are starting to talk. They re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked to day to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away. The most important thing of all is that the agents have decided that they are going to talk.

"WATCH: PRESIDENT TRUMP Hilariously Exposes Hypocrisy Of Democrats, Media Allies On Comey Firing In One PERFECT Video","Before Trump, Democrats and their allies in the leftist media rarely had to worry about being called out for their hypocrisy. First of all, there wasn t an opposing voice in the media and politicians in the Republican Party, most especially the President of the United States, certainly weren t going to call them out. Before Donald J. Trump, Republicans were under the false impression that they needed the press in their corner. That was before Donald J. Trump shattered the old rules that protected the media class from scrutiny and allowed them to fully control the narrative.Fortunately for every American, there s a new sheriff in town, who is hell-bent on holding Democrats and the leftist media s feet to the fire when it comes to their hypocrisy.

LOL! CNN Interview Abruptly Ends When Student Who Started Protest At Betsy DeVos Speech Realizes He Can’t Explain Why He’s Protesting [VIDEO],"The students of the historically black Bethune-Cookman University booed the invited commencement speaker, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. They yelled over her speech, they even turned their backs on her. For 25 minutes the students at Bethune Cookman reminded us just how far Obama has divided our nation.A sophomore student at Bethune-Cookman, a historically black university, filmed himself running around with his phone as he yelled for the seniors to stand and rebuke Betsy DeVos during her commencement speech. He implored the graduating seniors to disrupt her speech by yelling and standing with their backs to  DeVos, who bravely persevered through her speech in spite of their embarrassing behavior.The student, who says his name is  Bobbie Luke  and identifies himself as a  StuPid NiGGA  on his Twitter account, was eventually thrown out of the venue by campus security.CNN breathlessly followed the student as he was being thrown out, hoping to get an intelligent response from the student about why he was whipping the graduating seniors into a frenzy over Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos  commencement speech. What they got however, was a big disappointment.Here s the video that was taken by @bobbieluke on his cell phone of the graduating seniors responding to his pleas to disrupt and disrespect their commencement speaker:BCU17.

When asked by the CNN reporter what he was standing up for, Luke replied:  I don t like what she said and nothing at the end of the day is going to change my opinion. Basically, if you not, if you not, basically if you let money devalue your morals, I m not trying to hear. That s all I got to say. As Bobbie Luke is walking away, he can be heard saying, I like your suit.  (Bobbie Luke essentially ends the interview  by saying he likes the CNN reporter s nice [expensive?] suit that was purchased with money, that according to Luke, devalues morals LOL!)One demonstrator escorted out of @BetsyDeVos speech. pic.twitter.com/VmssgmakMR  Nick Valencia (@CNNValencia) May 10, 2017Liberal hack Matt Lauer, host of the Today Show did a story on the disrespectful behavior of the graduates. As usual, Lauer couldn t help himself from attempting to make it look like DeVos was the villain in the story. Listen to the emphasis Lauer places on words and phrases like  controversial  educational secretary. He goes on to say DeVos was  booed , and she  upset  students, and  some  of the graduates students turned the backs on her, and  she  upset the students. Every word this liberal hack, who s posing as a benign host on the Today Show utters is planned in advance of his segments.

"CLASS ACT: Watch Betsy DeVos Respond While Students At Black College Yell, Heckle, Turn Backs On Her During Commencement Speech [VIDEO]","Betsy DeVos just proved to America why President Trump chose her among so many qualified candidates to reform our broken education system. Full-grown men would have crumbled under the kind of pressure and hate she was facing during her graceful commencement speech. Let s face it, most of us would have walked off the stage, but Betsy DeVos, firm in her resolution to deliver the speech she was invited to share, stood at the podium, and against all odds, addressed an angry group of students railing against  the injustice  at a college where 95% of the students receive some form of state or federal grant money.During the roughly 25-minute speech, DeVos took time to address the criticism that s come her way since she was unveiled as the university s graduation speaker, telling the crowd it was important to converse with and learn from people despite disagreements.The natural instinct is to join in the chorus of conflict, to make your voice louder, your point bigger and your position stronger,  DeVos said.  But we will not solve the significant and real problems our country faces if we cannot bring ourselves to embrace a mindset of grace. We must first listen, then speak   with humility   to genuinely hear the perspectives of those with whom we don t immediately or instinctively agree,  she continued.While DeVos spoke, the students continued to heckle and yell over DeVos as she persevered through her speech. The University president who was clearly embarrassed by the behavior of the graduates finally stepped up to the microphone to address the students in hopes of getting the disrespectful group under control telling them,  If this behavior continues, your degrees will be mailed to you. Choose which way you wanna go.  He then implored the students to be seated.The students chose to continue with their embarrassing behavior, at which time DeVos began to once again address the crowd:Many Bethune-Cookman University students, alumni and supporters made their disapproval of DeVos  appearance known well before she took the stage.On Tuesday, Bethune-Cookman University students and alumni delivered thousands of signatures to the school s president, Edison O. Jackson, and the university s Board of Trustees in a last-ditch effort to try and change their minds about inviting DeVos to speak.DeVos, a West Michigan native, initially drew ire from students and supporters from historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, throughout the country after she connected HBCUs to the school choice movement in February. MLiveDeVos recently met with presidents and chancellors of historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, at the White House. Following that meeting, she said in a statement that a key priority for the administration was to help develop opportunities for underserved communities, and praised HBCUs for fulfilling that mission all along. They started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education,  she said in the statement.  They saw that the system wasn t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. DeVos continued:  HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Critics were quick to point out on social media that HBCUs were initially founded in part because black students often did not have the option to enroll in existing public institutions in the South.Others noted public HBCUs were generally not offered the same amount of funding and resources predominantly white colleges and universities received.In an interview with The Chronicle of Higher Education about the controversy, Dillard University President Walter Kimbrough said similar comments she made in the listening session  didn t come across as ill-spirited,  but was a poor analogy. I think she was honestly trying to find a way to connect her experience with HBCUs,  he told The Chronicle of Higher Education.

FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL On Why Comey Was Fired: “You never do that.”," Those of us in the swamp knew who the alligators were in the swamp    former Justice Department official Victoria ToensingVictoria Toensing and her husband Joe diGenova are two well respected lawyers in DC. Because of their closeness to the intel community, Toensing has the inside scoop and held nothing back during an interview about whether Comey should have been fired:While the media and politicians from both parties look for deeper reasons for President Trump s firing of FBI Director James B. Comey, a former Justice Department official says the decision was long overdue and needed for obvious reasons. It just came too late, 109 days too late. Those of us in the swamp knew who the alligators were in the swamp and we all tried to warn the White House, and they didn t listen to us,  said Toensing, who also served as a federal prosecutor.And why did they implore President Trump to fire him? Comey was a narcissist,  she said.  It was all about Comey, and he delighted in wanting to bring down powerful people if they were Republicans. On Tuesday, the Trump administration released its rationale for the Comey firing, focusing on his public announcement that no charges should be filed against Hillary Clinton in the wake of the FBI probe into her use of a private, unsecured server through which she sent and received classified information while she served as secretary of state.Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein accused Comey of usurping the authority of the attorney general in making such a pronouncement and for exposing Clinton s misdeeds when he was effectively closing the investigation.But Toensing said Comey made far more mistakes, starting with his repeated misstating of the statute in question. Comey insisted that intent to break the law was required to bring charges, while gross negligence is the standard laid out in federal law. She also savaged Comey for refusing to impanel a grand jury to probe Clinton and for allowing the same attorney to represent multiple witnesses in the case. That s called a conflict of interest, because that lawyer can get all of her clients together and they can all read from the same music,  she explained.  You never do that. Toensing is also dismissing the intense reaction from Democrats, who she said are now appalled after calling for Comey s head for months. She said the idea that Trump fired Comey because of the ongoing Russia investigation is ridiculous, and so are any comparisons to Richard Nixon s  Saturday Night Massacre. In Watergate, there was a crime. There was a burglary. There was a break-in. What s the crime here? What s the crime? Do we have a crime? No, there s no crime,  said Toensing, noting that Russian involvement in U.S. elections is nothing new.

Watch my lips, no,  Putin said.The Russian strongman made the claim when asked point-blank whether Russia had interfered and whether any evidence to the contrary would get found.He invoked former President Reagan, although the  Read my lips  quote was actually used by his successor, George H.W. Bush, speaking at a CNBC event on Arctic issues.Putin said claims of Russian interference were  lies  used for  domestic American politics.All those things are fictional, illusory and provocations, lies,  Putin continued. All these are used for domestic American political agendas. The anti-Russian card is played by different political forces inside the United States to trade on that and consolidate their positions inside. Then he delivered a friendly message to U.S. audiences.  We said on numerous occasions and I reiterate that we are confident   And know for sure that opinion polls in the Unites States show that very many people are   friendly towards the Russian Federation and I d like to tell these people that we perceive and regard the United States as a great power with which we want to establish good partnership relations. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday in an interview with CBS News,  We all knew Russia was trying to meddle with our election. And we already know right now they re trying to do it with other countries. Ryan continued:  The world s super power, the American government needs to do everything we possibly can, not only to undercut what they re trying to do but to uncover what they re trying to do and help our allies prevent it from happening.

COMEY RESPONDS TO FIRING…What He Said Will Make Liberal Heads Explode,"Since the moment word got out about the firing of FBI Director James Comey, Democrats and their allies in the leftist media have been falling all over themselves to spew their hatred towards Trump and his unfair firing of James Comey. Even though for months, Democrats and the leftist media have been outraged at Comey for the reopening of the FBI investigation into Hillary s e-mails just prior to the election, all is forgiven now. It s time for the media and the Democrats to come together, regroup and focus on the real target President Trump.But now, FBI Director James Comey has made a statement about the firing, and it s not exactly what the media was hoping for. Comey took the high road when he sent a letter on Wednesday to agents and friends regarding President Trump s firing of him the day before. I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all,  he wrote, according to CNN.  I m not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed,  Comey added. I hope you won t either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.  -The HillWatch MSNBC s  Morning Joe  hacks Mika Brzezinski and fake conservative Joe Scarborough attempt to trash Trump s reasoning for firing Comey.

MEDIA IGNORES Time That Bill Clinton FIRED His FBI Director On Day Before Vince Foster Was Found Dead,"In its 109-year history, only one F.B.I. director had been fired   until Tuesday, when President Trump fired James B. Comey. In July 1993, President Bill Clinton fired William S. Sessions, who had been nominated to the post by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Mr. Clinton said his attorney general, Janet Reno, reviewed Mr. Sessions s leadership and concluded  in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Mr. Sessions had been cited for ethical lapses, including taking free trips on F.B.I. aircraft and using government money to build a $10,000 fence at his home. Mr. Sessions was asked to resign, and was fired when he refused to do so.  Despite the president s severe tone, he seemed to regret having to force Mr. Sessions from his post,  The New York Times wrote about his dismissal:WASHINGTON, July 19  President Clinton today dismissed William S. Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who had stubbornly rejected an Administration ultimatum to resign six months after a harsh internal ethics report on his conduct.Mr. Clinton said he would announce his nominee to replace Mr. Sessions on Tuesday. He was expected to pick Judge Louis J. Freeh of Federal District Court in Manhattan; officials said Judge Freeh had impressed Mr. Clinton favorably on Friday at their first meeting.Mr. Clinton, explaining his reasons for removing Mr. Sessions, effective immediately, said,  We cannot have a leadership vacuum at an agency as important to the United States as the F.B.I. It is time that this difficult chapter in the agency s history is brought to a close.  Defiant to the EndBut in a parting news conference at F.B.I. headquarters after Mr. Clinton s announcement, a defiant Mr. Sessions   his right arm in a sling as a result of a weekend fall   railed at what he called the unfairness of his removal, which comes nearly six years into his 10-year term. Because of the scurrilous attacks on me and my wife of 42 years, it has been decided by others that I can no longer be as forceful as I need to be in leading the F.B.I. and carrying out my responsibilities to the bureau and the nation,  he said.  It is because I believe in the principle of an independent F.B.I. that I have refused to voluntarily resign. Mr. Clinton said that after reviewing Mr. Sessions s performance, Attorney General Janet Reno had advised him that Mr. Sessions should go.  After a thorough review by the Attorney General of Mr. Sessions s leadership of the F.B.I., she has reported to me in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Similarly, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey on the recommendation of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. (No relation to William S. Sessions.) There are no United States statutes that discuss the president s authority to remove the F.B.I. director.   NYT s Vince Foster: What the Media Won t Tell You Major media outlets reported Wednesday on the Supreme Court hearing of California lawyer Allan Favish s case that government photographs of Vincent Foster s death scene be released for public viewing. The media report that no fewer than five investigations have found that Foster committed suicide because he was depressed. But despite 10 years of denial by the major media, the Foster case has not  closed    as the Supreme Court hearing Wednesday demonstrated. The case won t close because of the failure of authorities to make full disclosure   and to conduct a full investigation into the case, including a complete autopsy.Vince Foster was not only deputy White House counsel but also the personal attorney to Bill and Hillary Clinton.On the night of Foster s death, top Clinton aides made a frantic effort to enter and remove documents from his West Wing office. In the days that followed, federal investigators were stymied in their investigation of Foster s office and strange death.Since Foster s July 1993 death, the facts of his death have been obfuscated by friends of Bill and Hillary in the major media, but here s the undeniable truth:There weren t  five  investigations into Foster s death, as the media report. The Park Police, best known for their meter and horse patrols around Washington, were put in charge of the initial death inquiry of the most important federal official to die suspiciously since President Kennedy. The Park Police, contradicting standard procedure, declared the death a suicide before launching their inquiry.Later, Robert Fiske, selected by Clinton s counsel Bernie Nussbaum and Janet Reno, quickly confirmed the Park Police probe as a suicide.But when Ken Starr entered the investigation, he reopened the case. His chief prosecutor in the case, Miquel Rodriguez, later quit the Starr investigation, claiming that Starr s staff was engaging in a cover-up of Foster s death.Rodriguez, a Harvard-educated federal prosecutor, argued that one of the Polaroid photos taken of Foster at the crime scene indicated an additional wound on Foster s neck   never noted on the autopsy report. Favish s suit before the Supreme Court is seeking to release this photo, among others.No fewer than three of the paramedics on the scene indicated in reports or testimony that the crime scene was consistent with a murder scene, not a suicide.A careful FBI microscopic investigation of Foster s shoes found not a trace of soil or grass stains on them, though he supposedly walked several hundred yards through wooded Fort Marcy Park to where his body was found. [Years later, Starr s investigation found plenty of soil and grass stains. Rodriguez charged that the shoes were tampered with to produce such  evidence. ]According to the FBI report on Vince Foster s death (below) blonde hairs were found on the body of Vince Foster, but were never investigated:Foster was found with little blood around his body   and despite claims that he fired the gun into his mouth, practically no blood was found on the front of his shirt.Foster was found with a 1913 revolver no one in his family could claim, with two serial numbers, made from the parts of three or more guns. None of Foster s fingerprints were found on the gun.For years, detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling.Significant questions were raised about the unusual gun   a .38 Colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers   found conveniently in Vince s hand.The Park Police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage 1913   and had no pedigree.Foster family members insisted neither Foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver.The NCIC keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers.On March 23, 2001, the FBI responded to requests made by a man names Craig Brinkley:Serial number 356555, one of the numbers on the gun, was never searched, not by the FBI, the Park Police or by that  investigation  by Ken Starr.Serial number 355055 was found on the frame of the gun. Brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber.That number was indeed searched by the Park Police, on the evening of Foster s death, more exactly at 22:45 EDT on July 20, 1993.Interestingly, searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year, before Foster s death, on March 3, March 7 and April 29.Was someone checking to see that this gun had a  clean  predigree and was untraceable?The bullet from the gun that supposedly killed Foster was never found, despite intensive searches.Despite claims to the contrary, no one who knew Foster, including Hillary, Web Hubbell and his own wife, saw signs of depression.A so-called suicide note was found in an office briefcase that had been searched and found to be empty after Foster s death. The note was torn into 27 pieces. Yet an FBI examination found no trace of Foster s fingerprints on the note and a top Oxford handwriting expert found the note to be an  obvious  forgery.Despite the enormity of the case, Foster s autopsy lasted an astounding 45 minutes. The coroner in the case had previously been overruled in other cases he declared  suicides  that were later found to be murders.All of the X-rays taken during the autopsy are missing.Complete crime scene photos don t exist. The Park Police said all the photos were  accidentally  overexposed. A series of close-up Polaroids, which Favish is suing for, remain. This is just a brief summary of the dozens of inconsistencies in the case. Two New York homicide investigators who looked into the case concluded that Foster s body had been moved to the crime scene and that murder could not be ruled out.Despite overwhelming evidence of a cover-up, the media won t question the official ruling.Ken Starr, who could find no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons during his  intensive  probe, confirmed a ruling of suicide. Starr even hired O.J. Simpson s defense expert to prove his case.On August 23, 2016, The Daily Mail revealed that FBI agents  reported interviews documenting that Hillary Clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor Vince Foster in front of White House aides triggered the suicide of Vince Foster were missing from where they should be filed at the National Archives.On the first visit, archivist David Paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the FBI reports of interviews conducted by FBI agents on Foster s death. On a second visit, archivist James Mathis provided what he said were those same documents.While the box contained dozens of FBI reports concerning Foster s death   including interviews with the medical examiner, U.S. Park Police officers, and White House aides about the contents of Foster s office    the reports on Hillary Clinton s role in his death were absent.After filing a Freedom of Information request with the National Archives, Martha Murphy, the archives  public liaison, reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant FBI files, including those that had not been previously made public in response to FOIA requests. He examined all eight boxes but found no interviews by any investigator that detail either a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster or the effects of a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster on Vince Foster s state of mind,  Murphy reported in an email.After firing Republican FBI Director William S. Session, President Bill Clinton temporarily replaced him with Floyd I. Clarke and then on September 1, 1993 he Louis Freeh became the FBI Director. Right from the start, the Freeh FBI was drenched in controversy.

CONDOLEEZZA RICE BRILLIANTLY Shuts Down “The View” Dingbats Over Trump-Russia Collusion [VIDEO],"On more than one occasion, Condoleezza Rice was able correct the record by pointing out the hypocrisy of these ladies in such a way that they didn t even know it. It started with Trump-hater and ABC senior legal analyst Sunny Hostin asking about General Flynn s alleged discussions with Russia weeks before Trump s inauguration asking,  As someone who has had that position as national security advisor, would you have felt comfortable having those discussions, is that inappropriate?  Rice went on to explain how you will have conversations with foreigners, but the thing you shouldn t do is discuss policy. She then went on to say that,  There s only one president  and that as a matter of principle, you can talk to anybody in that period, but you should never suggest that you might be making changes in policy and maybe they should just wait until there s a change in administration. Was Rice referring to the time Obama was caught on a hot mic telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,  This is my last election, after the election, I ll have more flexibility ?While explaining how we should be handling Vladimir Putin s potential meddling in our elections, Rice reminded the panel that when Hillary was Secretary of State she questioned the legitimacy of Putin s election in 2012 and now he s saying,  I m going to question the legitimacy of your election . Rice s answer wasn t quite what The View hacks had hoped for, and like a dog on a bone, The View host Sunny Hostin continued,  But Madame Secretary, if he [Putin] indeed did engage in these kinds of tactics in the election, then the very legitimacy of our election is at issue isn t it? Rice snapped back,  No. Rice then went on to say,  I trust the people who voted in Wisconsin and Texas and Alabama and California to have voted on the basis of who they thought was best gonna represent their interests. So I m not gonna question the legitimacy of their vote because Vladimir Putin tried to interfere in the elections. That s just a step that I m don t think we should take. Let s trust our fellow citizens to have been smart enough to vote for the people they ought to be voting for.  ZING! WATCH:And for the final blow, fake conservative host Jedidiah Bilah  (who, let s face it, is really just collecting a paycheck because she s a token  conservative  who s too weak to stand up for anything) has the opportunity to defend conservatism in some way with one of the most brilliant female conservatives sitting on their panel and she used the opportunity to trash President Trump over his handling of N. Korea.

DEMOCRAT MAXINE WATERS GOES OFF THE RAILS: Smears Trump…Calls Jeff Sessions A Throwback To The Days Of Jim Crow [Video],"This Congresswoman has a potty mouth and a bitter attitude towards whites. She s a hateful racist who is paranoid that everyone is out to get her. She just tossed baseless accusations at the Trump administration in an appearance on The Washington Post podcast  Cape Up with Jonathan Capehart.  (See our previous report on the interview below.)Here are the lowlights:Waters accused President Trump of colluding with Russia during the 2016 election, without offering evidence.  I believe this President has colluded with the Russians, with the Kremlin, with the oligarchs, perhaps, of Russia to undermine our election systems,  Waters told Capehart. (4:00) The California congresswoman also criticized the Senate investigation into Trump-Russia ties as not credible.  They re not moving fast enough!  she exclaimed. However, she praised the media for their investigations into Trump-Russia ties. (4:35) Waters described Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a  throwback to the days of Jim Crow,  equating Sessions with the era of segregation.  I think [Sessions] is a racist and I think he absolutely believes it s his job to keep minorities in their place.  She added that Sessions would like to go back to the days of segregation. (9:30   12:00)As evidence of Sessions  racism, Waters cited an instance where girls in traditional southern dresses greeted Trump and Sessions during the transition period. Waters  implication was that Sessions and Trump enjoyed the clothing because it reminded them of slavery. The group,  The Azalea Trail Maids,  wears colorful traditional dresses to events. (13:50)Capehart finally pushed her to find out if the U.S. government has seen evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.  No, we have not,  Waters said. That means Waters has repeatedly called for Trump s impeachment without yet seeing any evidence of wrongdoing. (20:00)Our previous report on Maxine Waters said the Russia investigation has nothing on Trump:There is probably no one in Congress more openly opposed to President Donald Trump than Maxine Waters. We have already seen that she has called for Trump s impeachment. Therefore when even Waters states there is not yet any evidence at this time of Trump-Russia collusion, that is certainly significant. That is why it is astonishing that Washington Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart left that significant admission made during his own podcast off his May 9 column about it.First let us listen to the segment of Capehart s podcast in which Waters made her surprising admission:How convenient for the left-leaning publication to leave out a direct statement by Maxine Waters. By the way, the title of the article is a rip roaring race baiting title:Maxine Waters: Jeff Sessions believes  it s his job to keep minorities in their place Who does this in 2017? Jeff Sessions is such a good man who DOES NOT deserve such a nasty comment from Congresswoman Waters. Shame on her and shame on Capehart for making this comment the title!JONATHAN CAPEHART: I ve got to ask you, because you leveled a whole lot of accusations out there about collusions and hacking and all of that. Have you seen anything, either through the intelligence briefings, anything to back up any of the accusations that you ve made?MAXINE WATERS: First of all, don t forget that all of our intelligence agencies say, yes, they have the documentation that they did the hacking on the DNC and on some of us.CAPEHART: But the collusion, though?WATERS: No, we have not. That s why investigations are so important, to drill down and to connect those dots and to get the facts. What we have is a lot of smoke that causes us to want to know more about what has happened. Why is it there are so many people around him are connected to oil? Why is it that Michael Flynn, who evidently has a great relationship with Putin, who has received payments for so-called speeches and who s spent a lot of time in Russia and was accused of talking about sanctions, he lied about it and he got caught?In his column writeup about his podcast interview with Maxine Waters, Capehart tossed that admission of no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion down the memory hole.Via: NTK",politics,"May 10, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

After a thorough review by the Attorney General of Mr. Sessions s leadership of the F.B.I., she has reported to me in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Similarly, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey on the recommendation of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. (No relation to William S. Sessions.) There are no United States statutes that discuss the president s authority to remove the F.B.I. director.   NYT s Vince Foster: What the Media Won t Tell You Major media outlets reported Wednesday on the Supreme Court hearing of California lawyer Allan Favish s case that government photographs of Vincent Foster s death scene be released for public viewing. The media report that no fewer than five investigations have found that Foster committed suicide because he was depressed. But despite 10 years of denial by the major media, the Foster case has not  closed    as the Supreme Court hearing Wednesday demonstrated. The case won t close because of the failure of authorities to make full disclosure   and to conduct a full investigation into the case, including a complete autopsy.Vince Foster was not only deputy White House counsel but also the personal attorney to Bill and Hillary Clinton.On the night of Foster s death, top Clinton aides made a frantic effort to enter and remove documents from his West Wing office. In the days that followed, federal investigators were stymied in their investigation of Foster s office and strange death.Since Foster s July 1993 death, the facts of his death have been obfuscated by friends of Bill and Hillary in the major media, but here s the undeniable truth:There weren t  five  investigations into Foster s death, as the media report. The Park Police, best known for their meter and horse patrols around Washington, were put in charge of the initial death inquiry of the most important federal official to die suspiciously since President Kennedy. The Park Police, contradicting standard procedure, declared the death a suicide before launching their inquiry.Later, Robert Fiske, selected by Clinton s counsel Bernie Nussbaum and Janet Reno, quickly confirmed the Park Police probe as a suicide.But when Ken Starr entered the investigation, he reopened the case. His chief prosecutor in the case, Miquel Rodriguez, later quit the Starr investigation, claiming that Starr s staff was engaging in a cover-up of Foster s death.Rodriguez, a Harvard-educated federal prosecutor, argued that one of the Polaroid photos taken of Foster at the crime scene indicated an additional wound on Foster s neck   never noted on the autopsy report. Favish s suit before the Supreme Court is seeking to release this photo, among others.No fewer than three of the paramedics on the scene indicated in reports or testimony that the crime scene was consistent with a murder scene, not a suicide.A careful FBI microscopic investigation of Foster s shoes found not a trace of soil or grass stains on them, though he supposedly walked several hundred yards through wooded Fort Marcy Park to where his body was found. [Years later, Starr s investigation found plenty of soil and grass stains. Rodriguez charged that the shoes were tampered with to produce such  evidence. ]According to the FBI report on Vince Foster s death (below) blonde hairs were found on the body of Vince Foster, but were never investigated:Foster was found with little blood around his body   and despite claims that he fired the gun into his mouth, practically no blood was found on the front of his shirt.Foster was found with a 1913 revolver no one in his family could claim, with two serial numbers, made from the parts of three or more guns. None of Foster s fingerprints were found on the gun.For years, detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling.Significant questions were raised about the unusual gun   a .38 Colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers   found conveniently in Vince s hand.The Park Police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage 1913   and had no pedigree.Foster family members insisted neither Foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver.The NCIC keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers.On March 23, 2001, the FBI responded to requests made by a man names Craig Brinkley:Serial number 356555, one of the numbers on the gun, was never searched, not by the FBI, the Park Police or by that  investigation  by Ken Starr.Serial number 355055 was found on the frame of the gun. Brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber.That number was indeed searched by the Park Police, on the evening of Foster s death, more exactly at 22:45 EDT on July 20, 1993.Interestingly, searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year, before Foster s death, on March 3, March 7 and April 29.Was someone checking to see that this gun had a  clean  predigree and was untraceable?The bullet from the gun that supposedly killed Foster was never found, despite intensive searches.Despite claims to the contrary, no one who knew Foster, including Hillary, Web Hubbell and his own wife, saw signs of depression.A so-called suicide note was found in an office briefcase that had been searched and found to be empty after Foster s death. The note was torn into 27 pieces. Yet an FBI examination found no trace of Foster s fingerprints on the note and a top Oxford handwriting expert found the note to be an  obvious  forgery.Despite the enormity of the case, Foster s autopsy lasted an astounding 45 minutes. The coroner in the case had previously been overruled in other cases he declared  suicides  that were later found to be murders.All of the X-rays taken during the autopsy are missing.Complete crime scene photos don t exist. The Park Police said all the photos were  accidentally  overexposed. A series of close-up Polaroids, which Favish is suing for, remain. This is just a brief summary of the dozens of inconsistencies in the case. Two New York homicide investigators who looked into the case concluded that Foster s body had been moved to the crime scene and that murder could not be ruled out.Despite overwhelming evidence of a cover-up, the media won t question the official ruling.Ken Starr, who could find no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons during his  intensive  probe, confirmed a ruling of suicide. Starr even hired O.J. Simpson s defense expert to prove his case.On August 23, 2016, The Daily Mail revealed that FBI agents  reported interviews documenting that Hillary Clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor Vince Foster in front of White House aides triggered the suicide of Vince Foster were missing from where they should be filed at the National Archives.On the first visit, archivist David Paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the FBI reports of interviews conducted by FBI agents on Foster s death. On a second visit, archivist James Mathis provided what he said were those same documents.While the box contained dozens of FBI reports concerning Foster s death   including interviews with the medical examiner, U.S. Park Police officers, and White House aides about the contents of Foster s office    the reports on Hillary Clinton s role in his death were absent.After filing a Freedom of Information request with the National Archives, Martha Murphy, the archives  public liaison, reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant FBI files, including those that had not been previously made public in response to FOIA requests. He examined all eight boxes but found no interviews by any investigator that detail either a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster or the effects of a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster on Vince Foster s state of mind,  Murphy reported in an email.After firing Republican FBI Director William S. Session, President Bill Clinton temporarily replaced him with Floyd I. Clarke and then on September 1, 1993 he Louis Freeh became the FBI Director. Right from the start, the Freeh FBI was drenched in controversy. The  screw-ups  were legion from the exposure of fraudulent FBI crime lab results to the wrongful blaming of an innocent man for the bombings at the Atlanta Olympics to the bloody standoff and shootout at Ruby Ridge.

BUSTED! WASHINGTON POST Skips Maxine Waters’ Admission Of No Guilt Found In Trump/Russia Collusion [Podcast],"There are 20 Democrats who at certain times have called for Comey to be fired but all you hear this morning is that the firing was done by Trump to stop the Russia investigation. The hypocrisy is HUGE!These people are desperately trying to keep this ball moving down the field. The problem is that there is no  there  there in the Trump/Russia investigation.Even Maxine Waters said the Russia investigation has nothing on Trump:There is probably no one in Congress more openly opposed to President Donald Trump than Maxine Waters. We have already seen that she has called for Trump s impeachment. Therefore when even Waters states there is not yet any evidence at this time of Trump-Russia collusion, that is certainly significant. That is why it is astonishing that Washington Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart left that significant admission made during his own podcast off his May 9 column about it.First let us listen to the segment of Capehart s podcast in which Waters made her surprising admission:How convenient for the left-leaning publication to leave out a direct statement by Maxine Waters. By the way, the title of the article is a rip roaring race baiting title:Maxine Waters: Jeff Sessions believes  it s his job to keep minorities in their place Who does this in 2017? Jeff Sessions is such a good man who DOES NOT deserve such a nasty comment from Congresswoman Waters. Shame on her and shame on Capehart for making this comment the title!JONATHAN CAPEHART: I ve got to ask you, because you leveled a whole lot of accusations out there about collusions and hacking and all of that. Have you seen anything, either through the intelligence briefings, anything to back up any of the accusations that you ve made?MAXINE WATERS: First of all, don t forget that all of our intelligence agencies say, yes, they have the documentation that they did the hacking on the DNC and on some of us.CAPEHART: But the collusion, though?WATERS: No, we have not. That s why investigations are so important, to drill down and to connect those dots and to get the facts. What we have is a lot of smoke that causes us to want to know more about what has happened. Why is it there are so many people around him are connected to oil? Why is it that Michael Flynn, who evidently has a great relationship with Putin, who has received payments for so-called speeches and who s spent a lot of time in Russia and was accused of talking about sanctions, he lied about it and he got caught?In his column writeup about his podcast interview with Maxine Waters, Capehart tossed that admission of no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion down the memory hole.",politics,"May 10, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
BOOM! KELLYANNE CONWAY Schools CNN’s Anderson Cooper On The Comey Firing [Video],"Kellyanne Conway went at it with Anderson Cooper and came out on top when she basically schooled Cooper on the chain of command in government. The facts make no sense to him because he s in denial. Conway said Trump s decision to fire James Comey had nothing to do with the FBI s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. She goes on to explain to Cooper that the letter recommending that Comey be fired was sent to President Trump. Was Trump supposed to then deny the Assistant Attorney General s decision? It s good to note that the Assistant AG was just confirmed by over 90% of the Senate. He s a bipartisan choice and a well respected man who came into his position under AG Jeff Sessions just two weeks ago. The letter sent to Trump summarized the numerous things that prove the case for the recommendation of firing Comey. TRUMP DID NOT DO THIS ALONE But you have the fake news media beating the RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA drums over and over.Watch how Kellyanne Conway runs circles around Anderson Cooper while Cooper just keeps coming back to the Russia scenario: It s not a cover up. The president makes it very clear in his letter. Comey assured him he s not under investigation. I think you re looking at wrong set of facts here. You re going back to the campaign. This man is president of the United States. He acted decisively today. You want this to be about Russia when this is about restoring public confidence in the FBI The FBI director reports to deputy attorney general, the deputy attorney general reports to the attorney general and the attorney general reports to the president of the United States. This has nothing to do with Russia. It has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the president s confidence and can faithfully and capably execute his duties.

THE MOMENT FBI Director James Comey Lost All Credibility [VIDEO],"Hillary Clinton was dogged throughout her campaign by her decision to set up a private email server in the basement of her suburban New York home to handle communications as secretary of state. Comey said in July that agents found 110 classified emails containing emails that were classified at the time they were sent or received. That included eight marked  top secret. Although Comey labeled Clinton s behavior  extremely careless,  he added that it did not warrant prosecution.We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton s personal e-mail account.  James Comey on Hillary s server  Lifezette And here is the hilarious version of Comey Vs. Clinton. Enjoy! All kidding aside Even if we assume Comey didn t botch the Clinton email investigation   which is quite an assumption to make, especially considering how outraged so many investigators in the FBI were in the weeks and months following Comey s announcement   why did the FBI director continue to comment on ongoing investigations? Why did he continue to feed red meat to wolves on both sides of the aisle in Congress?The FBI, regardless of Comey s intentions, has now become a blunt political tool that s being wielded by some of the most dishonest, power-hungry people in the country: politicians. That s not only foolish and reckless, it s dangerous to liberty and undermines the credibility of a group of people that must appear credible in the minds of the people for justice to be served and for liberty to endure.The American people deserve better from their FBI director, and if Comey proves to be incapable of exercising greater prudence, perhaps it s time for someone more careful and considerate to take the helm at one of the world s most powerful government agencies. -The Blaze",politics,"May 9, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
LIST OF COMEY’S 10 BIGGEST SCREW UPS As FBI Director…Why His Firing Was Long Overdue,"Comey will inevitably be remembered for the controversial role he played in the 2016 presidential election, where his agency conducted surveillance of the Trump campaign as well as investigated the Clinton camp for mishandling classified materials, giving both sides arguments for how the FBI ultimately swayed the vote.But even before the 2016 campaign, the FBI endured a number of humiliations under Comey s tenure. Most damning were revelations that the FBI was generally aware of almost every terrorist who successfully struck America over the last eight years.1. Before he bombed the Boston Marathon, the FBI interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev but let him go. Russia sent the Obama Administration a second warning, but the FBI opted against investigating him again.2. Shortly after the NSA scandal exploded in 2013, the FBI was exposed conducting its own data mining on innocent Americans; the agency, Bloomberg reported, retains that material for decades (even if no wrongdoing is found).3. The FBI had possession of emails sent by Nidal Hasan saying he wanted to kill his fellow soldiers to protect the Taliban   but didn t intervene, leading many critics to argue the tragedy that resulted in the death of 31 Americans at Fort Hood could have been prevented.4. During the Obama Administration, the FBI claimed that two private jets were being used primarily for counterterrorism, when in fact they were mostly being used for Eric Holder and Robert Mueller s business and personal travel.5. When the FBI demanded Apple create a  backdoor  that would allow law enforcement agencies to unlock the cell phones of various suspects, the company refused, sparking a battle between the feds and America s biggest tech company. What makes this incident indicative of Comey s questionable management of the agency is that a) The FBI jumped the gun, as they were indeed ultimately able to crack the San Bernardino terrorist s phone, and b) Almost every other major national security figure sided with Apple (from former CIA Director General Petraeus to former CIA Director James Woolsey to former director of the NSA, General Michael Hayden), warning that such a  crack  would inevitably wind up in the wrong hands.6. In 2015, the FBI conducted a controversial raid on a Texas political meeting, finger printing, photographing, and seizing phones from attendees (some in the group believe in restoring Texas as an independent constitutional republic).7. During its investigation into Hillary Clinton s mishandling of classified material, the FBI made an unusual deal in which Clinton aides were both given immunity and allowed to destroy their laptops.8. The father of the radical Islamist who detonated a backpack bomb in New York City in 2016 alerted the FBI to his son s radicalization. The FBI, however, cleared Ahmad Khan Rahami after a brief interview.9. The FBI also investigated the terrorist who killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Despite a more than 10-month investigation of Omar Mateen   during which Mateen admitting lying to agents   the FBI opted against pressing further and closed its case.10. CBS recently reported that when two terrorists sought to kill Americans attending the  Draw Muhammad  event in Garland, Texas, the FBI not only had an understanding an attack was coming, but actually had an undercover agent traveling with the Islamists, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi. The FBI has refused to comment on why the agent on the scene did not intervene during the attack.Via: Grabien",politics,"May 9, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

TIFFANY & CO. TAKES BIG RISK…Sides AGAINST Trump On Very Controversial Issue,"Who knew? Tiffany & Co. just decided to show its hand when it comes to politics. We re not happy to tell you that the luxury retail jeweler just bought into the global warming scam hook, line and sinker The American jeweler is asking the president to keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement.The American jeweler took to social media to send a message to president Donald Trump. Dear President Trump,  read the Instagram and Twitter posts.  We re still in for bold climate action. Please keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement. The disaster of climate change is too real, and the threat to our planet and to our children is too great. The move comes on the same day that the president postponed his decision on whether or not to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, reports CNN. The goal of the agreement is to create  a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 C,  according to European Commission s website.Trump intended on making an announcement before attending the Group of Seven nations summit in Sicily, Italy, on May 26-27, but now, he s going to make a decision after the G7, explained White House press secretary Sean Spicer.Trump has a long history with Tiffany & Co; he named his youngest daughter after the iconic jeweler and the brand s flagship store is connected to Trump Tower in New York. Following the election, sales at the flagship store tumbled 14 percent in November and December, compared with the same period last year. Tiffany & Co. even canceled its holiday window unveiling event due to post-election protests around the area.Read more: Hollywood ReporterWhat they re not telling you is this  agreement  is a HUGE redistribution of American tax dollars to other countries! So if we are to address the Climate crisis we need to challenge the structural causes of the crisis which lies on unequal distribution of wealth, of carbon, and of power. Whether it s political power, economic power, or even military power.  -Camille Risler For many years the public at large has been spoonfed the idea that Global Warming Climate Change, is caused by man s excessive release of carbon into the atmosphere. And that the solution to the Climate crisis was to decrease the production of said gas.Over the past several years the Global Warming fanatics have changed their tune. Many of us in the  new  media have been warning about their true motives for year.Now, instead of the climate crisis being caused by carbon emissions, it is being caused by inequality.On Monday, during a press conference at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, Ms. Camille Risler, a representative of the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) which is an organization listed as an official consultant to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, stated that the cause of Climate Change is the unequal distribution of wealth, carbon, and power: This is the press conference of the Women and constituency. It is one of the nine official constituencies of the UNFCCC, and we are composed of 15 women s rights and feminist organizations from all around the world. So I m going to begin with kind of an overview of our positions and then I will give the floor over to my colleagues that will go more into details of each section of negotiations.I m Camille Risler. I m from France but I m living in Thailand. I m working for a feminist network that is called Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development and I m working for the Climate Justice Program.So what we want to highlight here is that Climate Change is a clear symptom of an unequal and unjust world.

ISLAMIC JUSTICE: Britain Is Stunned When They Discover How Many Secret Sharia Courts Are Operating In UK,"Like dominoes, the Hijra keeps marching across Europe, destroying the distinct cultures of one country after another. Sweden and the UK are in big trouble France is next and thanks to bleeding heart liberal Democrats in America, the U.S. isn t be far behind At least 85 Islamic sharia courts are operating in Britain, a study claimed yesterday.The astonishing figure is 17 times higher than previously accepted.The tribunals, working mainly from mosques, settle financial and family disputes according to religious principles. They lay down judgments which can be given full legal status if approved in national law courts.However, they operate behind doors that are closed to independent observers and their decisions are likely to be unfair to women and backed by intimidation, a report by independent think-tank Civitas said.Commentators on the influence of sharia law often count only the five courts in London, Manchester, Bradford, Birmingham and Nuneaton that are run by the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal, a body whose rulings are enforced through the state courts under the 1996 Arbitration Act.But the study by academic and Islamic specialist Denis MacEoin estimates there are at least 85 working tribunals.The spread of sharia law has become increasingly controversial since its role was backed last year by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams and Lord Phillips, the Lord Chief Justice who stepped down last October.Dr Williams said a recognised role for sharia law seemed  unavoidable  and Lord Phillips said there was no reason why decisions made on sharia principles should not be recognised by the national courts.But the Civitas report said the principles on which sharia courts work are indicated by the fatwas   religious decrees   set out on websites run by British mosques.Mr MacEoin said:  Among the rulings we find some that advise illegal actions and others that transgress human rights standards as applied by British courts. Examples set out in his study include a ruling that no Muslim woman may marry a non-Muslim man unless he converts to Islam and that any children of a woman who does should be taken from her until she marries a Muslim.Further rulings, according to the report, approve polygamous marriage and enforce a woman s duty to have sex with her husband on his demand.The report added:  The fact that so many sharia rulings in Britain relate to cases concerning divorce and custody of children is of particular concern, as women are not equal in sharia law, and sharia contains no specific commitment to the best interests of the child that is fundamental to family law in the UK. Under sharia, a male child belongs to the father after the age of seven, regardless of circumstances. It said:  Sharia courts operating in Britain may be handing down rulings that are inappropriate to this country because they are linked to elements in Islamic law that are seriously out of step with trends in Western legislation. WATCH Muslims demand Shari Law in Britain:The Civitas study said the Islamic courts should no longer be recognised under British law.Its director Dr David Green said:  The reality is that for many Muslims, sharia courts are in practice part of an institutionalised atmosphere of intimidation, backed by the ultimate sanction of a death threat. Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said:  Everyone should be deeply concerned about the extent of these courts. They do entrench division in society, and do nothing to entrench integration or community cohesion. It leads to a segregated society. There should be one law, and that should be British law. We can t have a situation where people can choose which system of law they follow and which they do not. We can t have a situation where people choose the system of law which they feel gives them the best outcome. Everyone should equal under one law.

Son Of Egyptian Immigrants Hopes To Become FIRST MUSLIM GOVERNOR In U.S…Will Push For “Sanctuary State”,"Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a liberal Democrat would like to become the nation s first Muslim Governor in a state that s home to the city of Dearborn, with the highest Muslim population outside of the Middle East. The state of Michigan also made news last year when Hamtramck, a city that for decades was known for it s strong Polish immigrant community, elected its first all-Muslim City Council. It s probably not that far-fetched that the son of Egyptian immigrants living in a state where tens of thousands of Muslim refugees and immigrants come to live would want to see the state of MI become a  Sanctuary State . My faith is really important to me, as it is for many Americans and Michiganders,  El-Sayed said.  But I think we should be asking ourselves rather than how one prays, or what they pray to, we should ask ourselves what [one] prays for and what one hopes for. While El-Sayed said his Islamic values are at the center of his work as a civil servant, he wants people to know his number one priority is to serve the people of Michigan.But some residents in the state may not be ready to see a Muslim governor. In the last several years, Michigan has been a hotbed of Islamophobia. Dearborn, a predominantly Arab-American city in the Detroit metro area, has been a frequent target of anti-Muslim activists, conspiracy theories and fake news. But El-Sayed doesn t want Michigan residents to be distracted by anti-Muslim rhetoric and violence   and he wants people to know that the principles of Islam are what guide his service. I am running because of the values my Islam teaches me   which includes beliefs in equity, the fundamental rights of all people, a belief that we will judge ourselves as a people based on how we treat the most vulnerable,  El-Sayed said.  A belief in being good to others fundamentally, a belief in respect and dignity to one s neighbors and one s friends and one s family. -Business InsiderDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed is starting to propose a progressive platform that includes making Michigan a  sanctuary state,  providing universal preschool and offering publicly funded health insurance to any resident needing coverage.The ex-director of Detroit s health department unveiled parts of his platform Monday.I love it when the rule of law works #sanctuarycities https://t.co/3X4kJBu4WZ  Abdul El-Sayed (@AbdulElSayed) April 26, 2017El-Sayed claims that a Sanctuary State will make Michiganders safer. As a Michigander, I can assure you that making our state a  Sanctuary State  will not only make it less safe, but it will cause many people to move away to states who have laws against law-breakers.(3/3) if elected #gov my job is protecting #Michiganders, that's what #SanctuaryState will do.

US NewsEl-Sayed also made his feelings known on Twitter about a MI lawmaker, Rep. Michele Hoitenga, R-Manton,MI who wants to make Sharia Law illegal in that state of Michigan. El-Sayed attempts to make the comparison of the 10 commandments and the Holy Bible to Sharia Law. What El-Sayed seems to be willfully ignoring, is the fact that the United States is a Judeo-Christian nation.Nice try I oppose banning the #TenCommandments and #Bible   both came from the #MiddleEast. #religiousfreedom https://t.co/j7unpQSkiM  Abdul El-Sayed (@AbdulElSayed) April 20, 2017",politics,"May 8, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

BLACK HARVARD STUDENTS Host Separate Segregated Graduation Ceremony,"According to the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, this year marks Harvard s highest percentage of accepted black students to date. Almost 12 percent of the total applicants who were offered admission next fall are black. Based off Harvard s average student yield of 70 percent, the journal predicts that approximately 170 black students will join the class of 2018. It goes on to stress the fact that American colleges most known for their selectiveness tend to average only 5 to 10 percent black students. -HPBlack students at Harvard University will be hosting their own, separate black-only graduation ceremony.The Root reports more than 125 Harvard graduate students have registered to participate in the separate black graduation ceremony scheduled for May 23.According to The Root, the point of the event is to  acknowledge the struggles and resilience that black students have had to possess in order to thrive in higher education, an environment where minorities are typically underrepresented. Courtney Woods, who is graduating with a master s degree in education policy and management, claimed the event is a way to reclaim Harvard s alleged history  of slavery, epistemic racism and colonization. Woods told The Root,  Harvard s institutional foundation is in direct conflict with the needs of black students. There is a legacy of slavery, epistemic racism and colonization at Harvard, which was an institution founded to train rising imperialist leaders,  she said. This is a history that we are reclaiming. Woods added,  It speaks volumes that there has never been a black graduation ceremony until now.  For entire story: MRCtvHere s another example of self-imposed black segregation at Harvard University. By alienating themselves from the white students and suggesting they  kill themselves  there will never be a chance for black and white students to overcome racism at Harvard. In case you missed it, in March, 2015, we published a story about students at Harvard University who held a debate where black Harvard students argued that white people  should kill themselves  for having  white privilege .

"Former DHS Official Mohamed Elibiary On ISIS Slaughtering Christians: ‘What Goes Around, Comes Around’","Former DHS Official Elibiary is a big supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and was let go from his Homeland Sec post after allegations that he improperly used classified documents. He had also made statements about the eventual return of a Muslim caliphate.Remember this picture warning us all about the Muslim Brotherhood:A former Obama administration official at the Department of Homeland Security said Sunday that when it comes to the Islamic State slaughtering Egyptian Christians,  what goes around, comes around. In a tweet posted Sunday, Mohamed Elibiary, who formerly served as senior member of the DHS  Homeland Security Advisory Council, stated,  Reading ISIS s latest mag  otherizing  Egypt s Copts. Subhanallah how what goes around comes around. Coptic ldrs did same to MB Egyptians. Subhanallah  is Arabic for  Glory to Allah,  and so in this tweet, Elibiary is expressing praise to Allah for the fact that ISIS is killing Egyptian Christians as apparent retribution for Coptic leaders doing the same to members of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.In early May, ISIS published issue 9 of its magazine  Rumiyah,  which is the publication Elibiary is referencing in his tweet.The first article in the new issue is titled  The Ruling on the Belligerent Christians,  and explicitly praises the recent ISIS terror attacks against Coptic Christians in Egypt, also calling for more deadly attacks against Christians and their property. Elibiary referred to this call and other contents in the article as  otherizing  in his tweet. From among these blessed deeds were the successive attacks which the soldiers of the Islamic State in Misr1 and Sinai carried out against the Christians in those lands, targeting them with killings and assassinations, and afflicting their churches with burning and explosions,  the article in Rumiyah states.  Thus, they brought upon them tremendous detriment and deepened their wounds. The last of the blessed attacks against them were the simultaneous explosions at two of their largest churches, one in northern Misr and the other in southern Misr, in the cities of Alexandria and Tanta on their holiday on the 12th of the month of Rajab in the year 1438.

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum for a dinner and ceremony to accept the annual Profile in Courage award, named for a 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Kennedy that profiled eight U.S. senators who risked their careers by taking principled though unpopular positions.Among the long line of guests who made their way down the red carpet into the library for the event Sunday night were members of the Kennedy family, members of Congress, former Obama staffers and celebrities including former late-night talk show host David Letterman.David Letterman?

BREAKING REPORT: ANTIFA THUGS PLACE BOUNTY On Head Of Black Patriot Defending Confederate Monuments [VIDEO],"The next time you hear someone talk about how it s a shame our country is so divided, make sure you tell them to thank a Democrat. We got a glimpse of the underbelly of the Democrat Party during the presidential election when the founder of Project Veritas James O Keefe went undercover to expose the Democrats plan to create chaos and violence and blame it on Trump supporters. The man in the video, Robert Creamer who bragged about his organizing skills had visited Obama s White House over 340 times. He is also the husband of a Democrat Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of IL. Once the real riots got rolling in NYC and Chicago, and Antifa was gaining steam in Berkeley, CA, it was discovered that billionaire radical Democrat George Soros was actually paying to keep the riots going. So it really shouldn t come as any surprise that these basement dwellers have put a bounty on a black man s head simply for having a different political opinion than that of the one he was told he must follow Andrew Duncomb, aka  Black Rebel  has been an outspoken advocate of southern history, and specifically of the Confederate flag and Confederate monuments. We published an article about two great black patriots, the  Black Rebel  and Arlene Dunham, who have bravely stood in the face of hate and insults to defend for what their beliefs. But tonight, new information is coming out about a bounty that has been placed on the head of Duncomb, who according to friends in New Orleans, has gone into hiding.Here is  Black Rebel  telling viewers on his Facebook page about how they can t get any help or protection from police. Black Rebel says they won t be intimidated and will continue to fight for what they believe in:Here are fellow patriots in New Orleans explaining how Antifa has allegedly placed a bounty on  Black Rebel s  head and that he s gone into hiding.

"#NewOrleans: BLACK PATRIOTS Ready To Fight Antifa For Confederate Monuments…Police, Feds Gear Up For Day Of Violence [VIDEO]","May 7th is likely going to be a day of clashes against protesters who are coming from all over the United States to demonstrate against the removal of Confederate monuments in New Orleans. Homeland Security and New Orleans Police Superintendent Michael Harrison have promised that they will be arresting anyone who commits or threatens to commit an act of violence. The three locations they ll be watching are: Lee Circle, Congo Square and the Jefferson Davis monument, as  credible threats  have been reportedTension in New Orleans has mounted since the Battle of Liberty Place obelisk was removed early on the morning of April 24, part of an initiative by Mayor Mitch Landrieu, backed by the City Council, to rid New Orleans of what some consider to be tributes to racism. Supporters consider the monuments part of history, and their removal an attempt to erase history.Protestors on both sides clashed at the Jefferson Davis statute this week, prompting police to barricade the monument. Barricades also appeared Friday afternoon at Lee Circle.Landrieu has said statues of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and P.G.T. Beauregard and Confederacy President Jefferson Davis will come down sometime after the 2017 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival wraps ends Sunday.RADICAL activists like Take  Em Down Nola, a group that has long advocated for the monuments  removal, plans to rally at Congo Square on Sunday at 1:30 p.m then march  to Lee Circle. At least one pro-monument contingent has called for a rally at 11 a.m. at Lee Circle.From the Take  Em Down Nola website:TAKE EM DOWN NOLA CALLS FOR PEOPLES CELEBRATION & SECOND LINE TO BURY WHITE SUPREMACYWhile white supremacists gather from many states around confederate monuments in OUR CITY, the mayor nor council has still not publicly called for its own ceremony to honor the historic occasion of 4 monuments to slavery coming down.  Even the conservative governor of S.C. had a public ceremony to remove the confederate flag. Cowering in darkness offers no safety or protection, it is shameful and being questioned by world wide media.We the people of New Orleans demand that the Mayor and City Council take immediate action to remove all monuments, school names and street signs dedicated to White Supremacists. These structures litter our city with visual reminders of the horrid legacy of slavery that terrorized so many of this city s ancestors. They misrepresent our community. We demand the freedom to live in a city where we are not forced to pay taxes for the maintenance of public symbols that demean us and psychologically terrorize us. We demand:1.That the city release a timeline for the immediate removal of the monuments;  2.That the city expand the definition from 4 specific monuments to encompass all monuments to White Supremacy 3.That the city develop a community driven process for the removal of the monuments and the choosing of their replacements.Not everyone agrees with  Take  Em Down Nola  that Confederate statues are a sign of racism. One of the most vocal defenders of the Confederate flag and of the Confederate statues in New Orleans is black female conservative activist Arlene Barnum. Barnum is pictured below with her friend, author and popular pro-Confederate flag speaker Anthony Hervey. Barnum was with when she says he was killed by 4-5 black youths after attending a pro-confederate flag rally in Mississippi.  According to Barnum, she and Hervey were guest speakers at the rally in Mississippi. As they were leaving the rally, the SUV driven by Hervey was chased down by a silver car with 4-5 young black men inside. During the chase, he lost control of his car, it flipped and he was killed. Apparently his life didn t matter to the black community, as they never uttered a word about his suspicious death:PUBLIC NOTICE.. LISTEN UP very carefully. If anyone of you who claim to be pro-Confederate, but who are anti-Confederate Battle flag, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. And be quick about it.If you are against the displaying of the Confederate Battle Flag in public, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. Do it now!If you are advocating that people NOT bring Confederate Battle Flag into New Orleans at the endangered Confederate monuments, then REMOVE yourself from my friends list. And be quick as lickity split!As far as I know, I don t have any BLM folks on my friends list. And when I catch em thru the cracks, I remove & block them with the most extreme prejudice. However, in the case of these self-professed pro Confederate folks who have issues with that battle flag emblem, I will give them the respect, dignity & the curtesy to REMOVE themselves. I m giving them 72 hrs.In photo, the man to the left, Anthony Hervey is a Mississippian who was not afraid to publicly display the Confederate battle flag. As a colored man, he has been vilified, attacked, physically assaulted, called all sorts of racial insults that not even the average white Confederate flaggers had endured. But yet he kept on flagging proudly until the day he was killed. So don t give me that sh*t excuse to justify hiding the Confederate Battle flag to avoid being called a racist. I guarantee you that EVERY colored Confederate flagger I know have been called much worse & treated with violence & are the 1st to be targeted at public venues.You better not be black and support free speech or a Confederate monument in America or expect to be threatened by the left. This is no joke. Facebook user Gene Black threatened a black Confederate statue supporter s family while he s in New Orleans on his wall 4 days ago:Much like ISIS, pro-Confederate monument removal groups like Take  Em Down Nola and communist groups like Antifa plan to come together to threaten free speech and freedom of expression.Black Rebel posted this image with the following message:  words cannot described the friendships built after fighting side by side.  on his Facebook page: Black Rebel also posted this video of an anti-free speech leftist launching a glass bottle, just missing the head of a fellow pro-confederate monument protester. Watch how the police take their time walking over to the area from where the bottle was thrown. You can hear the free speech protesters yelling,  Do something!  to the police officers as they appear to be in no hurry to do anything about it. Let s hope this is not an example of how police plan to respond to any potential acts of violence today, or things are likely to get very ugly very quickly: New Orleans Police Department held a press conference on Saturday where they made the public aware they are planning to keep the citizens of New Orleans safe and will keep the protesters safe from violence and from the threat of violence. Police Chief Harrison also makes it clear that they will take swift action for anyone who violates the law. Chief Harrison also makes clear that while they respect the rights of citizens to open carry weapons in New Orleans, that those weapons are not allowed at a public protest:Watch the response from American Warrior Revolution member to New Orleans Police Chief Harrison s press conference:",politics,"May 7, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
JUDGE JEANINE SLAMS HILLARY IN EPIC OPENING STATEMENT: “Snap out of it!”…”You’re A Two Time Loser!” [Video],"Judge Jeanine Pirro SLAMS Hillary Clinton after Clinton blamed WikiLeaks and Jim Comey s letter on October 28th for losing the election to President Trump.Judge Jeanine called Clinton a  loser  and told her to go back into the woods Hillary, snap out of it,  Pirro said.  I m tired of going through this with you. You re a two-time loser who lost because you were a lousy candidate, you didn t have a message, you lied every time you opened your mouth; you didn t know what states to campaign in, you put our national security at risk with your amateur email setup, you were in a foundation that was nothing more than an organized criminal enterprise parading as a charity, four men died under your watch as you lied about a video, and there were a billion dollars missing from the State Department when you left. And I could go on and on, but I just don t have the time. So, stop with the poor me nonsense. We ve had it with you Clintons always claiming victimhood. The two of you haven t followed the rules since the day you both showed up in your bell bottoms in Arkansas. Be careful, Hillary. Be very, very careful. You pulled the wool over Jim Comey s eyes once, and you actually got the president to say you re a nice lady. Don t be so sure you re going to get away with your new game, given your illegal, ill-advised, and incompetent instincts.You re a loser, Hillary. Face it. Face it, and get back in the woods!

With the camera weaving, it was understood that the journalist and her cameraman were fleeing and the voice of the reporter changed in tone into an actual cry of fear. A few minutes later, Porro, from the studio, explained that,  Francesca is upset but well. They have destroyed the camera and beaten the cameraman. A situation such as this evening s should not be a report from a war zone. Thanks to a taxi driver, a much worse outcome was avoided.  The version was confirmed by Parisella herself, by telephone shortly thereafter.  We were at a distance to report on the type of welcome we can give; they were disturbed and they assaulted us.

BLOCKBUSTER COURT RULING On Obama/Clinton Benghazi Emails Forces The Hand Of The State Department,"Thanks to Judicial Watch for keeping it up with the effort to find out more on what happened in Benghazi. We know that the State Department was and still is protecting Hillary Clinton and Obama. We know that it s hard to keep up the hope that these crooks will be held accountable for what they did. Rest assured that Judicial Watch is calling out the State Department on this and especially Patrick Kennedy (see more on Kennedy below).(Washington, DC)   Judicial Watch today announced that U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has ordered the U.S. Department of State to turn over to Judicial Watch  eight identical paragraphs  of previously redact material in two September 13, 2012, Hillary Clinton emails regarding phone calls made by President Barack Obama to Egyptian and Libyan leaders immediately following the terrorist attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi.Both emails had the subject line  Quick Summary of POTUS Calls to Presidents of Libya and Egypt  and were among the emails stored on Clinton s unofficial email server.Judge Jackson reviewed the documents directly and rejected the government s contention that the records had been properly withheld under the FOIA B(5)  deliberative process  exemption.Judge Jackson ruled:  the two records, even if just barely predecisional, are not deliberative. [The State Department] has pointed to very little to support its characterization of these two records as deliberative, and the Court s in camera review of the documents reveals that they do not fall within that category. The full emails may reveal what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama knew about the September 11, 2012, terror attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi.Following Judge Jackson s March 20 ruling, the State Department asked the court to reconsider. The State Department argued that, due to an internal  mistake,  it failed to claim that the emails were classified and, therefore, exempt from production under FOIA Exemption B(1).In response, Judicial Watch argues that the failure was not a mistake, but instead was part of a deliberate effort by the State Department to protect Clinton and the agency by avoiding identifying emails on Clinton s unofficial, non-secure email server as classified.Judicial Watch s filing cites an interview of an FBI employee who told federal investigators that top State Department official Patrick Kennedy pressured the FBI to keep Clinton s emails unclassified. The employee told the FBI he  believes STATE ha[d] an agenda which involves minimizing the classified nature of the CLINTON emails in order to protect STATE interests and those of CLINTON. :FBI documents say Kennedy offered the FBI additional positions overseas if the  Secret  label, the middle level of classification, would be removed. Clinton, who used a private server for her emails while she was secretary of state, has contended she never sent or received classified information. The FBI has ruled otherwise.4 KEY PEOPLE OUT   PARTICULARLY PATRICK KENNEDY:Judicial Watch s filing also cites an interview of a State Department employee who told the FBI that the State Department s Office of Legal Counsel interfered with the FOIA processing of email from Secretary Clinton s server, instructing reviewers to use Exemption B(5) (deliberative process exemption) instead of Exemption B(1) (classified information exemption). According to the FBI interview:STATE s Near East Affairs Bureau upgraded several of CLINTON s emails to a classified level with a B(1) release exemption . [Redacted], along with [Redacted] attorney, Office of Legal Counsel, called STATE s Near East Affairs Bureau and told them they could use a B(5) exemption on a upgraded email to protect it instead of the B(1) exemption. However, the use of the B(5) exemption, which is usually used for executive privilege-related information, was incorrect as the information actually was classified and related to national security, which would be a B(1) exemption.Judicial Watch argues:An agency s deliberate withholding of a FOIA claim, either to gain a tactical advantage or, as appears to be the case here, to protect the agency s interests and those of its former head, is  a motive undoubtedly inconsistent with FOIA s broad remedial purpose   It  counsels denying the Government s request. The emails in question were sent to then-top administration officials, including Clinton, Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Clinton Deputy Chief of Staff Jacob Sullivan, Special Assistant Robert Russo, and Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough. Does President Trump know his State and Justice Departments are still trying to provide cover for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama?  said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  An extraordinary court ruling that could result in key answers about the Benghazi outrage is being opposed by the Trump administration. This may well be an example of the  deep state  trying to get away with a cover up   if so then the Trump administration must put a stop to it. Judicial Watch obtained the original documents in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:14-cv-01511)). The lawsuit was filed on September 4, 2014, after the State Department failed to respond to a June 13, 2014, FOIA request seeking:All records related to notes, updates, or reports created in response to the September 11, 2012 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. This request includes, but is not limited to notes taken by then Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or employees of the Office of the Secretary of State during the attack and its immediate aftermath. The timeframe for this request is September 11-15, Judicial Watch s numerous FOIA lawsuits have forced the State Department to release hundreds of Benghazi-related documents.THIS IS ALL WE NEED TO SEE TO BE REMINDED TO KEEP UP THE FIGHT FOR TRUTH Via: Judicial Watch",politics,"May 6, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

VIDEO: HARLEM BAR Kicks Customers Out For Wearing Trump Hats: “We don’t play that sh*t here”,"A large group of very diverse young adults who call themselves  The Modern Patriots videotaped themselves being kicked out of the  Grill On The Hill  bar located at Amsterdam Ave. and W. 140th St in Harlem for wearing Trump hats. 100 Percent FED UP spoke with one of the young adults who was part of the group to find out why they were kicked out. According to the young lady we spoke with, The Modern Patriots group had just finished giving a speech at the City College across the street and decided to go out together to have a drink. They looked for the nearest bar, and happened to end up across the street at the  Grill On The Hill . There were 15 people in their group; 3 females and 12 males. Some of the males had MAGA (Make America Great Again) hats on. When they entered the bar, a young woman began screaming that she was offended by their MAGA hats. Other customers in the bar joined in and started jeering at them. It was then that they were told to leave.The groups who call themselves  The Modern Patriots  can be seen in the video below chanting,  USA, USA  as they were being kicked out of the bar. A large black man in a blue shirt followed them out of the bar and approached them. He warned them as they were leaving,  It s a very sensitive time. Be careful with that.  The young patriots appeared frustrated with the treatment they received from the bar, but responded in a very respectful manner. The man wearing the blue shirt in the video asked,  Do you know where you re at?  to which one of the students who was kicked out of the bar responded, Yeah, America! We talked to one of the young female Trump supporters who was with the group when they were kicked out. She explained how the customer in the bar who was triggered by their hats followed the bouncer outside the bar, engaging them in a shouting match. The bouncer was admonishing the young adults wearing MAGA hats, while attempting to move them off the public sidewalk, when the female customer who started the issue inside the bar stepped outside and began taunting the Trump supporters. The female patriot who was part of the group explained to us what happened once they we re forced outside:  I told him [the bouncer] we have our own opinion and he responded that the people in the bar had their opinion too. That woman was screaming at our friend and he gave her the middle finger when we were already outside of the bar but she started everything like she owns the place. She started all of this and when the bouncer came outside she did as well and added fuel to fire. But the bouncer was agreeing with them and told us to relax. We did not go there to cause problems we wear our maga hats all over NYC and we rarely have issues. We felt discriminated by this bar and even now they re trying to justify why they kicked us out on their page. Most of the people we were with attend the college nearby and live in the neighborhood but they are basically telling us we don t belong here. I m not for the identity politics no matter where we go we find supporters so they can keep their segregated bar and we will keep on protecting free speech. The man in the blue shirt continues to warn the young adults who dared to wear their Trump hats into the bar,  Be careful out there. It ain t no joke. It ain t no meme. Be careful out there.  He continue to threaten them,  We don t play that shit here.  He tells them to  take that shit where you live.  to which one of the Trump supports says,  I live here!  His response is priceless:  I don t give a f**k where you live. Is the man in the blue shirt suggesting this crowd of young adults who represent just about every racial group in America, had no business being in a bar whose customer base is primarily black? What about the college across the street? Do they only allow black students to drink at their bar?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa1m2N3W5tE&feature=shareThe best line in the video comes near the end of the confrontation when the man in the blue shirt says,  This ain t a democracy. Be careful with yourselves.  At which point the young patriots begin to laugh and walk away to avoid confrontation as they chant, He will not divide us! Here is a sample of some of the responses Grill On The Hill received under their post on their Facebook page, where they tried to explain why they kicked the large group of young adults supporting our President out of their bar: The popular online restaurant review service Yelp shut down the comments section on the  Grill On The Hill  after they were overwhelmed by  reviews  after the story began to circulate on social media:We took screen shots of a few of the reviews that were mostly hidden from users of the YELP review service.The first reviewer starts out by mocking the man in the blue shirt saying:  Be careful with that.  They told people who are low on melanin to go back to downtown. Racists.The second reviewer claimed YELP would not allow her to give  Grill On The Hill  ZERO stars.  She went on to say,  Anyone who lets a person political opinion interfere with them tryout to enjoy a night out is bull. You say free speech but kick people out for wearing trump hats. Shame on you. That s talking out of both sides of your mouth. Stay away. Far away. We called Grill On The Hill to speak with the owners to get their side of the story. The owners were unavailable.",politics,"May 6, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
LAS VEGAS: ILLEGAL ALIEN ARRESTED For Filming Himself Committing Unspeakable Act Against 4 Year Old Girl,"Did you know that in the state of Texas alone over the last few years, more than 2000 illegal aliens were deported after committing sex crimes?Did you know that in the state of Texas alone over the last few years, nearly a thousand illegal aliens have been convicted of sex crimes against children?Of course you didn t. The media has covered these horrors up for years, and even after Donald Trump dared reveal these horrors, the rape-deniers in the media continue to cover them up. The media is covering up all kinds of horrific statistic regarding illegal aliens. Before we get to those, let s start with why.To Democrats and their media allies, a few hundred raped children a year is seen as a small price to pay for the political benefits that come with an unsecure border. Mexicans vote 3-to-1 for Democrats.Of the 862 alien sex offenders deported by the Texas-based offices, about 27 percent were convicted of sex offenses against children. -BreitbartYesterday in Las Vegas, a Hispanic immigrant was been arrested for allegedly raping a toddler in Las Vegas. The man accused of raping a 4-year-old girl and videotaping the entire sexual assault on his cellphone has been placed on an immigrant detainer. It is not currently known if the accused child rapist is a legal or illegal immigrant.Julio Cesar Medrano, 23, also goes by the alias,  Julio Rodriguez.  The Las Vegas resident was arrested on child rape charges on April 21. The sexual assault happened on April 3, according to the time stamp on the 30-second cellphone video, police investigators.Julio Medrano was arrested after a woman found the video appearing to depict the immigrant raping the child.

The charges levied against the Hispanic immigrant include sexual assault against a child younger than 14, child abuse or neglect, producing and possessing child pornography, possession of a dangerous weapon, and carrying a concealed knife without a permit, according to the Clark County Detention Center online records database.For entire story  Inquisitr",politics,"May 6, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
WHY LET THE ATHEISTS Run All Over You? City Removes Bench Honoring Veterans,"A city in Pennsylvania is removing a park bench with a religious quote in order to placate angry atheists. The atheists wants to put their own bench there instead: This bench was put there to honor veterans! Is nothing sacred anymore? The site reads:  The quote by William Penn, appearing on the Tyrants Bench, honors Pennsylvania s founding father, as well as the men and women who gave their lives to protect the rights of all U.S. citizens Men who aren t governed by God, will be governed by tyrants Does anyone else see the irony in this quote? OIL CITY, Pa.   An atheist group in New Jersey is seeking the removal of a bench at a Pennsylvania park that is meant to honor veterans due to an inscription of a quote attributed to the state s founder that mentions God. American Atheists (AA) recently sent a letter to the mayor of Oil City to request that the Justus Park bench, which was donated in 2003 by a local branch of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), be removed out of its belief that its inscribed text violates the U.S. Constitution.  Men who aren t governed by God, will be governed by tyrants,  the bench reads, paraphrasing a quote that is often attributed to Pennsylvania founder William Penn, a Quaker who wrote a number of theological books and who once stood trial for  causing a tumult  in preaching in the streets. AA contends that the quote violates the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which instructs that  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.  The group also says the text is disrespectful to non-Christians. The Tyrants Bench contains an overtly religious message which endorses one particular religious viewpoint: Christianity. The statement that  Men who aren t governed by God will be governed by tyrants  not only has absolutely nothing to do with honoring our service members, but is derisive toward the all non-Christian American service members who have served and died for this country,  its letter asserted. It offered to provide a secular bench in exchange for the current display.Read more: Christian News",politics,"May 6, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

"AFTER 5 YEARS Of Being Bullied By Barack Obama, President Trump Signs Religious Liberty Exec Order To Protect “Little Sisters Of The Poor”"," Freedom is not a gift from government. It is a gift from God.    President Donald J. Trump, May 4, 2017The Little Sisters correctly insist that sterilizations, abortifacient chemical birth control and artificial contraception are all immoral. They are not only against the teaching of the scripture and Christian tradition but, as Catholics, the Sisters also maintain that they violate the Natural Moral Law.The Obama administration has asked the Court to compel these Little Sisters of the Poor to do indirectly what they refuse to do directly. They asked the Court to force Catholic nuns to sin, to act against conscience, to pursue an immoral course of action. The nuns were placed in a situation reminiscent of other times in the history of the Church when unjust rulers sought to compel the Church to bend the knee to Caesar.Here are what the Little Sisters Of The Poor are all about. One look at these lovely women who have devoted their lives to God and to helping others in need, and you will see why President Trump made helping them live their faith without fear of persecution a priority:President Donald Trump signed a religious liberty executive order today that would protect Christian organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor from being forced to pay for abortions.Today is the National Day of Prayer and the White House is celebrating the occasion with Christian leaders by scheduling the order signing today. The order is a promise to respect religious rights and could pave the way for the Trump administration dropping the lawsuit the Obama administration was fighting against the Little Sisters and dozens of Christian entities not wanting to pay for abortions or abortion-causing drugs.The order indicates the Trump administration will  provide regulatory relief for religious objectors to Obamacare s burdensome preventive services mandate, a position supported by the Supreme Court decision in Hobby Lobby. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins was at the White House for the signing ceremony of an executive order protecting religious liberty. He told LifeNews.com that the new order ensures the freedom of all Americans to believe and act in accordance with their beliefs. The executive order makes clear that the administration will pursue policies that  protect and vigorously promote religious liberty. The President s executive order is a clear reflection of his campaign promise to protect the religious freedoms of Americans. President Trump is taking a significant first step to defending religious liberty. In working with the Trump administration, it is clear that they both recognize and understand the dangers of the anti-faith policies of the previous administration and are therefore committed to undoing those policies and restoring true religious freedom,  he said.  The freedom to live out faith in all areas of society without government punishment or intimidation is what has made America great.

ELLEN Just Proved She’s A HUGE Hypocrite And Knows NOTHING About Trump [Video],"Someone needs to educate Ellen DeGeneres on President Trump. She obviously knows nothing about him or his policies that DO include ALL Americans! He just not into identity politics like Obama was.She claims that his views on immigrants and women aren t aligned with hers. So isn t she doing what she proclaims to object to when she refuses to have Trump on simply because of his views?He is FOR immigrants but for LEGAL IMMIGRANTS. Does Ellen advocate for illegally coming to America? Traditionally, talk show hosts salivate at the mere thought of the president of the United States visiting their chatfests.Ellen DeGeneres? Not so much.President Donald Trump isn t welcome on  The Ellen DeGeneres Show,  the comedienne told Matt Lauer in an interview that aired on NBC s  Today  on Friday,  because I m not gonna change his mind. He s against everything that I stand for. DeGeneres said she had met Trump in the past; the two filmed a  Celebrity Apprentice -related segment for her show years ago. I flew in his helicopter and did a bit with him, so I knew him then,  she said.  I have not spoken to him since he s run for president or become president. DeGeneres, who recently celebrated the 20th anniversary of her coming out as a lesbian during an episode of her sitcom  Ellen,  implied that Trump s well-documented comments about women and immigrants, among other topics, do not jibe with her own views and do not seem to be malleable.Read more: NYP",politics,"May 5, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

FEINSTEIN EMBARRASES HERSELF DURING QUESTIONING TO NEIL GORSUCH:Senator Dianne Feinstein is no match for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. In her questioning today she really made a fool of herself when she tossed out a question that made it clear she hadn t done her homework on Gorsuch. He answered her question by citing numerous specific cases in his legal history. It s understandable that the Democrats are trying to play to their base by dragging out the process of asking ridiculous questions of this perfect nominee for the SCOTUS.

FBI DIRECTOR CONFIRMS Hillary’s Worst Nightmare Was Found On This Creep’s Laptop [VIDEO],"Be careful what you ask for Watch:  FBI Director James Comey testified Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Hillary Clinton emails containing classified information were forwarded to the computer of Anthony Weiner, the former congressman, by his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin.Comey also strongly defended himself on Capitol Hill for his Oct. 28 letter notifying Congress of newly discovered emails appearing pertinent to Clinton s private server investigation, arguing it would have been  catastrophic  to conceal such a revelation.He explained that his investigative team informed him in late October of metadata from Weiner s computer showing thousands of Clinton s emails on that device, including what they thought might be the  missing emails  from her first three months at the State Department.Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 over a sexting scandal and saw a 2013 mayoral run in New York City go up in flames for similar reasons. The investigation that led to Comey s letter concerned his sexting with an underage girl.

NOT KIDDING! High School Assignment: “Prudence is thirty-four. She has had sex with 21 men and 3 women”," Prudence is thirty-four. She has had sex with twenty-one men and three women,  according an assignment for high schoolers in Scotland County, Missouri. After being celibate for three years, she meets Larry and a romance begins to develop. Larry is thirty-seven. One night he proposes that, things going the way he thinks they re going between them, they talk about their sexual histories. A concerned mother recently contacted Fox News columnist Todd Starnes about the assignment after her child received it in an English class at Scotland County R-1 Junior-Senior High School. Larry confesses to having slept with three women, one of whom he married. She tells him that she has slept with three men. Larry is uncomfortable with this number, especially since Prudence is younger than he is,  the assignment continued.  She amends it, saying that one was just heavy petting. Given Prudence s reflexive need for approval and Larry s clear ideas of how things should be, what percentage of the time will Prudence be inhibited in bed with Larry, and consequently fake orgasm to ease his pride? Here is a photo of the assignment: This is something I imagine you would see on a coffee table in every brothel,  the irate mother told Starnes.The unidentified woman said she contacted the school s principal, who provided a lame excuse for the assignment. He told me that the teacher was originally a college teacher and he sometimes has trouble differentiating between what is appropriate for a 15- or 16-year-old and a 19 or 20-year-old,  she said.For entire story: EAG News",politics,"May 5, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

STEPHEN COLBERT’S RESPONSE To His Vulgar Remarks About Trump Made Americans Want Him Fired Even More…#FireColbert [VIDEO],"Johnny Carson must be rolling over in his grave to see what s happened to late night comedy where he dedicated 30 years of his life to actually making people of all political persuasions laugh. If Johnny Carson had a particular political leaning, his viewers wouldn t have known what it was. When it came to criticizing President s of the United States, he was always funny but never hateful and certainly never vile. A lot has changed since then. It wasn t so long ago that  comedians  like Stephen Colbert only dreamed of sitting in one of the coveted late night comedy spots like the one Johnny Carson created. David Letterman s hate for conservatives and Republicans didn t really surfaced until he was nearing the end of his career, and although many wish he would keep his hateful opinions about our President to himself, he is a private citizen now and is not accountable to anyone for his petty remarks. The big question is, will anyone at CBS hold his predecessor Stephen Colbert responsible for his vile remarks about Trump having oral sex with Vladimir Putin? Will Colbert s advertisers pull their advertising dollars from his show like they did to FOX News  Bill O Reilly, after unproven allegations of sexual assault were made against him?As sad as it was to the world of comedy when Johnny Carson passed away, it s a good thing he isn t able to see how that the hateful and spiteful liberal Stephen Colbert has disgraced and replaced what once was considered late-night comedy.Last night, Stephen Colbert responded to #FireColbert backlash over a crude oral-sex joke he made about President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on Monday, May 1. Trump supporters and others thought the comment was inappropriate and called for the comedian to be dropped from the CBS show.The TV host, 52, opened his Wednesday, May 3, episode by addressing the controversy.  Welcome to The Late Show,  he said.  I m your host, Stephen Colbert. Still? I am still the host? I m still the host! Colbert went on to explain that his scathing monologue was spurred by Trump abruptly ending an Oval Office interview with fellow CBS correspondent John Dickerson.  Now, if you saw my monologue Monday, you know that I was a little upset at Donald Trump for insulting a friend of mine,  he said.  So at the end of that monologue, I had a few choice insults for the president in return. I don t regret that. He, I believe, can take care of himself. I have jokes; he has the launch codes. So, it s a fair fight.

But it sounds like it was sent from someone who worked closely with Lynch, and sent to someone who was very worried about Clinton going down in flames, probably someone very close to Clinton.At the end of the segment, Herridge pointed out that Comey suggested he was boxed in by Lynch and here is what she s talking about: ",politics,"May 4, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

BREAKING NEWS: GOP Controlled House Votes To REPEAL Obamacare,"After years of debate, the House on Thursday voted to repeal key parts of the Affordable Care Act and replace them with new provisions.The vote, which President Donald Trump was planning to tout as a big victory, sends the Republican-sponsored bill to gut Obamacare to the Senate for consideration.But winning approval for the bill could be even more difficult in the Senate than it has been in the House, where Republican leaders struggled for nearly two months to wrangle enough votes in their caucus to secure its passage.The bill passed by a vote of 217 to 213. All 193 Democrats voting opposed the bill; they were joined by 20 Republicans voting  no. A lot of us have waited seven years to case this vote,  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said shortly before the voting began.  Many of us are here because we pledged to cast this vote: to repeal and replace Obamacare. This bill delivers the promises we have made to the American people,  Ryan said.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told MSNBC shortly before the vote began,  We were elected to do this. After the vote, protesters outside the Capitol building yelled,  Shame, shame!  at members of Congress walking down the front steps.  CNBCWashington Free Beacon   One of the amendments, introduced by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R., N.J.), co-chair of the Tuesday Group, allows states to obtain a waiver from federal standards such as essential health benefits and community rating rules. This measure gained the support of House Freedom Caucus members, who said it will significantly lower health costs, even if it does not fully repeal Obamacare. The MacArthur amendment will grant states the ability to repeal cost driving aspects of Obamacare left in place under the original AHCA,  said the House Freedom Caucus.  While the revised version still does not fully repeal Obamacare, we are prepared to support it to keep our promise to the American people to lower health care costs. Another amendment, introduced by Rep. Fred Upton (R., Mich.) adds $8 billion to the Patient and State Stability Fund, which helps reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs. This amendment would provide additional funding, $8 billion over five years, to ensure a strong safety net and reduce premiums, or other out-of-pocket costs, for those with preexisting conditions,  said Upton.Following the amendment, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the White House supported the measure and that President Trump has been working to ensure that Americans have more affordable care. Overall the efforts that were made, and especially the effort this morning with congressmen Long and Upton, help bring more people into this effort and make it even a stronger bill, and ensure that Americans have a health care system that gets them the care that they need at a price that s affordable,  Spicer said. The president has been on the phone constantly,  Spicer said.  I think we have made this an unbelievable bill and an unbelievable replacement for Obamacare, which is failing, and that s what we ve sought to do from the beginning.

"WATCH What Happens When Random People Are Asked To Sign Petition Allowing ALL ILLEGAL ALIEN Murderers, Rapists To Be Freed From Prison [VIDEO]","Hilarious conservative media analyst and Youtube sensation Mark Dice took to the streets of Los Angeles in 2013 while President Obama was still occupying our White House. He asked random people walking down the street if they would sign a petition to  support violent criminals to be released from our prisons and onto our streets. It s interesting to see how many people accept that illegal aliens in our prisons are not being treated unfairly without any evidence. This false narrative was successfully promoted by Barack Obama, our media and the Democrats, who decided that illegal aliens should be not just be given equal treatment to American citizens, but instead, they should be given special treatment above and beyond those afforded to American citizens.Watch the video and check out the new statistics below that were just released by Zogby, showing that Hispanics in America now support President Trump more than any other demographic. Apparently supporting illegal aliens who commit crimes in America is no longer cool under a Trump administration:Most of the people who are seen signing this petition, are Hispanic. But that s when we had a president who shamed Americans into believing that giving special privileges to illegal aliens was expected. Today however, is a different story In its latest survey, Zogby Analytics said that Hispanic support has hit 45 percent, two points higher than the president s generic approval.That is 55 percent higher than the total Latino vote for Trump in the election. He won just 29 percent. The biggest surprise in this new poll is Trump s approval among Hispanic voters, which is at 45 percent approval/51 percent disapproval. In February the numbers were less among Hispanics at 39 percent approval/53 percent disapproval,  said Zogby.Via: Washington Examiner ",politics,"May 4, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

U.S. ATTORNEY ON FIRE: Why FBI Director Comey “Is A Danger To This Country” [Video],"Did you see the testimony from FBI Director Comey yesterday? The two words that stand out are the words  mildly nauseous :FBI director James Comey said he s  mildly nauseous  about the possibility that his announcement about reopening an investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails influenced the outcome of the election  Tessa Berenson, Time (time.com), 3 May 2017Tucker Carlson interviewed US Attorney Joe diGenova:DOES THE FBI DIRECTOR HAVE TOO MUCH POWER?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzdGKmo3-A8diGenova was on fire during this interview:  I got mildly nauseous listening to his testimony one more time,  diGenova said, referring to Comey s own feelings about possibly affecting the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. James Comey is a danger to the country,  diGenova said.  He surrounds himself with his own cult of personality. He believes that he is the last righteous man left standing. When Comey held a news conference July 5, 2016 where he  accused Hillary Clinton and then exonerated her,  diGenova said,  he violated every rule and regulation of the department of justice. He should have been fired that day. President Donald Trump should not have kept him after his inauguration, he added. He should be fired for the testimony that he has given over the last few months,  diGenova added.  That July 5 news conference was the original sin. From it, everything else followed. In answer to Comey s question to his critics of what they would have done differently, diGenova said,  Mr. Director, I would have done nothing, because I never would have held the July 5 news conference, which forced you to send two letters to Congress. Comey, as FBI director, is a cop, he said, but instead took on the role of a prosecutor, stealing the job of the Justice Department. But the Justice Department, headed then by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, was left unable to respond because of Lynch s private meeting with Clinton s husband, former President Bill Clinton, in Clinton s plane at the Phoenix airport. The entire Department of Justice was so frightened of Jim Comey because of the way they had politically mishandled the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, that they were afraid to contradict him,  he said.  That is what you call a disaster in a government of accountability. He stole the work of the Department of Justice in a single day, and they sat there and watched it. A pox on all of their houses.

NEW BIOGRAPHY Exposes Barack Obama’s Dream Of Becoming Donald Trump,"Barack Obama s white college girlfriend Sheila Miyoshi Jager, who is now a professor at Oberlin College, tells a story of a very calculating man who was not about to let her race get in the way of his political ambitions: In the winter of  86, when we visited my parents, he asked me to marry him,  she told Garrow. Her parents were opposed, less for any racial reasons (Barack came across to them like  a white, middle-class kid,  a close family friend said) than for concern about Obama s professional prospects, and because her mother thought Sheila, two years Obama s junior, was too young.  Not yet,  Sheila told Barack. But they stayed together.In early 1987, when Obama was 25, she sensed a change.  He became. . . so very ambitious  very suddenly,  she told Garrow.  I remember very clearly when this transformation happened, and I remember very specifically that by 1987, about a year into our relationship, he already had his sights on becoming president. Discussions of race and politics suddenly overwhelmed Sheila and Barack s relationship.  The marriage discussions dragged on and on,  but now they were clouded by Obama s  torment over this central issue of his life . . . race and identity,  Sheila recalls. The  resolution of his black identity was directly linked to his decision to pursue a political career,  she said.At Harvard, the Obama the world has come to know took clearer form. In his late 20s now and slightly older than most classmates, he had a compulsion to orate in class and summarize other people s arguments for them.  In law school the only thing I would have voted for Obama to do would have been to shut up,  one student told Garrow. Classmates created a Obamanometer, ranking  how pretentious someone s remarks are in class. If Garrow is indeed correct in concluding that Obama s romantic choices were influenced by his political ambitions, it is no small irony that Michelle Obama became one of those most skeptical about Obama s political prospects, and most dubious about his will to rise. She constantly discourages his efforts toward elective office and resents the time he spends away from her and their two young daughters. Obama vented to a friend how often Michelle would talk about money.  Why don t you go out and get a good job? You re a lawyer   you can make all the money we need,  she would tell him, as the couple struggled with student loans and the demands of family and political life. (Garrow sides with Michelle, highlighting how, on the day after Sasha was born, Barack went downtown for a meeting.)As he considered a U.S. Senate bid, Obama s team commissioned a poll that covered, among other questions, his name.  Barry,  as he was known from childhood into his early college years, polled better than  Barack,  but Obama never considered resurrecting the old name. He had made his choice, of identity and image, long ago. Sheila recalls that one of the few times Obama became genuinely angry with her was in Hawaii, when she heard relatives calling him Barry, and she did so as well, just for fun. He became  irrationally furious,  she said.  He told me that under no circumstances was I ever to use that name with him. There was no going back.The sense of destiny is not unusual among those who become president. (See Clinton, Bill.) But it created complications. Obama believed that he had a  calling,  Garrow writes, and in his case it was  coupled with a heightened awareness that to pursue it he had to fully identify as African American. Obama had considered Donald Trump long before either man won the presidency, and brushed off his existence as a misguided national fantasy. Americans have a  continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility,  Obama wrote in the old Harvard book manuscript, now more than 25 years old.  The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American   I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don t make it, my children will.

She gave a very flimsy excuse for not testifying via her lawyer:Rice considered the invitation a  diversionary play  to distract attention from the investigation into Russian election interference, including contacts between Trump allies and Russians during the campaign, the source said.That s ridiculous! Could it REALLY be that she doesn t want to testify under oath? Ya think!According to CNN, Barack Obama s national security adviser turned down a request from Sen. Lindsey Graham to participate in the hearing. Senator Whitehouse has informed us by letter (SEE BELOW) that he did not agree to Chairman Graham s invitation to Ambassador Rice, a significant departure from the bipartisan invitations extended to other witnesses,  Rice s lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler wrote in a letter to Graham.  Under these circumstances, Ambassador Rice respectfully declines Senator Graham s invitation to testify. Rice was the administration official who made the dozens of requests seeking to unmask the identities of Trump associates, which she said were for national security reasons and not politically motivated Read more: Daily CallerTHE LETTER FROM RICE S LAWYER:Dear Chairman Graham and Ranking Member Whitehouse:I write on behalf of my client, Ambassador Susan E. Rice, in response to Senator Graham s invitation to Ambassador Rice to testify at a May 8, 2017 hearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism entitled  Russian Interference in the 2016 United States Election. While Ambassador Rice commends the Subcommittee s efforts to examine this matter of extraordinary national significance, it is extremely rare for the Congress to request the testimony of a former senior advisor to the President given the longstanding and well-recognized separation of powers concerns at issue. Moreover, Chairman Graham s invitation was extended only after the hearing was noticed, less than two weeks before the hearing was scheduled to occur, and without consultation with Ambassador Rice, a professional courtesy that would customarily be extended to any witness. Notwithstanding the significance of these concerns, Ambassador Rice is prepared to assist Congressional inquiries into Russian election interference because of the important national interests at stake, provided they are conducted in a bipartisan manner, and as appropriate, in classified session.In this case, however, Senator Whitehouse has informed us by letter that he did not agree to Chairman Graham s invitation to Ambassador Rice, a significant departure from the bipartisan invitations extended to other witnesses. Under these circumstances, Ambassador Rice respectfully declines Senator Graham s invitation to testify.Again, and as Ambassador Rice has stated publicly, she supports and is committed to assisting the bipartisan Congressional inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election, given the utmost importance of this matter to our national security.Please contact me if you have any questions.

BOMBSHELL BIOGRAPHY: “SELF-OBSESSED” BARACK OBAMA Asked WHITE Girlfriend To Marry Him…Dated Her While Engaged To Michelle,"The sex secrets of the young Barack Obama have been revealed in an authoritative new biography of the ex-president.The new book by Pulitzer Prize winning author David J. Garrow titled,  Rising  claims that Barack Obama proposed to Sheila Miyoshi Jager before he met MichelleGarrows book is full of bombshells about Barack Obama and the sacrifices he made early onIn a probing new biography,  Rising Star,  David J. Garrow attempts to do all that, but also something more: He tells us how Obama lived, and explores the calculations he made in the decades leading up to his winning the presidency. Garrow portrays Obama as a man who ruthlessly compartmentalized his existence; who believed early on that he was fated for greatness; and who made emotional sacrifices in the pursuit of a goal that must have seemed unlikely to everyone but him. Every step   whether his foray into community organizing, Harvard Law School, even the choice of whom to love   was not just about living a life but about fulfilling a destiny.It is in the personal realm that Garrow s account is particularly revealing. He shares for the first time the story of a woman Obama lived with and loved in Chicago, in the years before he met Michelle, and whom he asked to marry him. Sheila Miyoshi Jager, now a professor at Oberlin College, is a recurring presence in  Rising Star,  and her pained, drawn-out relationship with Obama informs both his will to rise in politics and the trade-offs he deems necessary to do so. Narrow, who received a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Martin Luther King Jr., concludes this massive new work with a damning verdict on Obama s determination:  While the crucible of self-creation had produced an ironclad will, the vessel was hollow at its core.  -The Washington PostObama slept with his girlfriend Genevieve Cook on their first date, before she wrote him a poem about their  f***ing  and called their sex  passionate , the book about the former president reveals.They also took cocaine together   and after they split she slept with his best friend.Obama also considered a gay relationship while at college, twice proposed to another white girlfriend, and cheated on Michelle with his ex during the first year of their relationship. Obama, a new Columbia graduate who was working for a firm that  prepared financial reports at the time, made dinner for Cook at his apartment in Manhattan two weeks after meeting her at a New Year s Eve party and handing her his phone number.It was the start of a relationship which is one of a series revealed in Rising Star.It was written after exhaustive research by Pulitzer-prize winning biographer David Garrow, and also reveals how he asked another woman to marry him   and continued a relationship with her while dating Michelle, before she became his wife.Cook was 25 when she met 22-year-old Obama on New Year s Eve in 1983.Australian-born Cook was living in her mother and stepfather s Park Avenue apartment at the time, but had been brought up around the world, including   like Obama, Indonesia   as her father was an Australian spy and diplomat.But the couple also used drugs and Cook reveals that Obama was still a cocaine user when they were together.He would spend time with other friends   Hasan Chandoo, Imad Hussain and Sohale Siddiqi, who he had been friends with at Occidental College, in Los Angeles   and Cook said the trio was taking  lots of cocaine .They were far more prolific users than Obama, who she said probably preferred staying home to read than taking the drug. Chandoo   who was later to become a fundraiser for Obama   was the leader, the book claims. For every five lines that somebody did, he would have done half,  Cook said.The book also notes that Cook and Obama would smoke pot but only at parties and records one time when during tension in their relationship she wrote in her diary that they went to a party and got  high  on cocaine.That Obama was still using cocaine in his early 20s is a significant revelation.He had previously only disclosed that he used it as a teenage student.The couple split in June 1985, after a year and a half together, the book says.But she was hardly out of his life   because she became involved with his friend Sohale in September of that year.She and Sohale did ecstasy together, and then had sex. When she wrote to Obama and told him he replied:  The news of Sohale and you did hurt. He also used   possibly inadvertently   a racial slur to refer to Sohale and the other two Pakistani-born friends, calling them  the Pakis  in the same letter.",politics,"May 3, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"WATCH SEAN SPICER Slam Hillary With Great Sports Analogy On Election Loss: “Look, I’m a Patriots fan…” [Video]","Sean Spicer gave Hillary Clinton a little dig when he used the analogy of the Falcons vs Patriots game to explain the election last year. You ll love this! It s in response to Clinton s ridiculous claim that the press and Comey were to blame for her loss (see below). She needs to just go away! It s somewhat sad that we re still debating that the president won in the fashion he did Amen to that!The Media Research Center recently published a study showing that 91% of the coverage Donald Trump received during his campaign was considered negative or  hostile .Was it even necessary to prove that almost all of candidate Trump s media coverage was negative or  hostile  compared to Hillary Clinton s?  For the most part, the media mocked anyone who even suggested Hillary had a part in the Benghazi attack that took the lives of 4 innocent Americans. They ignored and even laughed at the brave victims who came forward and publicly accused Hillary of  enabling  her sexual predator husband, while referring to her as a  champion of women and girls . The media did everything in their power to push Hillary s email scandal to the bottom of the news pile, but were finally forced to address it when FBI Director James Comey came forward and announced his investigation into her unsecured email server that was being used for official State Department business.After several months of keeping a pretty low profile, Hillary is coming out with excuses about why she lost the election. The timing is a bit suspicious however after an inside account of Hillary s disastrous campaign was just released by an insider who wrote a tell-all book titled  Shattered  that offers a less than charitable view of the real Hillary Clinton.Watch Hillary in her latest video, as she hilariously blames the press for losing the election:Here s the second part of Hillary s appearance where she tells the crowd she was on her  way to victory  until FBI Director James Comey ruined it for her:Politico   In addition to receiving far more network coverage, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump, such as his treatment of women, than controversies surrounding Clinton, such as her email practices or the Clinton Foundation.For the study, MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). Of the total newscasts, the networks devoted 29 percent of their time to the campaign. The study did not include comments from the campaigns or candidates themselves, instead focusing on what the correspondents, anchors, expert commentators, and voters on the street said in order to try and hone in on any sort of slant from the networks.Though neither candidate was necessarily celebrated, Clinton largely just stayed out of the line of fire. Even when they were critical of Hillary Clinton   for concealing her pneumonia, for example, or mischaracterizing the FBI investigation of her e-mail server   network reporters always maintained a respectful tone in their coverage,  the study found.  This was not the case with Trump, who was slammed as embodying  the politics of fear,  or a  dangerous  and  vulgar   misogynistic bully  who had insulted vast swaths of the American electorate. It doesn t really surprise me, I think most people got the sense that this was a hostile place for Trump, the establishment media,  said Rich Noyes, director of research for the MRC.  I would say looking at the big picture, the Trump campaign and to a lesser extent Republicans in general wanted this to be a referendum on Obama   the Clinton campaign, the Democrats, once Trump was picked wanted this be a referendum on Donald Trump. Television news has for the past 12 weeks has been giving the Democrats the campaign they wanted.

Lately, she s getting attention for being the love of Wikileaks Julian Assange. That s why it s interesting that she s now somewhat of a fan of Melania Trump. It s interesting that Anderson praised Melania for not wearing fur to the inauguration because the First Lady has been pictured many times wearing fur. An unlikely cause or has Melania gone anti-fur? It is heartwarming to see you manage your position with such beauty and grace   Pamela AndersonOn Wednesday, the Baywatch alum shared a letter she received from the first lady.  Dear Melania, Thank you for your sweet note,  Anderson tweeted alongside an image of the letter.  It is heartwarming to see you manage your position with such beauty and grace. The note from Melania Trump thanked Anderson for sending a  beautiful eco-faux fur  from Russian faux-fur manufacturer Only Me. Melania Trump s letter concluded,  I am grateful for your support and encouraging words; they mean a great deal. Together, we can empower more women to stand up for their beliefs. Anderson sent the gift to FLOTUS in February, with a note that read,  Amid all the mania at the inauguration, you looked stunning in an outfit by Ralph Lauren   one of many fur-free designers. I am so happy that you chose not to wear fur! As first lady, you will help set style trends, and by remaining compassionate with your choices, you will warm the hearts of many. Anderson has been a longtime animal rights activist and member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). In July 2015, she wrote an open letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin asking him to save endangered fin whales.This is an interesting choice for a common cause since Melania Trump has been pictured in many beautiful furs over the years.

WIFE OF BRITISH MEDIC Calls Radio Show…Says Husband Processed Migrants With “ISIS Stuff” On Phones…Men Push Women And Children To Back Of Line For Treatment [VIDEO],"A caller to British radio host Katie Hopkins whose name is Jessica, called into Katie s show to relay a story to her about her formerly  bleeding heart liberal  husband who has come to have a  hatred of a certain demographic  after helping migrants who are arriving in migrant rescue boats. Jessica told Hopkins,  My husband is turning into a man I don t recognize anymore because of what he has physically seen. Jessica added that it was the way male migrants behaved in particular, that led to his change of heart.She told Katie:  It was a really, really traumatic time for him. He was doing three-week stints and they were picking bodies out of the sea. Babies, women, it was awful. But at the same time, he said they were processing men, adults, in their 30s who all had phones with Isis stuff on the phones, they were being separated. When they were being handed over to the authorities with the information explaining that these guys had all this on their phones, and what their ages were, and they were just being processed through. There was nothing, they were just being separated out, they just all went through with everything else, it broke his heart, because he was dealing with families who were in such a terrible state with young babies who so clearly needed rescuing. And yet you had adult males that were pushing women and children to the back of the queue they felt that they were more important. It s just an awful situation, and this was last year. He can t handle the way these women and children are treated by these men. There were hundreds and hundreds of women, children, men who were being picked out of the sea. Not all of them were refugees. He came home heartbroken. Absolutely heartbroken, because he s saying  I don t know how Europe is going to cope .She continued:  How are we supposed to process that as individuals? You know, he still has images that he has to deal with over a year later. We forget about the medics who deal with this, the soldiers that are dealing with this. The people that are processing these people. It s not just how are we going to process all these people, but how are we going to deal with the trauma of having to process these people? Having to make these decisions? Who do you treat first? A special thank you to Paul Joseph Watson for this video: Man who helped rescue  refugees  said many were men with ISIS content on phones who shoved women & children out of the way. pic.twitter.com/wH08TLf4xY  Paul Joseph Watson  (@PrisonPlanet) May 3, 2017Katie asked the caller how her husband is doing currently after seeing the vast number of migrants rescued this year already.Jessica said:  My husband is turning into, it s why I stopped him doing it, he s turning into a man I don t recognise anymore. Because my family think I m a bleeding heart liberal, and you know, I would just wave everyone in and say  come on, we ll help , and my husband was of a very similar opinion that people needed help. He s now turning into someone I don t recognise, because of what he has physically seen. He is starting to say this is not all people looking for help, there are people here who are out for their own self interest. She added:  It s just awful. And now he is building a hatred of a certain demograph[ic], that he has been exposed to because he s seen the way they behave.   LBCIs it too late for Europe? Have they allowed this unabated invasion of migrants from majority Muslim nations to their once  culturally distinct nations for too long? What will these bleeding heart nations look like in 5 years? How long will Americans sit back and allow bleeding heart liberals to call them  racists  or  xenophobes  because they don t want to see the fundamental transformation of the United States that Barack Obama promised would happen if we elected him as our president.

IRAN MAKES MAJOR Announcement About How They Plan To Use BILLIONS In “OBAMA-BUCK$” [VIDEO],"Iran is using the billions in cash resources provided under the landmark nuclear deal to engage in an unprecedented military buildup meant to transform the Islamic Republic s fighting force into an  offensive  juggernaut, according to a largely unreported announcement by Iranian military leaders that has sparked concern among U.S. national security insiders and sources on Capitol Hill.The shocking truth behind the US-Iran nuclear deal, as WSJ reports, is that John Kerry and the Obama Administration airlifted $1.7bn of cash in  compromise  payments (read   bribe) to Tehran to ensure the release of 4 captured sailors coincidentally the same weekend as the signing of the nuclear deal.Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said.Of course, senior U.S. officials denied any link between the payment and the prisoner exchange. They say the way the various strands came together simultaneously was coincidental, not the result of any quid pro quo.  Zero HedgeIt now appears that Obama s chickens are coming home to roost Iranian officials announced late last month that Iran s defense budget had increased by 145 percent under President Hassan Rouhani and that the military is moving forward with a massive restructuring effort aimed at making it  a forward moving force,  according to regional reports.Iranian leaders have stated since the Iran deal was enacted that they are using the massive amounts of cash released under the agreement to fund the purchase of new military equipment and other armaments. Iran also has pursued multi-million dollar arms deals with Russia since economic sanctions were nixed as part of the deal.Leading members of Congress and U.S. officials working on the Iran portfolio suspect that at least a portion of the Obama administration s $1.7 billion cash payment to Iran  has been used to fund and support terrorists in the Middle East.The latest disclosure about Iran s military buildup is further fueling concerns that U.S. cash assets returned to the country which were released with no strings attached by the Obama administration are helping Iran pursue a more aggressive military stance against U.S. forces in the region. President Obama flat-out caved in to Iran when he handed them the disastrous nuclear deal and $1.7 billion in cash payments that could assist Iran s military,  Rep. Sean Duffy (R., Wis.), an opponent of the nuclear deal, told the Washington Free Beacon.  So it s no surprise that the world s lead sponsor of terrorism would feel emboldened to become more aggressive in the region and flex its military muscle. Iranian Brigadier General Kiumars Heidari announced the military buildup during Iran s annual Army Day. While the announcement did not grab many headlines in the Western media, national security insiders have been discussing the announcement for weeks, according to conversations with multiple sources.Iran s goal is to turn its army into an  offensive  force, a major shift from its historic role as a support agent for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, or IRGC, Iran s extremely well funded primary fighting force.For entire story: Washington Free Beacon",politics,"May 3, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
"WATCH TUCKER CARLSON’S Heated Debate With Delusional Illegal Activist: “I am here illegally . . . But I, as a person, am not illegal.” [Video]","Tucker Carlson interviews Jose Antonio Vargas, CEO of Define America He gave Vargas a reality check!Vargas takes offense to the way Carlson is framing this? It s difficult for this illegal to face reality.He says,  I was an undocumented immigrant in this country  yet he doesn t think he s illegal.Vargas:  My protest yesterday was as an undocumented immigrant, one of 11 million who are viewed as criminals,  let s pause here for a moment . . . that is one illegal immigrant too many and you ARE criminals . . . now we ll continue,  my own way of protesting was just   actually   very quietly and respectfully thinking about what it means to be an immigrant in the Trump era, right?

I m not accusing you of setting fires, I m merely saying: where are people who agree with these folks standing up and saying  you re not allowed to do this, you can t block traffic, you can t break things, you can t set fires , it  pretty simple.

Proposed Budget Deal Is MUCH WORSE On U.S. Border Security Than We Originally Thought,"Only a few days after his inauguration, President Donald Trump moved aggressively to tighten the nation s immigration policies Wednesday, signing executive actions to jumpstart construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall and block federal grants from immigrant-protecting  sanctuary cities. Beginning today the United States of America gets back control of its borders,  Trump declared during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security.  We are going to save lives on both sides of the border. Trump cast his actions as fulfillment of a campaign pledge to enact hard-line immigration measures, including construction of a wall paid for by Mexico. With the families of Americans killed by people living in the U.S. illegally sitting in the audience, Trump said,  When it comes to public safety, there is no place for politics. Trump cast his actions as fulfillment of a campaign pledge to enact hard-line immigration measures, including construction of a wall paid for by Mexico. With the families of Americans killed by people living in the U.S. illegally sitting in the audience, Trump said,  When it comes to public safety, there is no place for politics.   PBSAlthough the source of funding for a border wall was never really clear, most Americans believed with a Republican majority in both the House and Senate, funding for a secure border wall, as part of our national security was a no-brainer. Conservative Review   The proposed budget deal before the House of Representatives is playing out like a bad replay of the latter Obama era: A Republican-controlled Congress   given the power of the purse by the American people   giving away the farm to Democrat demands.But the capitulation is far worse than one may realize. It s not just the lack of new funding for a southern border wall; this omnibus, which funds countless liberal priorities, prohibits existing funds from being used on any sort of border wall as well.According to a Congressional Research Service report from January, the Department of Homeland Security could have taken non-obligated funds and used them to put structures along areas of the border already spelled out in the Secure Fence Act of 2006 mandating a double-layered fence. Indeed, nothing in current law would appear to bar DHS from installing hundreds of miles of additional physical barriers,  it contends,  at least so long as this action was determined appropriate to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry or was deemed warranted to achieve  operational control  of the southern border. It s important to remember that the requirement to construct  no less than 700 miles  of border fencing (originally 850 miles) has been the law on the books for over a decade. Obama used waiver authority and very loose discretion (thanks to the weakening of the law in 2008) to skirt the requirement.Now that Trump wants to fulfill the existing mandate, Congress really has a moral obligation to honor the existing statutory authorization with sufficient appropriations. This is not some Trump boondoggle; this is a law passed with major bipartisan support in 2006.What the current proposal does is not only not fund a border wall, but it s so specifically worded as to prohibit any of the currently allocated funds from going to construction on the project. The bill actually rescinds $21 million in unobligated funds for border fencing.This means that even previous resources cannot be used on new construction as well, thereby tying the administration s hands and essentially weakening current law. Without this language, Trump could theoretically begin entering into contracts so that by the time the September funding bill is signed, he can hit the ground running with new funding (not that he will fight then, either). So, rather than take what money exists and use that to start negotiating contracts, run studies, and do whatever else is conceivable on physical border security between now and when Congress revisits this never-ending budget circus in September, nothing except for maintenance on the current, insufficient structure will be permitted.Meanwhile, the current budget retains provisions either providing funds specifically for, or predicating them upon, border security in countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Pakistan, Libya, Ethiopia, and other countries  affected by extremism. That is not to say that the security of these borders against the likes of jihadists aren t our concern, or that these provisions ought not to exist. Assisting in physically stopping the flow of terrorist arms and personnel across borders is but one basic tool to be employed in the global fight against Sharia supremacism. But the juxtaposition of these is telling.A Republican Congress is willing to pass a bill that realizes border security is necessary for countries across the ocean, but will sacrifice not only a symbol of our own sovereignty, but a physical means of protecting it (the only effective way of tackling the policy and political problems with open borders).

We re happy she mentioned the ***Refugee Resettlement Program because that s one part of the bill that we re very disappointed in. The Refugee Resettlement Program is so bloated and needs to be overhauled or defunded altogether. We re sick about it:The bill would include a total of $3 billion towards migration and refugee assistance, which is roughly the same that was spent in Fiscal Year 2016. It would also include $50 million towards the emergency refugee and migration assistance fund, which is also the same amount spent in the previous fiscal year.

BLACK STUDENT With Hot Glue Gun Causes Elite LIBERAL COLLEGE To Lock-Down Campus,"After a sighting of black student with a hot glue gun caused the tolerant, liberal campus of Colgate quickly jumped into action and locked down the school. The university president took swift action, blamed the Campus Safety Director and quickly placed him on administrative leave until an investigation is completed. There have been no shots fired Colgate University locked down its campus today, after a student spotted an  armed individual  who was actually holding a hot glue gun.The upstate New York university s official Twitter account tweeted out a warning late Monday urging students to seek shelter. The tweets warned there was an  armed person  on campus, although there were  no reports of shots fired. But shortly before midnight, the lockdown was lifted. In a statement to students, Colgate announced that  after thorough investigation, and with the assistance of the person in question, law enforcement identified the individual as a student who was using a glue gun for an art project. Students on social media quickly reported that the glue-toting student was African-American, and grumbled that race may have played a factor. In an additional statement Tuesday morning, Colgate President Brian W. Casey confirmed the student s race and apologized.  WFBColgate Alert: Because of a dangerous situation in the Coop, everyone is advised to leave the building.  Colgate University (@colgateuniv) May 2, 2017Colgate Alert: There is an armed person at the Coop. Find a safe space and remain indoors. If you are off-campus,stay away.  Colgate University (@colgateuniv) May 2, 2017Law enforcement is on campus for reports of an alleged armed person in the Coop. They are searching the building.  Colgate University (@colgateuniv) May 2, 2017Campus safety officials report there have been no shots fired. Situation is still under investigation. Updates as available.  Colgate University (@colgateuniv) May 2, 2017Colgate University President made the following statement: This morning I received an update from Campus Safety regarding the events of last night, details of which I want to share with the campus. Please know that I have called for a thorough, deeper review of all matters related to last night from the original reporting of the events to the University s response. I will have this report within ten days and I will share its findings with the campus.At a few minutes before 8 PM last night a Colgate student called Colgate Campus Safety reporting that they had seen a black male entering the Coop, carrying what appeared to be a gun. A few minutes later, Campus Safety sent out the first of two campus announcements, the first identifying an  Emergency Situation  and the second indicating, in a profound error, that there was an active shooter on the campus. (The remaining campus notices last night were sent out by our Communications Office and an emergency response team.)After the initial report, Campus Safety contacted local law enforcement units, which proceeded to engage in steps associated with reports of a person with a gun in a public setting. Only after it was determined that the person in the Coop was a Colgate student who had a glue gun needed for an art project was Campus Safety able to end the campus lockdown.To more fully understand the events of last night, we are in contact with the student who had the glue gun and will be with the student who made the initial report. Importantly, I am also in contact with those who were making the essential administrative decisions last night.It is important that we understand the role that implicit racial bias had in the initial reporting of and responses to the events of last night. I want to make sure we speak with those who made and received the initial report to understand the role this played.More egregiously, perhaps, was the effect profiling had on the response of safety officers and other University offices to these events. In addition, communication and enforcement steps were taken that, I believe, confused and harmed this campus and our students. As a first step, I have asked Campus Safety Director Bill Ferguson, who was leading university security efforts last night, to take an administrative leave from his position effective immediately while we conduct a review of the events of last night.This has been a difficult, painful several hours on this campus. My obligation is, first, to demand a full accounting of what happened. My next obligation is to take steps to ensure the safety of all Colgate students, faculty and staff. My final obligation my desire is to improve Colgate. If there is anything that can and should come from these events it must be that concrete steps are taken to make Colgate a better place, and a university worthy of both regard and respect.

CUBANS BRUTALLY ATTACK Brave Man Waving US Flag In Front Of Communist Parade [Video],"This is what having no freedom of speech looks like This guy is awesome! I use whatever flag I want because I am free. I am not a hypocrite, not like all the Cubans marching yesterday [the 2016 May Day march]   all those Cubans are hypocrites,  he told his detractors. He went on to praise the U.S. flag as the  pride of the Americans  and assert,  I don t fear the government. Daniel Llorente is the brave pro-American Cuban dissident who interrupted Monday s May Day parade in Havana, running in front of the marching throngs waving an American flag. A communist mob attacked him, beating him and dragging him away.The man, identified as Daniel Llorente, has previously waged similar protests against the communist regime of dictator Ra l Castro and has expressed vocally his support for the American government.Video of the incident shows that Llorente took off running in front of the throngs, waving an American flag before the likeness of mass murderer Ernesto  Che  Guevara in the Plaza of the Revolution, waiting to march just moments before the May Day parade was to begin, shouting anti-government slogans. A group of men waiting on the sidelines, who have not been identified in reports, restrained, beat, and dragged Llorente away. Every major Cuban government leader, including dictator Castro, was in attendance.The Miami-based outlet Mart  Noticias identified the man as Llorente, a freelance cab driver and dissident, but does not belong to any dissident organizations. Instead, he has used his American flag to protest on previous occasions by waving it before public congregations. A year ago, Llorente protested before a crowd awaiting the first American cruise ship s arrival in Havana, the Adonia. Llorente greeted the ship waving an American flag and shouting  Yes we can! , the famous slogan of President Barack Obama s first presidential campaign. The government organized a rabble to berate Llorente with racial epithets, and Llorente responded by asserting his freedom.Read more: Breitbart",politics,"May 2, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
HILLARY GIVES HILARIOUS Reason For Losing Election: “I Was On The Way To Winning” [VIDEO],"The Media Research Center recently published a study showing that 91% of the coverage Donald Trump received during his campaign was considered negative or  hostile .Was it even necessary to prove that almost all of candidate Trump s media coverage was negative or  hostile  compared to Hillary Clinton s?  For the most part, the media mocked anyone who even suggested Hillary had a part in the Benghazi attack that took the lives of 4 innocent Americans. They ignored and even laughed at the brave victims who came forward and publicly accused Hillary of  enabling  her sexual predator husband, while referring to her as a  champion of women and girls . The media did everything in their power to push Hillary s email scandal to the bottom of the news pile, but were finally forced to address it when FBI Director James Comey came forward and announced his investigation into her unsecured email server that was being used for official State Department business.After several months of keeping a pretty low profile, Hillary is coming out with excuses about why she lost the election. The timing is a bit suspicious however after an inside account of Hillary s disastrous campaign was just released by an insider who wrote a tell-all book titled  Shattered  that offers a less than charitable view of the real Hillary Clinton.Watch Hillary in her latest video, as she hilariously blames the press for losing the election:Here s the second part of Hillary s appearance where she tells the crowd she was on her  way to victory  until FBI Director James Comey ruined it for her:Politico   In addition to receiving far more network coverage, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump, such as his treatment of women, than controversies surrounding Clinton, such as her email practices or the Clinton Foundation.For the study, MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). Of the total newscasts, the networks devoted 29 percent of their time to the campaign. The study did not include comments from the campaigns or candidates themselves, instead focusing on what the correspondents, anchors, expert commentators, and voters on the street said in order to try and hone in on any sort of slant from the networks.Though neither candidate was necessarily celebrated, Clinton largely just stayed out of the line of fire. Even when they were critical of Hillary Clinton   for concealing her pneumonia, for example, or mischaracterizing the FBI investigation of her e-mail server   network reporters always maintained a respectful tone in their coverage,  the study found.  This was not the case with Trump, who was slammed as embodying  the politics of fear,  or a  dangerous  and  vulgar   misogynistic bully  who had insulted vast swaths of the American electorate. It doesn t really surprise me, I think most people got the sense that this was a hostile place for Trump, the establishment media,  said Rich Noyes, director of research for the MRC.  I would say looking at the big picture, the Trump campaign and to a lesser extent Republicans in general wanted this to be a referendum on Obama   the Clinton campaign, the Democrats, once Trump was picked wanted this be a referendum on Donald Trump. Television news has for the past 12 weeks has been giving the Democrats the campaign they wanted.

HOW PAUL RYAN JUST Made A Mockery Of Trump’s Promise To Protect Blue-Collar Jobs From Foreign Workers,"The bipartisan congressional language creates a headache for Trump and his deputies because it flips the politically difficult problem from Congress to the Department of Homeland Security of deciding whether to provide extra wage-cutting H-2B contract workers to companies or else to improve job opportunities for Trump s blue-collar voters.The new rule helps business groups offset rising pressure for wage increases, just 18 months before the mid-term elections when voters will vet the success or not of Trump s  Buy American, Hire American  policies.The H-2B language was hidden deep in the draft 2017 supplemental budget   which is to face House and Senate votes this week   and it surprised opponents of the legislation. In December 2016, Ryan had agreed to trim the program when the partial 2017 budget deal was announced just one month after blue-collar voters backed Donald Trump s campaign promise of a low-immigration, high-wage national economic policy.Apparently nothing is going to change, as long as Speaker Ryan remains at the helm. Watch: Immigration expert Mark Krikorian tweeted aboutHere's the text of the #H2B ""returning workers"" loophole that makes a mockery of the law's numerical ""limits"". https://t.co/G7dc1Qpmaz pic.twitter.com/Hf4UPjwJB4  Mark Krikorian (@MarkSKrikorian) May 1, 2017The language in the 2017 budget says the Department of Homeland Security has the authority to exceed the supposed 66,000 annual cap on H-2B outsourcing visas by a number equal to the maximum number of workers who benefited from an earlier exemption, dubbed the  returning worker exemption.

EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HEAR THIS: Radical Democrat Chair Openly Reveals The Shocking Agenda Of The Democrat Party During May Day Speech [Video],"Tom Perez decided to go there yesterday when he said during his May Day speech that  no human being is illegal .So now the Democrats are coming out with the truth they are openly advocating for open borders. Pretty unbelievable, huh? They used to at least attempt to hide the fact that they are for open borders, but now it s out in the open. Could it be that the Dem Chariman Tom Perez is connected to the pro-open borders radical group La Raza?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFoLUXm3gQoTom Perez has been going around spouting profanity against the Republicans in a new effort to try and win votes we think this is great for the Republicans. Who wants to hear profanity laden speeches?One of the latest speeches with profanity showed a young kid right next to Perez during the speech! Who does that?Perez refused to say President Trump s name: Our most important power is not the mister in the White House, I can t even mention his name, the power is with all of you He then claimed that no one is illegal: No human being is illegal, we must treat everyone with dignity DNC Chair Tom Perez was on MSNBC (video below) to answer to critics who didn t like his nasty speech:He appeared at an event held by New Jersey Working Families Alliance, a re-branded ACORN agency and gave a hateful and divisive speech. He claimed that, Republicans don t give a sh*t about people . Why the Democrats picked this far left radical is puzzling unless the Democrats plan on going full commie Perez is connected to the radical open borders group La Raza. Something tells us that Obama made this pick for the Democrats.Check out a defiant Perez doubling down on is nastiness:OUR PREVIOUS REPORT BELOW:Newly elected Democrat Chair Tom Perez went a little bonkers with a rant on how he wants the Dems to think Trump didn t win the election. The Democrats are trying to discredit Trump at every turn but they re losing. The American people want good policy and NOT political turmoil. That s exactly why Trump won! People are sick to death of this type of outright lying to sway people to your side.Perez has a long radical history connected to La Raza and other open borders organizations. His track record  is full on radical. e s in cahoots with Obama to continue the  fundamental transformation  of America. Anyone who s a Democrat should be shocked that he s taking the party in such a far left direction. Do your research and you ll know why he was the choice for Dem Chair.He just fired all Democrat Party staffers and is bringing in all new people. The party is clearly taking a new direction and it s not a good one for any American.

BREAKING: PAUL RYAN Nervously Giggles During Budget Speech That DOESN’T Fund A Border Wall [Video],"Paul Ryan nervously giggled during the Republican announcement of the budget and Obamacare replacement this morning. It s interesting to watch all of the Republicans in the video below skip over the elephant in the room by redirecting everyone to other items THEY consider to be positive. Ryan emphasized the funding for border patrol but skipped right over the border wall funding.Why does the left bother with  Resistance  theatrics when the Republican Congress funds their entire wish list anyway?Is funding the NIH (National Institutes for Health) with 2 BILLION dollars a good thing? That bloated and very wasteful item needs to be looked at more closely. Remember shrimp on a treadmill? Drunk monkeys? Yes, this is the organization that gives out YOUR tax dollars to people to do crazy experiments that are honestly wasteful.The other things like funding Sanctuary Cities? Is anyone else puzzled by this?Why are the Republicans constantly trying to appease the Democrats?Please skip to the 5:15 mark in the video:This is a loser spending bill for the American people!",politics,"May 2, 2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
