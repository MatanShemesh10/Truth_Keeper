And this newspaper proves it.Sadly, Donald Trump s inauguration is on Friday and it is likely going to be an event that offends millions of Americans across the country as Trump makes the day all about him and attacking his critics.Trump s team has been desperate to find musical talent willing to sell their souls to Satan to sing for Trump and have only managed to get a reality show singer and a has-been band to commit.Furthermore, a massive protest against Trump has also been planned to occur at the same time. All in all, Trump s inauguration is going to be a shit show that ushers in a frightening period in American history that will impact this nation for generations as Republicans try to turn it into their own utopia where rich people and tyrants flourish while the rest of humanity suffers immeasurably.All the progress made over the last 150 years is about to go down the drain and one Scottish newspaper could only describe Trump s inauguration as the return of  The Twilight Zone. The Sunday Herald describes this newest  Twilight Zone  episode as  one of the most ambitious, expensive and controversial productions in broadcast history  featuring four years of answers to the question of what would have happened if the Nazis had won World War II.Calling the event  nightmarish,  the Sunday Herald goes on to say that Americans were unbelievably duped to make Donald Trump president. This huge virtual reality project, which will unfold on TV, in the press, and on Twitter over the next four years sets out to build on an alternative present. The story begins in a nightmarish version of 2017 in which huge sections of the US electorate have somehow been duped into voting to make Donald Trump president. It sounds far-fetched, and it is,  the description continues,  but as it goes on it becomes more and more chillingly plausible. Today s feature length opener concentrates on the gaudy inauguration of President Trump, and the stirrings of protest and despair surrounding the ceremony It s a flawed piece, but a disturbing glimpse of the horrors we could stumble into, if we re not careful.

On ABC s  This Week with George Steephanopoulos,  Preibus laid down a straight out of Russia threat on the director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub.

So I m not sure what this person at government ethics, what sort of standing he has any more in giving these opinions. Here s the video:This is all because Shaub dared have an opinion that isn t necessarily favorable to the incoming Dictator in Chief. Actually, the opinion was barely political at all. Shaub simply said that Trump just  stepping back from running his business is meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective.  Instead, Shaub urged Trump to put his assets in a blind trust, as has become customary.While Shaub may have been a Hillary Clinton supporter (there s no evidence to say that), it was clear by his statement that he was simply doing his job, which is to oversee the ethics (or, in this case, lack thereof) of government officials.

In almost 30 years of practicing law in this town, I would say Mr. von Keyserling is the one person I would never suspect of having any inappropriate sexual predilections,  Russell claimed.  There was a playful gesture, in front of witnesses. It was too trivial to be considered anything of significance. To call it a sexual assault is not based in reality. Let s make this clear. Keyserling s attorney is literally saying that grabbing a woman by the genitals is not sexual assault, but simply a trivial playful gesture that women should find flattering.This, ladies and gentlemen, is how rape culture continues to be a plague in our country.

In a DNC fundraising email that was released last night, Lewis addressed Trump s ill-advised comments: Today Donald Trump attacked me on Twitter. He said that I m  all talk  and  no action.

Ever since the memos compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele were released to the public, The Donald has not exactly had an easy time of things, with every press conference and attempt to tweet quickly devolving into a screaming mess in which Trump throws himself into a panic screaming of all-caps typing the words  FAKE NEWS. But while Trump is taking the  nothing to see here  approach with the reports, at least four sources now back the information according to a report from BBC s Paul Wood earlier this week: The former MI6 agent is not the only source for the claim about Russian kompromat on the president-elect. Back in August, a retired spy told me he had been informed of its existence by  the head of an East European intelligence agency,  Wood says, explaining that he used an intermediary to check into things. A U.S. intelligence contact told him that there was  more than one  tape, and that video and audio of Trump s exploits in Moscow and St. Petersberg do exist.According to Israeli news publication Yedioth Ahronoth, their country s spies have been warned by the United States against sharing information with the Trump administration until they can determine whether he has been compromised by Putin:These fears, which began upon Trump s election, grew stronger following a meeting held recently between Israeli and American intelligence officials (the date of the meeting is not mentioned to protect the sources of the report). During the meeting, according to the Israelis who participated in it, their American colleagues voiced despair over Trump s election, as he often lashes out at the American intelligence community. The American officials also told the Israelis that the National Security Agency (NSA) had  highly credible information  that Russia s intelligence agencies, the FSB and GRU, were responsible for hacking the Democratic Party (DNC) servers during the elections and leaking sensitive information to WikiLeaks, which hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.The American officials further added that they believed Russia President Vladimir Putin had  leverages of pressure  over Trump   but did not elaborate. They were apparently referring to what was published Wednesday about embarrassing information collected by the Russian intelligence in a bid to blackmail the president-elect.The Americans implied that their Israeli colleagues should  be careful  as of January 20, Trump s inauguration date, when transferring intelligence information to the White House and to the National Security Council (NSC), which is subject to the president. According to the Israelis who were present in the meeting, the Americans recommended that until it is made clear that Trump is not inappropriately connected to Russia and is not being extorted   Israel should avoid revealing sensitive sources to administration officials for fear the information would reach the Iranians.If Israel s secrets are indeed not kept confidential, this is a serious danger to the state s national security: Since the early 2000s, the cooperation between the Israel and US intelligence communities has been intensified. It was led by the head of the Israeli Military Intelligence Directorate (AMAN) at the time, Aharon Ze evi Farkash (who even received a citation from the NSA Chief General Michael Hayden), late Mossad chief Meir Dagan and his successor, Tamir Pardo, who served earlier as the commander of one of the secret operational units that cooperated with the Americans. The Israelis who attended the meeting said that the Americans advised them not to expose any sensitive sources to members of the Trump administration, lest that information reach Iranian hands, until it becomes clear that Trump does not have a compromised relationship with Russia and is not vulnerable to extortion,  the report states.At this point, we have no choice but to assume that the level of concern shown by intelligence agencies worldwide is a strong indicator that we should be concerned too.

John Lewis (D-GA) just two days before Martin Luther King Day.It all started because Lewis said what many Americans were thinking when he stated, I don t believe Donald Trump is a legitimate president , and Trump couldn t hold back his little orange fingers and gigantic temper tantrum. He tweeted: Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results.

Unfortunately, his moronic supporters are defending him   one of them being CNN conservative political commentator and radio host Ben Ferguson, who bashed Lewis  comments and called them  unprecedented.  Ferguson said: I can t imagine the fallout, the backfire that you would have if a Republican ever implied that about Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or JFK or anyone else for that matter. Anyone in their right mind not only knows that Lewis is right, but that Trump is a moron for criticizing the civil rights hero. CNN host Poppy Harlow was having none of it, and she immediately tore into Ferguson and the Republican party for complaining about the same things they did to President Barack Obama for the past 8 years.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Georgia Congressman and civil rights hero John Lewis said on Friday that Donald Trump  is not a legitimate president.  Naturally, Trump attacked him on Twitter for stating what millions of Americans already think. But film legend Michael Moore agrees with Lewis wholeheartedly.On Saturday, Moore took to Facebook to give six reasons that Lewis is right and Trump is illegitimate. He began by pointing out that Trump didn t even come close to winning the popular vote.1. Nothing, including an arcane, racist section of the constitution, can change the fact that 3 million more Americans voted for Hillary than for Trump. It s either a democracy or it isn t. If he had won by 3 million, I would sadly admit that Trump is the President the American people wanted. But that s not what happened.Next, Moore said what many people (including my mother who worked in mental health care for several decades) have been saying for months: Trump is f*cking nuts. Not like,  ha ha, he s crazy.  But as in  this is no laughing matter, the man is seriously suffering from a mental illness. 2. He is not well and needs help. He has a number of serious mental disorders that make him unfit to hold office   and they are on display every day in one cringe-worthy tweet after another. He is a full-blown malignant narcissist. He displays sociopathic tendencies. He will say one thing and 30 seconds later say the opposite. He is disconnected from the truth. And he has a stunning lack of human empathy. These behaviors make him a truly dangerous occupant of the Oval Office.The third item on Moore s list is obvious to anyone who has been paying attention even a little bit, Russia. It is undeniable at this point that the Russians interfered in the U.S. presidential election and clearly helped land Trump s orange derriere in the White House.3. The Russians interfered with the election in order to get him elected. Even Trump now admits as much. That alone makes the election tainted and should be voided. We spend trillions on ridiculous weapons and ineffective police state-style homeland security measures to defend us against those who would  destroy our way of life    but we are to remain silent when a foreign government is caught trying to get THEIR candidate elected as OUR president? AND they succeed! This is a joke of monstrous proportions   and the fact that conservatives, Republicans and patriotic good ol  boys are actively defending this foreign aggression into our country confirms to me what I ve feared all along: that they really hate our form of democracy, our Bill of Rights, our belief that  All men (sic) are created equal,  our one person-one vote system, that whoever scores the most points wins and that people of all religions are welcome here. They don t believe that, and I d respect them so much more if they would just simply admit it.Moore then slammed FBI Director James Comey for his decision to announce that the investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails was being reopened just days before the presidential election. This all turned out to be bullsh*t by the way but still ended up being the straw that broke the camel s back and swung support away from Clinton in the final stretch.4. The FBI clearly chose sides, and FBI Director Comey s interference in the 10 days before the election most-definitely helped tipped the balance to the FBI s preferred candidate, Donald J. Trump. That our own federal police would so brazenly attempt to throw the election to the person with the least votes is mind-boggling, frightening and must be stopped. Attorney General Lynch must immediately, today, appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate what to me appears to be a criminal offense. If this is true, I want to see FBI Director Comey in handcuffs and behind bars. Short of murder and a few other heinous acts, is there a worse crime in our democracy than the highest ranking cop in the land attempting to throw the election?Moore continued by noting that Trump has appointed billionaires to serve in his cabinet who will be all too happy to sell the U.S. to the highest bidder. In particular, he took issue with the nomination of Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson to serve as secretary of state.5. Trump has nominated in Rex Tillerson the most powerful corporate CEO in the world as  our  Secretary of State. Why would the quarter-billionaire head of the world s richest corporation want a  government job?  So that he, a personal friend of Putin s, can get the US sanctions lifted off Russia so that his company, ExxonMobil, can get back to their exclusive oil deal with Russia   which will eventually net ExxonMobil three TRILLION dollars. This is nothing less than a bold, audacious robbery in broad daylight   and it says a lot about you and me that they think they can get away with it.Finally, Moore said that Trump s legal woes alone should have ruled him out as a presidential possibility. From rape to fraud, Trump has faced a long list of felonies over the years. Not to mention whatever it is in his taxes that he his so desperate to keep secret and his myriad conflicts of interest. How he has made it this far is mind boggling.6. Trump has potentially committed a number of felonies   and a felon simply can t sit in the Oval Office (I can t believe I even have to state that). From his admitted sexual assaults to whatever he s hiding in the tax returns, to possibly evading taxes, to his committing fraud with Trump U, to his long list of conflicts of interest   the chance of us having to suffer through his impeachment trial in the Senate is just too much to bear.Moore concluded by once again stating that Lewis was spot on and urging the public to contact their congressmen to ask them to follow Lewis  lead and refuse to attend the inauguration of an illegitimate president.Featured image via Jemal Countess/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Steele then reminded Trump that if he really wants to heal wounds and bridge divides that he needs to include African-Americans. Instead, Trump just widened that divide by attacking a civil rights legend. If you re looking to heal and bridge, and bring people of America together, well, we re a part of that. As black folks, we re apart of that. Our expectation is, not only will you attempt that same effort that you would to white folks in other communities, but that you will show respect for our leadership, those who do represent our interests.

Bob Thorpe and Mark Finchem, seeks to:15-112. Prohibited courses, classes, events and activities; enforcement; exceptions   A.  A school district or charter school in this state shall not include in its program of instruction any courses, or classes, EVENTS OR ACTIVITIES that include DO any of the following:And if the schools don t comply with the law (intentionally or unintentionally)? They lose 10 percent of their already depleted funds:B.   If the state board of education or the superintendent of public instruction determines that the school district or charter school has failed to comply with subsection A OF THIS SECTION within sixty days after a notice has been issued pursuant to this subsection, the state board of education or the superintendent of public instruction may direct the department of education to withhold up to ten per cent PERCENT of the monthly apportionment of state aid that would otherwise be due the school district or charter school.In other words: don t teach anything that helps build up tolerance and acceptance of any repressed minority group or you will be punished with the money your districts so desperately need.When it comes to the state university system (institutions of higher learning), the legislation almost mirrors that for public k-12 schooling:A UNIVERSITY UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE ARIZONA BOARD OF REGENTS OR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT SHALL NOT INCLUDE IN ITS PROGRAM OF INSTRUCTION ANY COURSES, CLASSES, EVENTS OR ACTIVITIES THAT DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:Like K-12 institutions, state colleges and universities would be stripped of 10 percent of their state funding if found to be intentionally or unintentionally in violation.The problem with this law is clear: it s too broadly written, it stifles education, and it deprives students of their ability to learn about different ideologies and current events in today s America. On the surface, it sounds good   no public school should be able to promote violence, resentment or hatred towards the United States government or any group of people. However, once we start telling people they can t advocate for the social justice of anyone, no matter who it is being oppressed, we become complacent with discrimination and oppression of peoples all across the globe.Does this mean professors wouldn t be able to lecture or promote the human rights of those living in Israeli-Palestinian territory? Does it mean they cannot promote the  never forget  mantra of Nazi Germany atrocities because it s promoting  social justice  for Jews, Poles, the disabled, Gay and Romani people?The list   and the subsequent debate   could go on and on.This Orwellian, revisionist history is dangerous and it s un-American. It stifles freedom of speech   even speech we may not agree with   and shields students from different opinions and outlooks on life. Students paying thousands of dollars to attend a state university should not have their right to speak and learn freely striped of them by their government.The snowflake Republicans are at it again, and this time they re the ones who need a safe space from the big, bad social justice warriors.Featured image via KTAR News""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Every claim simply has not been substantiated yet   just as literally the whole world has been reporting from Day One of Shower Time.Here s what is actually being reported: CNN and numerous people in the intelligence field have verified that documents exist accusing Trump s campaign team of directly colluding with Russia (and, yes, there s a bit in there about Trump giving some Russian women money to pee on his bed while he watched). The documents, which have been floating around since well before October, contain claims that are not fully vetted and some that have been recognized as inaccurate from the very beginning. Trump and Obama were both briefed on the documents on the same day, which sent Trump into a seemingly neverending all-caps tantrum over the situation.To make matters worse for The Donald, the BBC now reports that at least four sources back the claims, and a CIA contact told them that there is video and audio of Donald Trump in  compromising situations  with women in both Moscow (Putin s neighborhood) and St. Petersberg, which is known as  a lively center of child prostitution attracting some Western men to take trips there. I saw the report, compiled by the former British intelligence officer, back in October,  BBC correspondent Paul Wood said earlier this week.  He is not, and this is the crucial thing, the only source for this.  After reaching out for information, Wood says a source affiliated with the U.S. intelligence community explained there is   more than one tape, not just video, but audio as well, on more than one date, in more than one place, in both Moscow and St. Petersburg. To make matters worse for Trump, at least three people have responded to Penthouse magazine s $1 million bounty on video of Trump enjoying  golden shower time. Are the allegations true?

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""By now, we re all familiar with Trumpkins  idiotic attempts to show that liberals are hypocrites by claiming that we scream for tolerance, yet we re intolerant of their own hateful, bigoted views. After all, doesn t  tolerance  mean accepting every viewpoint there is? These people are desperate to prove that we are just as hypocritical as they are, but their  tolerance  analogy just flat-out doesn t work. John Pavlovitz, a true Christian pastor from North Carolina (of all places), and someone who regularly calls the right-wing out, explains why.Early on in his post, Pavlovitz throws this out at conservatives who want liberals to tolerate their hate: The commitment to diversity and equality means demanding that everyone gets a seat at the table; that each person s inherent worth is recognized there, that no one is devalued or excluded based on a fixed and fundamental part of their identity: skin color, gender, nation of origin, sexual orientation, religion, etc.This means that we declare every human being equally valuable. It does not mean we treat all opinions and all behavior equally. And then he says this, which should put all the immature conservative Trump lovers who are looking for someone to validate their hate into a massive tizzy: If your opinion directly endangers people based on those essential parts of who they are we ll pushback [sic].If you re [sic] worldview permits you to treat someone as less deserving of civil rights or it discards their basic humanity your worldview is a threat to true diversity.If your evaluation of another makes you more tolerant of their mistreatment or less outraged by hate crimes against them, that s a fundamental problem.Discrimination and violence don t get a seat at the table. They don t get proximity to do damage The contention for the past year has been that all political perspectives are valid, but I won t consent to that and it s a matter of personal safety. No individual groups of white people are explicitly, measurably endangered by a Progressive platform, they receive the same consideration. But I can illustrate the specific ways people of color, immigrants, Muslims, women, and the LGBTQ community are less safe and less represented by the coming Administration, which is already by its conduct, a movement of exclusion. And that s the difference that our narrow-minded, racist, misogynistic right wing does not understand when they cry and whine about tolerance. They don t give a rat s ass about diversity   they just want their viewpoints normalized and accepted, no matter how harmful they may be. When the  tolerance  they want doesn t come, they cry like spoiled toddlers.They re full of hate and they are asshats about it, and what they want should never be allowed to stand: If you believe people of color are simply inferior to white people, you re going to have to work hard to stay at the table.If you claim LGBTQ people to be abominations, you ll have to do better. If you believe Muslims are likely terrorists, you probably won t feel welcome at the table for long.And so no, it isn t at all hypocritical to champion diversity and to confront injustice simultaneously. They are fully collaborative and integrated movements.All people are welcomed at the table but bigotry isn t, so save the allegation that its acceptance is a requirement.Equality demands deceny [sic] toward humanity s diverse gathering and it s what I demand. It s what we all should demand. What they re demanding of us is a pass for their hate and their discrimination. They aren t demanding anything like tolerance   they wouldn t know what tolerance was if it bit them in the ass.Read Pavlovitz  full opinion here.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It s been an awakening,  Richard B. Spencer, who is credited with coining the term alt-right, said at the gathering on Saturday.  This is what a successful movement looks like.

White nationalists also like the nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who s seen as being close to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, a darling of the alt-right.While Trump s cabinet might be a little too globalist for these mouth breathers, there s still plenty for them to love.

I no longer have that confidence in him,  Rep. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, said as he left the meeting in the Capitol.

The BBC says that intelligence agents in Europe believe there is much more compromising and  embarrassing  material about Donald Trump in the possession of the Kremlin than previously believed.Just weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Comey announced in a letter that the FBI was launching an investigation into the use of a private email server by Hillary Clinton.

The FBI director is a good man who was placed in a very difficult position,  said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.).  His boss [U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch] made life very difficult for him in the last year when she met with Bill Clinton on the tarmac. I want to [have faith in Comey],  said a visibly annoyed Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.).  I have concerns. Stay tuned. I m disappointed, outraged   many of us are right now,  Walz said.

Shortly after the meeting, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she has not lost confidence in the agency. No, I haven t lost confidence in the agency,  she said. Pelosi expressed concern over the timing. And that was the judgment of Director Comey, unless it goes deeper, and that s what the investigation will find out,  she continued.

The Women s March on Washington will send a bold message to our new government on their first day in office, and to the world that women s rights are human rights.

That s pretty interesting considering the current situation, but it s probably the recent bombshell report by a BBC correspondent that there are at least four sources for what Trump is calling fake news. According to Paul Wood in a recent op-ed:Claims about a Russian blackmail tape were made in one of a series of reports written by a former British intelligence agent. As a member of MI6, he had been posted to the UK s embassy in Moscow and now runs a consultancy giving advice on doing business in Russia. He spoke to a number of his old contacts in the FSB, the successor to the KGB, paying some of them for information. .The former MI6 agent is not the only source for the claim about Russian kompromat on the president-elect. Back in August, a retired spy told me he had been informed of its existence by  the head of an East European intelligence agency .Later, I used an intermediary to pass some questions to active duty CIA officers dealing with the case file  they would not speak to me directly. I got a message back that there was  more than one tape ,  audio and video , on  more than one date , in  more than one place  in the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow and also in St Petersburg  and that the material was  of a sexual nature . The claims of Russian kompromat on Mr Trump were  credible , the CIA believed. .Last April, the CIA director was shown intelligence that worried him. It was  allegedly  a tape recording of a conversation about money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign.It was passed to the US by an intelligence agency of one of the Baltic States.The CIA cannot act domestically against American citizens so a joint counter-intelligence taskforce was created .A lawyer  outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case  told me that three of Mr Trump s associates were the subject of the inquiry.  But it s clear this is about Trump,  he said.Audio. And. Video.Trump spent well over a half hour attacking Hillary Clinton and screaming about how the Kremlin is right. He did this a week before he officially becomes President.

(11 CFR   103.3 (b)(1)) The refund must be made within 30 days of the treasurer becoming aware of the illegality of the contribution.

All told, Trump s campaign appears to have received illegal donations from 65 companies, and excessive donations from hundreds of individual donors.Now, as Christina Wilkie points out on Twitter, it s not unusual for the FEC to send letters to campaigns after the election is over that seek clarification on things.

Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson Trump s pick for HUD Secretary started off the confirmation hearing today with a bang, refusing to say that the president-elect and his family wouldn t profit from the agency he hopes to head. To top that off, part of Carson s prepared opening statement appears to contain word-for-word plagiarism, according to The Washington Post.However, the Senate Banking Committee did not hear the plagiarized sections because Carson used his typical off-the-cuff style during his testimony   leaving behind his prepared remarks.Carson s prepared remarks were taken verbatim:The two paragraphs in question focused on the health problems caused by lead exposure in young children. According to the Post, they were taken verbatim from  Where We Live Matters For Our Health,  a 2008 report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.A Trump transition spokeswoman told The Washington Post that the plagiarized text was included accidentally, and that Carson never intended to read it at his hearing. We re not sure exactly what accidental plagiarism is.Prepared statements from nomination hearings are typically entered into the congressional record. It was a written statement for the record   his oral testimony, as I am sure you ve heard, is extemporaneous and planned that way,  the spokeswoman told the Post.  The original written statement was sourced with hyperlinks and footnotes, but unfortunately that seems to have fallen off.According to the Post, however, there was no sourcing included in the copies of prepared text which was passed out to reporters at the hearing.In mid-November, Carson declined a Trump cabinet position, citing his lack of experience. Even though he lacks political experience, the sleepy-eyed doctor ran for the GOP nomination for the presidency. Carson now wants to lead a massive agency with 8,300 employees and a budget of about $48 billion. Carson said he s a good pick for the position because he grew up in inner-city Detroit with a single mother who had a third-grade education and worked several jobs to keep a roof over their heads and put food on the table.At the hearing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren asked Carson,  Can you assure me that not a single taxpayer dollar you give out will financial benefit the president-elect or his family?

Carson has no experience in urban development, government, real estate, or anything else relating to the job he s trying to be confirmed to do, and therefore has no business being nominated for it. Therefore, his confirmation is   and should be!   especially difficult. Well, have no fear   Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren made sure of that.Senator Warren s first order of business was to make sure that Donald Trump, who is obviously a real estate tycoon, would not benefit from the activities of HUD under Ben Carson. Warren asked of Carson: Can you assure me that not a single taxpayer dollar you give out will financial benefit the president-elect or his family? Carson could not make that assurance directly, and said that he could only assure that would refuse to play favorites,  continuing: I can assure you that the things that I do are driven by a sense of morals and values. That wasn t good enough for Warren, though, and she pushed Carson further: It s not about your good faith. My concern is whether or not, among the billions of dollars you will be responsible for handing out in grants and loans, can you just assure us that not $1 will go to benefit either the president-elect or his family? Carson said of that question: It will not be my intention to do anything to benefit [Trump]. Since Carson refused to give any direct answers here, Warren drew her own conclusions saying: Do I take that to mean you may manage programs that will significantly benefit the president-elect? Carson insisted: You can take it to mean that I will manage things in a way that benefits the American people. Carson went on to say that he wouldn t directly promise that he wouldn t use Trump s family properties for HUD programs: If there happens to be an extraordinary program that s working for millions of people, and it turns out that someone that you re targeting is going to gain $10 from it, am I going to say,  No, the rest of you Americans can t have it?  I think logic and common sense probably would be the best way. Warren concluded: The problem is that you can t assure us that HUD money   not of $10 varieties but of multimillion-dollar varieties   will not end up in the president-elect s pockets. And that s just the problem. Donald Trump is surrounding himself with sycophants like Ben Carson, who will use their positions of power to do anything Trump wants   including using federal dollars to line Trump s pockets.

Unfortunately, now that the GOP has taken back control of Congress with its disastrous President-elect Donald Trump, the Republican Party is making moves to undo all of Obama s hard work   starting with health care.Late on Wednesday night, the Senate made a disgustingly sneaky move toward repealing the Affordable Care Act, and shot down proposed amendments to protect Americans with preexisting conditions from discrimination and losing coverage.TwitterOn Thursday morning, Americans across the country woke up to a nightmare. Not only did they discover that the Senate was making fast moves to gut the Affordable Care Act, but many of them would be facing life or death consequences thanks to the Republican Party s agenda. As one woman said to Rep. Keith Ellison (D -MN) on Twitter, As a breast cancer survivor, this is a death sentence for me.  She was far from alone in that fear.Before Republicans knew it, people from across the country were using the hashtag #SaveTheACA to vent both their despair and desperation. Many of them are fully aware that once the ACA is taken away, they will die   and the GOP will be to blame.The GOP never banked on this kind of backlash   and here s what many Americans had to say:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterCurrently, the GOP has no reasonable plan to replace health care   and innocent Americans will be the ones to suffer.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Senate Democrats seem to know that and have been using it to force Republicans to vote for things they might not otherwise vote for out of fear of pissing off their constituents.Last night, and into this morning, in fact, the Democrats of the Senate forced the GOP s hand on healthcare. No, they didn t force Republicans to admit they want to destroy Obamacare   we already know that. They engaged in a  vote-a-rama  of sorts to force Republicans to vote to gut things that their constituents will hate. They forced Republicans to admit that they re perfectly fine gutting Medicare, Medicaid, mental healthcare, women s healthcare, and more.How did they do it? They engaged in a  vote-a-rama,  in which they presented a series of amendments to a budget resolution intended to allow Congress to repeal Obamacare with simple majorities in both houses.Every one of those amendments failed. Quelle surprise, though.Several Democrats in the Senate made a point of voicing their objections as they cast their  no  votes on the budget resolution measure. For instance, Sen. Claire McCaskill (R-Missouri) said,  Because there is no replace, I vote no. The vote-a-rama lasted nearly seven hours, and included not only Democratic amendments to protect Medicare and Medicaid, but also, late Wednesday evening, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: Put this irresponsible and rushed repeal plan aside. Work with us Democrats on a way to improve health care in America, not put chaos in place of affordable care. Mitch McConnell, however, had his own statement to issue when the vote was complete: The Senate just took an important step toward repealing and replacing Obamacare by passing the resolution that provides the legislative tools necessary to actually repeal this failed law while we move ahead with smarter health care policies. Republicans have never actually been able to point to anything that proves the ACA (which, yes, is Obamacare) is a failed policy. Does it have problems? Yes. Name one thing that doesn t, though, especially a program this complex that s only in its fledgling years.But repealing Obamacare means so much more than just ending a so-called  failed  law. It means harming millions of people in pursuit of a political goal   one that their constituents don t believe will hurt them because they literally think that Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are two different things.Republicans don t care about collateral damage, though. They got their repeal measure through over and above the efforts of Democrats to stop it. But stopping it wasn t the Democrats  only objective. They seemed to know that, if they couldn t stop this, they could either embarrass Republicans with their votes, or force them to admit to things they don t want to admit to.Photo of Chuck Schumer by Win McNamee/Getty Images.

During the Ronald Reagan administration, Sessions was nominated as a federal judge.One of Sessions  primary critics at his Senate hearing three decades ago was Thomas Figures, a black assistant U.S. attorney who had previously worked for him. Figures, who died in 2015, told the committee that Sessions had called him  boy  more than once   a slur meant to demean and disrespect when used to address black men.Sessions also joked about the Ku Klux Klan, according to Figures: He recalled Sessions describing the KKK as  OK until he learned that they smoked marijuana.  And Figures said Sessions had called the NAACP, the storied African-American civil rights group,  anti-American. Source: Huffington PostDuring his first confirmation hearing, more than 30 years ago, Sessions was deemed too racist to serve on the bench. Is it any wonder that today, the same questions have arisen?Sessions denies that he still holds these beliefs. During this round of hearings, Session said that the KKK had a  hateful ideology  and that he supports civil rights. He does, however, support voter ID laws, which most courts agree are discriminatory.Brooks, though, who s from Sessions  home state, paints a different picture. He sees Sessions as a victim. He also sees white people as victims of the Voting Rights Act.The Alabama congressman argued that the VRA treated certain areas  differently  by requiring federal pre-clearance of changes to voting laws in states where there had been a history of voter suppression, until that provision was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013. That s only a tool that the Democrats are using,  he said of VRA pre-clearance. It s really about political power and racial division and what I ve referred to on occasion as the  war on whites,  he added.  They are trying to motivate the African-American vote to vote-bloc for Democrats by using every  Republican is a racist  tool that they can envision, even if they have to lie about it.

Well, this gentleman gave The Donald one for free and he can provide evidence.Meet Dino Rachiele. A quick scroll through his Facebook timeline shows that he doesn t post about politics much, if any (though one post reveals that he makes a delicious-looking Timpano), but he is now gaining recognition for a video he made years ago in which he spoke out about the time that he gave a certain billionaire a golden shower. This video was largely ignored until now but with news breaking that Trump allegedly paid a couple of nice Russian ladies to  drain the swamp  on his bed, his YouTube video is picking up traffic quite quickly.Rachiele manufactures high-end sinks (what did you think we meant by  golden shower,  perverts?) and used to sell home fixtures, according to Gizmodo. In his 2011 video,  I gave Donald Trump a golden shower,  Rachiele   who inexplicably found himself able to vote for someone as terrible as Trump   says he sent Donald Trump one of two gold shower heads in 2007 and decided to gift one of them to The Donald during one of his feuds with Rosie O Donnell because he knows, like a couple Russian prostitutes seem to know, that Donald Trump just adores gold.Now, some might consider it unbelievable that Rachiele gave The Donald a golden shower, so here s a letter from Trump s assistant at the time verifying that Rachiele did, indeed, send Trump a golden showerhead, but it also seems to indicate that it was part of a sales pitch. The letter informed Rachiele that Trump  has no interest in purchasing at this time  with a vague promise of possibly working together in the future and a boilerplate  we wish you the greatest success in your endeavors):In what seems to be a clear attempt to create a demand for a  limited edition  product by first sending one to Trump and later deceptively omitting the fact that it was manufactured by a company owned by Rachiele, he then invites people to email him to get what he claims is the only other one in existence for the hefty price tag of $350. Either he was lying about it being the only one or there were no takers, as he now says he is considering taking bids on it.If conservatives are as stupid as I know they are, Rachiele will be getting his own  golden shower  soon enough when one of them spends their kid s college fund on this piece of poorly manufactured history.Watch his video below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It was issued by someone who is former MI6 and probably has his own style of header. That entire argument is dead from the get-go. But the post is from November 1,  you might say. Yes, this is true that the post predates the full release of the information, but Mother Jones has been reporting on this for longer than that. In fact, it seems that the post in question was meant to discredit that much lighter report and has simply been repurposed as a matter of convenience. Mother Jones previously did not release the full details   including the  golden showers  bit   because it had not been confirmed, but has since done so as the information has been released elsewhere.

No one has updated the story to name him as the source, so that s pretty well settled. Naturally, he included a stab at conservatives for calling this  fake news  while believing actual fake news:The real shame of this entire situation is that we re wasting valuable time Trump could be using to uncover the real secrets of John Podesta and Hillary Clinton s PizzaGate global child kidnapping and cannibalism ring.

We ll just ask you to consider that the intelligence community does know the identity of the source, has worked with him in the past, and considers him to be credible.Will this stop you, conservatives, from sharing your ridiculous claims that this is  FAKE NEWS  and a  POLITICAL WITCH HUNT  as Donald Trump put it?

Hillary Clinton is also a fan of the Cubs so Trump could easily use the event to take shots at her as well.To save the country from such embarrassment and to avoid shaking Trump s tiny hands, the Cubs have decided that it is more convenient for them to travel to the White House on Monday while President Obama is still in office.As Mediaite points out, teams have visited the White House early in previous years so this would normally not be a big deal. But this is not a normal time because if the Cubs wait until April they would have to stand and be honored by a bigot who constantly hurls petty insults at people and thinks everything is about himself.Trump will likely feel slighted by the Cubs and will launch an attack against them on Twitter any time now.

It s going horribly, considering Trump has decided to fight the report by foolishly tweeting, creating even more controversy and drawing more attention to himself.One person who has always been amazing at criticizing Trump in the most logical, sound way is legendary news reporter Dan Rather. There would be no one better to ask about the latest allegations, and TMZ happened to nab a short interview with him as he was leaving 30 Rock to ask him what he thought of the latest Trump scandal.Rather was careful to emphasize that the allegations were in fact just allegations at this point, and have not been confirmed. However, he made sure to state that Trump s presidential transition has been unlike any other in so many ways   and none of them are good.

At a time when many of us were feeling heartbroken and depressed that this great leader would now be followed by an underserving former reality television star, Obama made sure to leave us with a message of hope and reminded us of what we re fighting for. It was a beautiful speech, and it highlighted everything we are going to miss about him.One of the more notable parts of the speech was an epic burn Obama delivered, aimed right at President-elect Donald Trump. While Obama never once said Trump s name, it was blatantly obvious who he was talking about as he spoke about the need for diverse groups of workers to unite and stand together. Slamming Trump s divisive rhetoric and policies, Obama reached out to workers of all ages, races, genders, and professions when he said: But we re not where we need to be. All of us have more work to do. After all, if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves. If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don t look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children   because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America s workforce. And our economy doesn t have to be a zero-sum game. Last year, incomes rose for all races, all age groups, for men and for women. Beautifully said. While Trump may have won the election by dividing Americans and speaking only to white workers in certain professions, Americans can stop him from dividing us further by standing together. Aside from preventing Trump from creating more division, united workers must also defy him by standing up to his greedy pro-corporation agenda which will only benefit the wealthiest.Obama knew that he had to inspire Americans enough to get them through the next four years under the worst administration they ve ever been faced with.

That night, my dad told us he would be president one day.Then four years later, he fulfilled my dad s prophecy.Eight years ago, I supported Hillary Clinton in a contentious, bitter primary. I was ready for the first woman president, and I thought she was going to win. How could she not?And a long journey for me and my country began.I looked around me and saw that the comfortable life I have lived was starting to crack   along with every other American citizen. The easier life we all lived post-Clinton was a thing of the past.The economy was collapsing, and people were suffering. Uncertainty plagued every household, every employee and every employer.It seemed that all hope in our great country and the foundation that held it was lost. Teachers, firefighters, office workers and nurses waited for their pink slips. Homeowners waited for their foreclosure notices. Sick seniors dreaded their medical bills.Then flashed on the screen: HOPE AND CHANGE.Handsome, charismatic, and dignified, the junior senator from Illinois, who no one had really heard of before 2008, entered our lives and gave us hope once more. His message shined bright with me and millions of Americans   that our best days were ahead, and if we worked together and trusted one another, we would prevail. It was change we could believe in, and boy did I believe it.And I believe it now more than ever as this great man prepares to leave office, even in the face of an oncoming Trump Administration.The facts remain: the deficit has been cut by two-thirds. The stock market hit its highest points in history (and still continues to grow). Eleven million jobs have been created, 30 million Americans now have healthcare, and the auto industry has been saved. Wages, for all races and incomes, are up for the first time in a decade. Same-sex marriage is the law of the land, and the Pentagon has opened up its door to women in all areas of expertise.In other words   this country has been changed for the better, and it was the hope and perseverance of President Obama that got us here. I can see around me how much better off we are. The truth is right in front of our eyes, we don t need the facts to tell us that (but they certainly don t hurt to have in front of you during a debate).Now that doesn t mean he was perfect. The TPP, the large scale use of drones, the failure to fully communicate Obamacare and the need for a strong government irked me at times. But unlike left-wing and right-wing ideologies, I never looked for a pure president.No one is perfect, and they can never govern perfectly.So with absolutely no help from Republicans, congressional and state, President Obama never wavered in his commitment to allow the American citizen to indulge in the promise that all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.We have more liberty, and I believe we are a happier nation because of him.President Obama inspired me to pursue my own happiness. I m a sophomore in college, currently working on a degree in political science. I hope to go to law school, specialize in constitutional law, and utilize my resources to bring change   good change   to Washington D.C. I m a political writer, entering my fourth year of grinding out my passion for politics on paper. All of this, all the passion, anger, hope and sense of accomplishment I have when I write and share it with the world, I owe to President Obama.I ve burned many bridges, ended a couple friendships, and argued with a lot of people defending President Obama and his policies. I have not one regret. And I would do it all over again.I came of age in the era of Obama. My world view of politics and culture have been shaped, in large part, because of him. He is, as some publications put it, the most consequential president in modern America.His presidency, marked with dignity and grace   not scandal   was a gift to America and her people. He showed us what a calm, collected family man from the south side of Chicago could do with a little bit of hope, and yearning for change. A black man with the  funny name  (as he puts it), who grew up without his father and with his white mother and grandparents, transformed the face of this nation for generations to come.How profound is that?I will miss his calm, cool demeanor in times of crisis. I will miss his loving, inspiring message of hope. I ll miss his family   especially Michelle, a First Lady who was the pinnacle of elegance.Thanks, President Obama, my president, for helping this naive and politically inept 11 year old grow up into a passionate, fired-up 19 year old, who only wants to grow and do good for his fellow man.President Obama, you built that.

On Tuesday, the network reported that a two-page summary had been provided to President Barack Obama and Donald Trump, and Trump is pissed off now that the content has been released in full by Buzzfeed.While it is important to note that the report is not completely verified, the document reveals some information that Trump probably wanted to keep private   like that time he was staying at a hotel in Russia and paid some nice ladies to pee on his bed (not to mention evidence that Trump s campaign worked directly with the Russian government). According to Source D, where s/he had been present, Trump s (perverted) conduct in Moscow included hiring the Presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where he knew President and Mrs Obama (whom he hated) had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a [redacted] show in front of him,  the report reads.Naturally, Trump couldn t handle this  big reveal  and completely flew off the handle on Twitter:This was just too much for the people of Twitter to handle, and they responded perfectly to the puddle Trump had stepped in:@realDonaldTrump you sound pissed.

On Tuesday, Comey came under fire from a Democratic senator for refusing to say if the agency is investigating Donald Trump s campaign connection to the hacking operation spearheaded by Vladimir Putin. As you know, the Russian foreign minister was quoted in various news reports saying that the Russians had had contacts with people associated with the Trump campaign,  Oregon Senator Ron Wyden said during Comey s appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Now that may or may not be true   My question to Director Comey is: Has the FBI investigated these reported relationships and, if so, what are the agencies finding? I would never comment on investigation whether we have one or not in an open forum like this,  Comey replied.  I really can t answer one way or another. Unless you have a very short memory, you are probably aware that Comey broke Justice Department protocol when he sent a letter to Republicans last year indicating that the FBI had discovered emails  pertinent  to an investigation of Hillary Clinton s private email server. After right-wing media and Donald Trump used Comey s controversial letter to create a false narrative that evidence had been uncovered of some sort of wrongdoing, Comey was forced to admit that Clinton committed no criminal wrongdoing. Unfortunately, the damage was already done. Will you provide an unclassified response to these questions and release it to the American people prior to January 20?  Wyden asked. Sir, I will answer any question you ask, but the answer will likely be the same as I just gave you. I can t talk about it,  Comey told the Senator, who had finally had enough of the suddenly evasive Comey   a man who only a little over a month ago was willing to break protocol in what was clearly an attempt to hurt Hillary Clinton: I will tell you that I think the American people have a right to know this. And if there is delay in declassifying this information and relaying it to the American people, releasing it to the American people. That doesn t happen before January 20, I m not sure it s going to happen. If information is not released before January 20, it is likely that Senator Wyden is correct that it may never happen   and Comey s evasiveness only lends to the fairly concrete theory that he knowingly interfered with the election by helping Trump build his propaganda campaign.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2014Kennedy wrote an article in 2005 titled  Deadly Immunity,  in which he argued that the mercury-based chemical thimerosal causes autism in children. Not only is there zero evidence to support this claim, but thimerosal isn t even used in vaccines anymore. This article, which was published in both Rolling Stone and Salon, also alleged a vast conspiracy to hide this link.Science writer Seth Mnookin explained in his book,  The Panic Virus,  that if Kennedy s claims were true, this would mean scientists and officials in governmental agencies, nonprofit organizations, and publicly held companies around the world would need to be part of a coordinated multi-decade scheme to prop up  the vaccine industry s bottom line  by masking the dangers of thimerosal.  Salon eventually withdrew Kennedy s article.Ten years later, in 2015, Kennedy promoted the film,  Trace Amounts,  which drew the same faulty conclusions about vaccines causing autism as his book. The film told viewers,  They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone. This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.

Sessions lost the case, and no one was indicted because the volunteers did nothing wrong. Sessions just hates black people and sees their voting as a crime.Even former colleagues testified that Sessions is a racist.According to the New York Times,In testimony before the committee, former colleagues said that Mr. Sessions had referred to the N.A.A.C.P., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other civil rights groups as  un-American  and  Communist-inspired.  An African-American federal prosecutor then, Thomas H. Figures, said Mr. Sessions had referred to him as  boy  and testified that Mr. Sessions said the Ku Klux Klan was fine  until I found out they smoked pot. If you still need proof that Sessions is a racist, just consider that white supremacists cheered when Trump announced his nomination.But there is one piece of testimony that Republicans have been suppressing for decades that would be a nail in the coffin of Sessions  effort to become Attorney General.In 1986, Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote a letter of testimony to the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee that ended up rejecting Sessions.Buzzfeed reports that racist Senator Strom Thurmond refused to put the letter in the Congressional record and the contents have been kept from public view ever since. But Knight Rider reporter Aaron Epstein published a piece of it in 1986 that explains why we should not believe Sessions when he claims he isn t racist. For a century, the racial practices that characterized our region were established and enforced by men who, like Mr. Sessions, protested that they, too, were not personally hostile to blacks,  King wrote.And that line alone should disqualify Sessions from ever being more than a racist senator.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, who is Donald Trump s nominee to be attorney general, faced the Senate Judiciary Committee this morning. And, in typical Republican fashion, he denied, deflected, and lied.In his opening statements, Sessions pointed to a number of issues currently facing the country: LGBT rights, voting rights, systemic racism, and religious freedom.Based on his moving speech, with his soft-spoken southern demeanor, one wouldn t know who Jeff Sessions really is   an anti-woman, anti-LGBT, anti-black, and anti-immigrant demagogue.Take, for example, the comparing and contrasting of Sessions  statements vs. the facts.Statement: A special priority for me in this regard will be aggressive enforcement of our laws to ensure access to the ballot for every eligible American voter, without hindrance or discrimination, and to ensure the integrity of the electoral process I deeply understand the history of civil rights and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters.Fact:Even though Sessions voted to reauthorize it in 2006 (with reservations), the Senator argued in 1996 that the Voting Rights Act was  engineering  a political outcome, and championed the repeal of sections 3 and 5 of the Act (even while senator), which set up special protections in southern states to combat discriminatory voting practices that were regulated by the federal government. In 2013, the Supreme Court repealed Section 3 (which rendered Section 5 moot), a decision which has opened the floodgates to anti-voting laws throughout the South, especially in North Carolina. Sessions cheered this on, calling it  good news for the South.  This is what Sessions fought for but failed in the Senate.In 1985, Sessions prosecuted three black men, which included MLK s former aid Albert Turner, on charges of voter fraud with very little evidence. The  Marion Three  as they became known as were renowned in their community for being voting rights and registration activists. They were acquitted by a jury after only three hours of deliberation, and Sessions, while admitting he doesn t regret his decision, admitted he was shoddy in his approach. That s what the Justice Department needs   a shoddy attorney who might have wrongfully convicted black civil rights activists.Sessions  office also dropped the case with regards to a man who was lynched by the KKK. The members, who were caught, were eventually tried and convicted, but not by Session s office.Sessions, as everyone knows, referred to the NAACP as  un-American  and then said it could be construed as being  un-American. Sessions also supports the discriminatory voter ID laws  on the surface. How is Attorney General Sessions going to tackle the mounting anti-voting laws being passed in southern states after the provisions he hated were gutted? How will he be able to divorce his decades-long war against black activists who want the freedom to vote without, as Sessions put it, hindrance or discrimination?Statement:I understand the demands for justice and fairness made by the LGBT community.Facts:Senator Sessions has a zero rating from the United States  largest gay rights advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign. Sessions opposes same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption rights, and voted against hate crimes preventions (he said such legislation would  cheapen civil rights  in America). He opposed the repeal of Don t Ask, Don t Tell, and supports a federal marriage amendment.With regards to the possibility of a gay supreme court justice, Sessions is on record saying,  that would be a big concern that the American people might feel might feel uneasy about that. So, in a nutshell, no, Sessions does not  understand  the demands of justice and fairness made by the LGBT community. He hears them, but he doesn t care about them or their rights, dignity and respect.Statement:I understand the lifelong scars born by women who are victims of assault and abuse.Facts:Senator Sessions voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act in 2013, citing concerns about issues pertaining to tribal procedure, although the issues pertaining to LGBT women may have played a role in Sessions   no  vote.In October, when a video surfaced of Donald Trump bragging about grabbing a woman by the genitals, Sessions was asked whether or not he believed such bragging constituted sexual assault. His Response?  I don t characterize that as sexual assault, I think that s a stretch   I don t know. It s not clear that he   how that would occur. Sessions voted against the largest piece of legislation that helps combat abuse and defended his preferred candidate when it became evident he has sexually assaulted at least one woman in his lifetime.Sessions lied through his teeth in his confirmation hearing. He has absolutely no idea as to the plight of women, African-Americans, gays, or anyone else for that matter. He has inflated his record, he has miscategorized his past statements and votes, and he would be the most ass-backwards thinking attorney general in years.We cannot let him get away with his revisionist history.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The man s integrity, his decency and optimism about America that he embodied and pursued will be his legacy. Referring to the Obama administration as patriotic and pure,  Carney said: It was an honest and sincere effort driven towards the idea of making America better and improving the lives of everyday Americans. Many of us would agree. You can watch Carney deliver every Republican s worst nightmare below:Obama demonstrated and lived America s values every day of his life, and every day of his presidency.

In a recent interview with Harper s BAZAAR, Madonna got real about how everyday life has been since the Electoral College allowed a completely undeserving bigot to lead this country for the next four years. Opening up about a feeling that many of us are now all too familiar with, Madonna said that every day she s woken up and it s felt like when you break up with somebody who has really broken your heart. Many Americans have been equally heartbroken and disappointed about the election results, and are frightened about the future of the country. She said: It s like being dumped by a lover and also being stuck in a nightmare. Reflecting on the night Trump was elected, Madonna said she was doing what most Americans were: I was sitting at a table with my agent, who is also one of my very best friends, and we were truly praying. We were praying We were doing everything: lighting candles, meditating, praying, offering our lives to God forever, if only. Despite the collective despair that many Americans are feeling right now, Madonna says that she   and every other American that rejected Trump   can t quietly accept defeat.

People like Mitch McConnell are already acting like it s done deal. People like Paul Ryan think things like tax-free health savings accounts are the answer to our healthcare woes. Trump himself has said he wants the repeal to happen as soon as possible. So it should be a foregone conclusion that all of this is happening in the very near future.Except it might not.Republicans need 50 votes in the Senate to pass their repeal. They have 52 seats. If they lose three votes, they ll have 49.With just 49 votes, the repeal effort fails.But which three? The truth is that not every Republican is happy with the idea of repealing the law now and working on a replacement later. They ve had six years to come up with a replacement, as Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) acknowledges. They haven t done so. The idea that they can now come up with a good replacement before millions lose their healthcare coverage is laughable at best, but really, it s cold-blooded fuckery.Corker, along with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), strongly oppose passing any repeals without simultaneously passing their replacement plan.These are the three who are likely to derail the repeal effort.Even better (worse?) is that Corker, along with Sens. Rob Portman (R-OH), Susan Collins (R-ME), Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have introduced an amendment to the repeal bill that would push the vote back a month:Five GOP senators offer an amendment to extend the Obamacare repeal reconciliation deadline by more than a MONTH. pic.twitter.com/8MPlAy50mR  Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) January 9, 2017That goes directly against Mitch McConnell s insistence that they ll repeal the law soon, and then come up with a replacement  rapidly,  which happened over the weekend in an interview on CBS   Face the Nation.  However, he couldn t give us anything like a timetable for the replacement, even though he was pressed hard.Let s also not forget all the Republican governors who are currently trying to pressure Congress into holding off repealing the ACA. These are governors who ve seen massive benefits to their states from the Medicaid expansion in the ACA. A full repeal means all states that expanded Medicaid will lose their federal funding for it. Governors, regardless of party, hate that.Democrats will block repeal efforts as best they can not just because they oppose Republicans, but because what paltry fragments of plans the Republicans do have rob from the poor to give to the rich. For instance, they want to greatly expand the use of health savings accounts, which helps absolutely no one who can t afford to put any money away for anything (like retirement, their children s college, their own savings, etc.). Sure, the accounts are tax-free, but they re a way to force us to pay even more for our healthcare than we already do.Neither McConnell nor Ryan will be happy with their own turning against them on something they and their handlers insist must be done now, and fuck the people who will end up as collateral damage while they dicker over a full replacement plan. But it s true that if Corker, Paul and Alexander block the repeal bill because there s no replacement to go with it, then the effort fails.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Conway told Capitol Download that she doesn t feel more investigations are needed into the Kremlin s attack on our nation last year that helped barely  win  Trump the presidency (with a huge asterisk). In fact, we re such good friends with Russia now that Putin helped The Donald with his little  getting elected  issue that Conway says Trump is going to look into lifting some of those pesky sanctions Putin couldn t get Obama to lift. I predict that President Trump will want to make sure that our actions are proportionate to what occurred, based on what we know, Conway said, claiming that we have imposed harsher sanctions on the country that directly interfered in our election rather than North Korea and China after they hacked our nation.Conway attacked a bipartisan effort to get to the bottom of the hack, mocking Democrats   not Republicans, who have spent the last eight years focusing solely on obstructing President Obama   for attempting to work with the other side. It s curious and a little bit humorous that Democrats would talk about anything bipartisan   given how they have vowed to obstruct everything we do,  she said, adding that there is  a great deal of information out there  about the hack. I do find it to be very ironic that the uptick and the hue-and-cry of  investigation  and  information  has occurred after the election results are in,  she added, completely forgetting that Hillary Clinton warned us of this exact scenario during the time leading up to the election and was mocked by Republicans when she suggested we look into it. The fact is, the Democrats became super-duper interested in this entire issue after the election did not go the way they, quote, wanted and the way they expected. But it s not just Democrats who think that a foreign power interfering with and manipulating our election, especially at this level, is a problem. While most Republicans have remained silent in cowardly acceptance of the huge gift that has been given to them by Vladimir Putin and company, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and a few others have also called for an investigation.Now, our next President   whom a foreign dictator helped get into office by personally spearheading a hack of his political opponents and an aggressive propaganda campaign   is poised to reward said dictator by lifting sanctions.

And one person who is standing up to defend the famed actress is none other than famed actor/director Ron Howard.Taking to Twitter, and taking aim at a few Twitter troll, egg profiles and all, Howard lays out some solid facts. He tweeted: Trump used his fame to speak out on issues years before he ran 4 office. why was he allowed & Ms Streep should keep quiet? no hypocrisy please. trump used his fame to speak out on issues years before he ran 4 office. why was he allowed & Ms Streep should keep quiet? no hypocrisy pls https://t.co/CrpSCREcrw  Ron Howard (@RealRonHoward) January 9, 2017Then when a troll responded:@RealRonHoward It would be nice if Streep had any idea of the facts!

Fiat Chrysler called out his bullshit.On Monday morning, Trump posted on Twitter that Fiat Chrysler announced the creation of 2,000 jobs and a $1 billion investment in new factories in Michigan and Ohio and appeared to suggest that he is responsible for making it happen.It s finally happening   Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants, adding 2000 jobs. This after  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford & Fiat C!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017But as usual, Trump is trying to make himself look like a middle class hero by taking credit for something that he had nothing to do with.As it turns out, Fiat Chrysler had this plan in the works long before Election Day when they announced it a year ago because they noticed a demand for more trucks and SUVs in the United States.According to ThinkProgress,The company started following through in July of last year. It announced at that time that it would invest more than $1 billion in plants in Illinois and Ohio, adding new 1,000 jobs; and $1.5 billion in a Michigan plant, adding 700 jobs.Monday s announcement, therefore, is the second phase in this process and a confirmation of these ongoing plans , [c]onsistent and combined with previously announced investments,  as the company put it. This plan was in the works back in 2015,  Jodi Tinson, a spokeswoman for FCA, told ThinkProgress.  This announcement was just final confirmation. When asked directly if it was true that politics and the election had no influence on the announcement, she said,  Correct. Furthermore, if any president can take credit for this it s President Obama, who oversaw the bailout of the U.S. auto industry that included Fiat teaming up with the United Auto Workers and both the Canadian and American government to co-own Chrysler to rescue the company after it declared bankruptcy in 2009.Since then, Fiat built the company back up and bought out the UAW and U.S.-Canadian partners to gain sole ownership in 2014 after investing $9.6 billion in American facilities while creating 25,000 jobs since 2009.So Trump is taking credit for an accomplishment by Fiat that was made possible under President Obama s guidance and leadership at a time when the auto industry in this country was set to collapse because of economic policies Republicans had pursued for decades, the same policies Trump wants to bring back.And you can bet that Trump won t be taking credit when industries start to fail under his incompetent administration.

But if Trump has his way, the NNSA will not be able to do these things.In the past, presidential appointees to posts like the NNSA have traditionally been held until after the new president appoints and the Senate confirms their replacement. Such a tradition ensures that the government is still working even during a transition of power.But according to Gizmodo,Trump, however, appears determined to immediately push out everyone who was appointed by Obama, regardless of whether or not he has anyone in line for the job. Or, as our source put it:  It s a shocking disregard for process and continuity of government. Just as with Obama s soon-to-be-removed international envoys, Trump has ordered Under Secretary for Nuclear Security Frank Klotz and his deputy, Madelyn Creedon both Obama appointees to leave their posts, even if it means no one is in charge of maintaining the country s nuclear weapons. According to our Energy Department source, Trump s team has yet to nominate anyone to succeed them. Since both positions require Senate confirmation, if could be months before their chairs are filled. And the vacancies may extend beyond the leadership roles.And because Klotz and Creedon are the only ones in the NNSA who can present a budget to Congress, it means the agency could end up without leadership and funding to do what it is supposed to do until Trump and the Senate do their jobs, and that could take months.An Energy Department source told Gizmodo that,  I m more and more coming around to the idea that we re so very very fucked. Donald Trump is putting our nation at risk by not observing the transition traditions that keep the government working efficiently and smoothly. He is apparently obsessed with ousting anyone who disagrees with him and anyone who was hired during the Obama Administration. But Republicans should remember that if they allow Trump to do this, they have no right to whine when Democrats do the exact same thing to conservatives in four years. Because then we ll see what taking out the trash really looks like.The fact that Trump is literally willing to weaken the effectiveness of our government and endanger our national security with his pettiness is frightening.

But Donald Trump, a guy who was born a millionaire, attended a private military school, and lives in a gold-plated penthouse, does.Tomi seemed to miss the part where Meryl Streep named a plethora of celebrities in the room and paid tribute to their humble backgrounds   the backgrounds they had before they made it big. Isn t that what conservatives claim to fight for? One s ability to rise from the bottom to the top through hard work?I guess it only counts if you re, say, Scott Baio or Ted Nugent.Lahren then went off on a Twitter tangent accusing Hollywood liberals of being  snowflakes  even though Lahren was the one who was triggered by Streep s  insults. Then there s Meghan McCain, another blonde mouthpiece:This Meryl Streep speech is why Trump won. And if people in Hollywood don t start recognizing why and how   you will help him get re-elected  Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) January 9, 2017Again, this conservative seems to miss the point: Streep advocated for respect, free speech and a free press. So is McCain   who s a member of the press   insinuating that that the tenets that Streep is fighting for is what got Trump elected? Because if that s so (which it isn t), McCain missed the entire point of the speech (hint: she did).Perhaps Meghan would have felt differently if Streep brought up how Trump mocked her dad for being a POW.And, in all honesty, if Streep s speech was that traumatic that it drives right-wingers to the polls, they are way more fragile than the  snowflakes  Tomi Lahren decries.Democrats get called  baby killers  all the time by the right yet we move on and actually get stuff done, not complain on Twitter.Radio host Tim Young had this to say:Sorry Meryl Streep fans, there s nothing brave about a privileged millionaire white woman pandering to you and a room of her liberal friends  Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) January 9, 2017Sorry, Tim, there s nothing admirable or acceptable about a billionaire orange man mocking  disabled person to pander to poorly-educated voters.Conservatives are mad that a Hollywood entertainer called a fellow Hollywood entertainer. They can t slam Streep for being a member of Hollywood without looking like a bunch of hypocritical fools.Tonight exposed the right as the overly PC, overly sensitive hypocrites we always knew them to be.Simply put, conservatives were triggered. Someone dared to call out and challenge their dear leader, and they don t know how to react. Perhaps these commentators are in need of a safe space?

She like so many is using her platform to speak out against this immoral, self-righteous demagogue.And without missing a beat, Steep warned:Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When the powerful use their platform to bully, we all lose.Again, without saying his name, Meryl Streep initiated a brutal, honest, and provocative takedown of the man slated to become President in less than two weeks.Calling on the press to be vigilant in their fight against Trump, Streep asked her fellow (and wealthy) actors and actresses to stand behind them, saying  We re going to need them, and they ll need us to safeguard the truth.

Of course, his plan failed but he never stopped the unprecedented obstruction, hissy fits, and utter disrespect towards President Obama and whatever policy ideas he proposed. Basically, if Obama suggested it, Republicans hated it, even if it was their idea originally, like the individual mandate in Obamacare.But now that Donald Trump is about to take over the White House due to help from the Russians, McConnell is whining because Democrats intend to show him what karma looks like.Last week, McConnell complained after Senate Democrats promised to block Trump s Supreme Court nominees, calling such a thing something that Americans won t tolerate. Except that McConnell and Republicans blocked President Obama s Supreme Court nominee for nearly a year until the nomination recently expired. But now Republicans all of a sudden expect Democrats to kiss Trump s ass.And McConnell demonstrated his hypocrisy again on Sunday during an interview with Face The Nation host John Dickerson.The Office of Government Ethics recently sounded the alarm that they are being pressured to  rush  Trump s cabinet picks through a system of checks that McConnell himself insisted upon in 2009, such as financial disclosures, tax returns, and background checks, when President Obama made his cabinet picks. But now McConnell is pretending that Republicans treated President Obama with nothing but deference and respect and said that Democrats should treat Trump the same way and resorted to using petty insults.The Democrats are really frustrated that they lost the election,  McConnell said. We confirmed seven Cabinet appointments the day President Obama was sworn in. We didn t like most of them, either. But he won the election. So all of these little procedural complaints are related to their frustration at having not only lost the White House, but having lost the Senate. I understand that. But we need to, sort of, grow up here and get past that. Here s the video via VidMe.Funny, I seem to remember Republicans leaving countless federal and judicial positions unfilled because they pledged to make President Obama fail. And to this day hundreds of positions remain unfilled all because Republicans hated that a black guy was elected president.McConnell insisted on these rules being followed in 2009, so he must follow his own rules. But it gets even worse for McConnell when you consider that his wife has been nominated to be Secretary of Transportation, so one wonders what McConnell wants to desperately hide so much that he now thinks it s no big deal to skip procedure.Seriously, Democrats should declare war on Trump in a way that makes the Republican war against President Obama look like a sissy fight. Turnabout is fair play, after all, and if anyone deserves to be obstructed and blocked, it s Donald Trump.

He had already started preparing for his role in the ceremonies, saying he was told he wouldn t be involved in an email.  At first I was destroyed,  he said, according to D.C. s ABC affiliate, WJLA.  I ve been doing this for 60 years. That s eleven inaugurations for which he s worked. At 89, he might be old, but he s still healthy and apparently still perfectly able to do this, given that he was already preparing.The Presidential Inauguration Committee issued a statement that said: Since 1957, millions of Americans and countless entertainers have come to recognize Charlie Brotman as the voice of the inaugural parade. The Presidential Inaugural Committee will be proud to honor Charlie as Announcer Chairman Emeritus on January 20th. We are thrilled for Steve Ray to be introducing a new generation of Americans to the grand traditions of the inaugural parade. That s not the same as having him actually do it, and he s weighing whether to even accept that, or the VIP seat he s been offered.

Did he tell the inauguration committee to find someone who had worked for him? Did he tell them that he knew Ray and that Ray should do the announcing?Brotman believes it s more likely ageism at work: Maybe they re afraid I might drop dead at the mic. Right now, nobody s really explaining this decision. Regardless, unlike Trump, who s petty and childish as all fuck and would scream about betrayal on Twitter while wishing for his replacement to fall flat on their face, Brotman wishes Ray no ill-will.

Naturally, Republicans will use these facts to somehow smear the liberal state as being one that exhibits the most gun violence around   even though red states produce more gun violence per capita than blue.Surprisingly, what many people may not know   and what they won t hear on Fox News   is that California has experienced a sharp decline in gun violence over the last 20 years, putting a fatal dent in the right s scare tactics when it comes to guns and the Second Amendment.Gavin Newsome, California s current Lieutenant Governor, recently spoke at a press conference regarding Prop 63, which limited magazine sizes, banned the sale of assault weapons, and conducted background checks on ammunition sales. It passed on election day by an overwhelming margin. During this press conference, Newsome pointed to a very interesting statistic: since California began passing stricter gun laws in the 1990s, the state has seen a staggering 56 percent drop in gun homicides.Now, those were Gavin Newsome s numbers, and they took into account gun violence rate. If you look at the numbers from Center for Disease Control, between 1993 and 2014 (Newsome s numbers did not include 2014), the rate for murder rate has actually fallen 67 percent, from 9.60 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 3.14 per 100,000 in 2014. The data for 2015 and 2016 are still being collected, and have not been factored into Newsome s or the CDC s report.Whereas the state s gun laws may or may not be directly responsible   gun rights groups and gun control groups of course have differing opinions, naturally   it remains that the talking point  more gun control harms citizens  has been proven effectively false, in California of all places.It looks like the good guys with the guns may not be stopping the bad guys with the guns. Because guns have increasingly been hard to come by in he state, a trickle effect has been felt.While red states like Louisiana continue to top the list for gun murder and violence, blue states like California have taken action, and are literally saving lives in the process.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Sean Spicer is the former communications man for the Republican National Committee. He will also be joining the communications team for the upcoming Trump Administration, and he is getting a head start by stoking the fires of Trump s ongoing feud with the press. Speaking with The Hill, Spicer whined about how the media treats Trump. He began: There s some positive aspects here and there, but largely it still continues to not treat him with the respect that he deserves. I think for a lot of folks inside the beltway, and inside pundit-world, they don t fully appreciate the understanding that he has of where the American people are. They continue to mock him in ways, when it frankly just shows the lack of understanding that they have of where the American people are and what they think. Spicer then went on to whine about the positive coverage of Democrats in the press, saying: There are countless examples of the media engaging   overtly or covertly   cheering on Democrats and there s no accountability. But it s also not even frowned upon. The thing is, though, the press realizes what the Republican Party doesn t, which is that Trump is a petty, vengeful, lying, unqualified, corrupt Russian stooge who has duped just enough Americans in the right states to be elected president. That does not mean that he is deserving of respect, though. In fact, respect is earned, not given, and Trump has shown the media zero respect. Rightfully, they are giving it back in kind. He has not earned their respect, and therefore should not expect them to roll over and give it to him.Spicer then went on to give the press another reason to be frustrated with Trump, saying that the White House press briefings that they   and the American people   have become so accustomed to might not be the same in a Trump White House: It will be a daily something. When I say  something,  maybe it s a gaggle, maybe it s an on-camera briefing. Maybe we solicit talk radio and regional newspapers to submit questions   because they can t afford to be in Washington   but they still have a question. Maybe we just let the American people submit questions that we read off as well. This is most definitely vague, and when it comes to vague with Team Trump, that is an ominous sign, most likely.Spicer then said that he had spoken with former White House press secretaries, from both major parties, and said of them: Whether Republican or Democrat, every one of these predecessors has been unbelievably generous with their time, counsel and advice. The respect for the institution is one that is shared by all of them. Speaking of former Bill Clinton White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry s saying that perhaps these briefings should no longer be televised, Spicer said: I think his conclusion   his points are right. The second the cameras come on it becomes more of a show than an attempt to be more informative. So, in other words, they want to cut the American people off from knowing the day to day workings of our own government. The talk then turned to Trump s insistence on using Twitter for insults, policy announcements, and everything in between. Many Americans   including Trump s own supporters   believe he needs to stay off Twitter. Spicer, however, scoffed at this notion: I think this is nonsense. I really do. Because at the end of the day the American people want more than anything else is results. And success. And he s delivering already. And I think the American people   the people who have their jobs because of his actions   the taxpayers who have watched him save tax dollars, are appreciative, and I m not too sure they re concerned with the means by which he achieves that. So, in other words, we can look forward to the Tweeter-in-Chief. We already knew that, though. Spicer ended his remarks with words of caution to the press: Journalists and everyone in America has a Constitutional right to express themselves or write what they want to write. But he equally has a right to make sure that the record is set straight, the facts are known, and that people can t just take potshots without being held accountable. So, this war with the media will continue for the next four years. Considering Trump s thin-skinned, vengeful, vindictive nature, this could mean that he and his sycophants use the bully pulpit of the White House to bully journalists and dismantle the First Amendment.

Through propaganda and documents stolen from the DNC, Russia gave Trump information that he encouraged them to search for all while withholding information hacked from the RNC.The information went to Wikileaks, which published it, and Trump repeatedly cited Wikileaks on the campaign trail.During an interview on CNN, Tapper confronted Trump mouthpiece Kellyanne Conway with video of Trump using what Wikileaks provided to attack Hillary Clinton, clearly demonstrating that Trump benefited from Russian espionage. If you listen to what Mr. Trump had to say on the stump all the time, he invoked Wikileaks dozens and dozens of times to try to suggest that the Wikileaks said that there were things that Hillary Clinton was doing or had done that were untoward,  Tapper began. So I guess what I m confused about is how can you say that the hacking had no impact on the election when Mr. Trump kept invoking Wikileaks, which was printing, publishing things that the Russians had hacked?  he continued.  Obviously he thought it was going to have an effect on the election. Faced with the reality that Trump opened his mouth a lot on camera, Conway tried to downplay the seriousness of the breach. Well, it had an effect on his debate answer and it had an effect on the Clinton campaign because it was quite embarrassing to watch her closest advisers question her judgment and question whether she would ever find her voice and wondering allowed why she was testing 84 slogans to find out who she was and what she had won on. This guy had  make America great again  and never change. That s very embarrassing, them calling Chelsea Clinton, a spoiled brat. That s very uncomfortable but that s what was hacked. But why invoke all those Wikileaks that were the work of Russian intelligence,  Tapper asked again, refusing to let Conway bullshit her way out of answering the question.Conway then claimed that Trump didn t know who the source of the hacks was at the time, which is a lie because Trump was asked to address the hacking in July and he asks the Russian to keep doing it.Once again, Tapper nailed Conway to the wall with the facts. But you are trying to change public impressions of Hillary Clinton, right?  Tapper asked.  Mr. Trump and you and others were trying to make an argument against Hillary Clinton using the work of Wikileaks. And Conway responded by claiming that Trump was going to win whether Russia and Wikileaks helped him or not. And we all know that is complete bullshit.Here s the video via VidMe.The fact is that Russia helped Donald Trump smear Hillary Clinton with lies and he is an illegitimate president-elect because of it.

Well, it seems that there are some highly respected people who realize this, and hopefully they can keep us all safe during this travesty of a presidency. One such person is national security expert and former intelligence officer Malcolm Nance.Nance sat down for a chat with MSNBC s Joy Reid on Saturday morning, and he did not mince words when it came to the dangers of Trump, and what he believes the incoming president-elect strongman has in store for America s top spy agencies. First, Reid began: Let s just get to Donald Trump s refusal to be able to accept, Malcolm, the conclusions of the intelligence community even when the head of the intelligence agencies are sitting in front of him telling him this happened. Why in your view will he not just accept it? Nance s reply was most ominous: I think because, when Donald Trump made his statement on July 27th of last year where he asked for Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and release her e-mails, at that point he went from being an unwitting useful idiot to Russia to actually believing that they were working in his favor. To admit that now, in the face of all the evidence, he would believe that this would delegitimize his presidency and he will fight to the end to not allow this to become a narrative. Of course he will. It s a telltale trait of people with authoritarian tendencies to be unable to have their legitimacy questioned for any reason whatsoever. Trump will stop at nothing to prevent the media from talking about this. Hell, given his constant attacks on them, he may even try to use the power of the presidency to prohibit there being any sort of check on him for any reason, but especially when it comes to Russia.Nance continued: I suspect that in two weeks he s going to attempt to cover this all up and even gut the intelligence community. He is pushing this nation to a constitutional crisis of unprecedented magnitude, because no one has ever worked in the interests of a hostile nation and supporting, to a certain extent, a hostile intelligence service. Nance is exactly right. Trump is dangerous. He is looking to serve his own interests, not those of the United States of America. Should he continue along this path   and we know that he will   the people in a position of power to do something about him better damn well do it fast, lest he shred the Constitution and destroy American democracy forever.Watch the video below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""As we get ready for the most bigotry-fueled, racist, misogynistic administration in the modern history of the United States, the Republican Party is already setting its sights on robbing people of their human rights. Knowing full well that President-elect Donald Trump shares their values (or lack of), the GOP has already announced their plan to defund Planned Parenthood, and Democrats across the country are organizing to stop them.Perhaps the most perfect takedown of this plan we ve seen so far comes from New Jersey s Senator Cory Booker, who was a massive supporter of Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign. During a press conference this week, Booker absolutely tore into the GOP while showing us all how to resist and stand up to such a hateful movement. Here s what Booker said, and it should be shared with every single pro-life (or really, pro-birth) Republican you know: So, I don t have a message for fellow Republican elected, because they re not depending on Planned Parenthood in their neighborhoods. They re well paid comfortable people. I have a message for every American, Democrat, and Republican who rely on these services or know people that do, or have the kind of heart to care enough to stand up for the women that receive these services. Booker called out New Jersey governor Chris Christie and reminded the GOP that there are very real, very serious consequences for defunding such a critical organization: I saw what happened when Chris Christie in my state cut the funding to Planned Parenthood. I saw in poor neighborhoods doors being shut, hours being constricted. Then, Booker pointed out exactly why resisting the defunding of Planned Parenthood is crucial, and how he plans to help lead the fight: This is a moment in America. Republicans now think they re elected with a mandate to do these kind of things. I saw just this week the craven overreach of the Republican Party when they tried the Republican GOP to gut Independent Ethics Oversight. And what we saw there was the American people standing up and saying  We will not tolerate this!  and so this is another point.We see that they will listen if enough people stand up and fight!And so this is the first shot in what is going to be a battle leading into real reconciliation. And if enough Americans stand up and say we re not going to tolerate this. We didn t elect anybody to rip out the key preventive services to make it harder to be someone struggling in this country to get basic healthcare services, that I believe in women, that I believe fundamentally in this country and that institutions like this make a stronger, better, more intelligent, more compassionate, more loving.And so frankly, what I m going to be doing   every single day now leading the group reconciliations   is trying to wake up the conscience of other folks, trying to call to people to protest, to fight, to stand up. Because this cannot be allowed to happen. Too many people will suffer. The consequences will be felt by all. Booker s powerful words could not have come at a better time, as the GOP has made targeting Planned Parenthood one of their first priorities.

But Bannon s propaganda rag recently demonstrated some behavior that most of us find cringeworthy (while Trump and friends are surely cheering) when they decided a story about a small fireworks fire needed a bit of spice.According to Breitbart in a story headlined  Revealed: 1,000-man mob attack police, set Germany s oldest church alight on New Year s Eve,  a crowd of  at least 1,000 young  Muslim  men  began throwing fireworks into a crowd of families with children before setting fire to a church.

They explain that Wolf took numerous unconnected incidents, exaggerated them, and threw them together with the sole purpose of creating a false image of Muslims as terrorists.This Breitbart story has even prompted the justice minister of the Hesse state, Eva K hne-H rmann, to warn that the danger is that these stories spread with incredible speed and take on lives of their own.

They are the richest of the rich, the lowest of the low, and the most corrupt of the corrupt. Republicans are fully aware of this but they plan to push them through without even completing the vetting process and a federal watchdog just called them out on their shady scheme.According to the Washington Post, the head of the Office of Government Ethics penned a letter to Democratic Senators on Saturday, which warns that Republicans are planning to hold confirmation hearings on Trump s nominees before the necessary paperwork has even been done  to ensure there are no ethical, financial or criminal concerns. Walter M. Shaub Jr., the ethics director, said the idea that the GOP intends to hold confirmation hearings without an ethics review is of great concern to me. The Post reports:Plans for at least seven Trump nominees to sit for hearings on Capitol Hill in the coming days have  created undue pressure on OGE s staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews,  Shaub wrote.  More significantly, it has left some of the nominees with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues shortly before their scheduled hearings. Shaub added:  I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process. The letter gives even more firepower to concerned Democrats who say the GOP is trying to rush Trump s cabinet picks through. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) says the letter  makes crystal-clear that the transition team s collusion with Senate Republicans to jam through these Cabinet nominees before they ve been thoroughly vetted is unprecedented. The Senate and the American people deserve to know that these Cabinet nominees have a plan to avoid any conflicts of interest, that they re working on behalf of the American people and not their own bottom line, and that they plan to fully comply with the law. Senate Republicans should heed the advice of this independent office and stop trying to jam through unvetted nominees. Among Trump s top picks scheduled for confirmation hearings this week are Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump s racist choice to serve as attorney general, and Rex Tillerson, the former ExxonMobil chief executive that Trump has nominated as secretary of state.It is unclear what effect, if any, the concerns of the ethics office will have on the confirmation of Trump s cabinet picks but it could make it more difficult for Republicans to simply wave them through without objection. Hearings are scheduled to take place on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Republicans are lying when they claim to be  fiscally conservative,  and Donald Trump s wall proves it.Throughout the campaign, the central promise Trump made to his supporters was that he would build a massive wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and force Mexico to pay for it.And then one day during the home-stretch of the 2016 Election, Trump slipped up by admitting that American taxpayers would be paying the price tag and immediately followed up by claiming that Mexico will  reimburse  us for the cost.Well, that cost is estimated to be $25 million or more and Donald Trump is now asking Republicans in Congress to pass funding for the wall, all while continuing to insist that Mexico will pay the United States back.Apparently, Trump and Republicans want to start with $10 billion. Keep in mind that these are the same Republicans who claimed to be worried about the national debt and frequently obstructed every piece of legislation they could over the last six years because they complained it cost too much or was a waste of taxpayer dollars.Clearly, Republicans only think it s waste of taxpayer dollars when Democrats try to pass something and are only  concerned  about the deficit and debt when Democrats are in charge. But they have absolutely no problem blowing up the debt and spending like drunken sailors when they are in power.And Joy Reid along with fiscal conservative political journalist Josh Barro, nailed Republicans for being complete hypocrites. Today, the president-elect got slightly more detailed about who will actually pay for the wall and, surprise, it s you!  Reid began.Reid pointed out that Republicans are stuck between a rock and a hard place because they are now faced with angering Trump s racist supporters if they don t fund the wall, or angering the American people by wasting taxpayer dollars and revealing themselves to be  fiscally conservative  hypocrites.Josh Barro agreed. It starts adding up to real money, a billion here, a billion there,  he said.  It s something that ends up being a non-trivial item in the federal budget if we foot the bill for it. I think they have to be worried in both directions! If they try to not appropriate the money to build the wall they could be attacked in the primary but if they do go along with spending what ends up being $20 billion or whatever on this wall, that s something they can be attacked for in the general election. Here s the video via VidMe.And it would, indeed, be American taxpayers who get stuck with the bill. Because Mexico has repeatedly declared that they are not going to pay one dime for Trump s wall. And such a wall would STILL not stop immigrants from crossing the border. Even the Berlin wall built by the Russians to keep East Germans from crossing over to West Berlin did not stop people from getting across, and that barrier was 12 to 15 feet in height made of concrete and boasted border guards and tanks prepared to kill anyone who dared try to escape. It even included  subsidiary walls, trenches, electric fences and an open  death strip  overseen by armed guards in 302 watchtowers. Plus, the Berlin Wall was only 97 miles long. The southern border between Mexico and the United States, however, is nearly 2,000 miles long and Trump claims his wall will only need to cover 1,000 miles of it. And that means it will be far more expensive than the Berlin Wall and would be far less effective unless Trump and the Republicans are proposing to militarize the wall like the Soviets did to the Berlin Wall. Of course, that would only make the cost skyrocket even higher and hurt America s image as a beacon of freedom.The bottom line is that Trump s wall is a money pit that will drain our resources and do nothing to curtail immigration. It will be useless and give America a black eye because we would be compared to the Soviet Union. And while that might be fine with Trump and his buddy Vladimir Putin, it won t be fine with a majority of the American people who still believe in our constitutional values.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Firstly, it s an expensive endeavor, one that is expected to cost up to $38 billion. And Mexico will not pay for it. We will. Taxpayers will be footing the bill for his wall. Yet, the president-elect now says that it will be built, and Mexico will pay for it later. And now, even Republicans know that he s full of it.A number of Republicans interviewed by CNN suggested that Trump s claim amounted to wishful thinking, saying they believe the alleged billionaire would ultimately backtrack on one of his central campaign promises. I doubt that they re going to pay for it,  said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch.  There s a lot he could do if he wanted to (force Mexico s hand). In all honesty, I don t think that s going to happen. Rep. Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, said,  I never thought that would happen. I thought it was a gimmick. Trump will face a backlash if he fails to keep his promise. I m for building a wall,  said Rep. Mo Brooks.  And I m for Donald Trump keeping his promise to the American people that Mexico pay for it.  The Alabama lawmaker added that that he would be  disappointed  if Trump failed to deliver.Oh, those crazy  fiscal conservatives. :House GOP sources tell CNN that Trump s transition team has urged Republican leaders to include funding for the wall in a spending package that must pass by April 28 in order to keep the government open. The price tag is uncertain, but some similar proposals have been projected to cost upwards of $10 billion. We re going to get reimbursed,  Trump told The New York Times.  But I don t want to wait that long. But you start, and then you get reimbursed. Sure we will, Sport. Just like his contractors were reimbursed while still waiting for that check that will never happen.Mexico will not pay for the wall. Hillary Clinton will not be locked up.

Russia s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence.Moscow s approach evolved over the course of the campaign based on Russia s understanding of the electoral prospects of the two main candidates. When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency.Trump has once again proven himself to be an imbecile who isn t qualified to run a banana stand let alone the country.

Trump has expressed a desire to simply move on past this important, unprecedented development, and has consistently cast doubt on the conclusions reached by multiple intelligence agencies, including the CIA and FBI.His inner circle has already floated the idea of a reorganization at the CIA, which could be seen as a sort of punishment for reaching a conclusion about foreign election interference that is embarrassing for Trump.Now it appears that he wants to act vindictively towards the other end of the information pipeline, in a dangerous step that could threaten the rights of every American. Trump is now making noise about having Congress go after news outlets who reported on what the agencies said.President-elect Donald Trump s call for a congressional investigation into leaks of a national security briefing suggests he s ready to carry his war with the media into the White House.The Washington Post and NBC News, citing a briefing on the hacking of Democratic Party officials, reported Thursday that Russian officials celebrated Trump s election. Later that day, Trump asked on Twitter how NBC got  an exclusive look into the top secret report he (Obama) was presented?  On Friday, he added:  I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it. Trump s rhetoric brings to mind President Nixon, who infamously kept an  enemies list  which included news outlets and personalities who had offended him in some way. He even ordered government wiretaps and surveillance of the journalists he felt were against him, in behavior lacking all respect for the First Amendment guarantee to a free press.Trump has consistently antagonized the independent press, holding them up as an object of hate and derision at his campaign rallies and egging his rabid supporters on when they have directed threats towards the media. Trump duplicates much of that behavior online, directing pro-Trump online mobs to mobilize against voices that have simply reported on corruption and dirty dealings surrounding the man some have described as their  god emperor. Using the power of government to go after speech   not illegal leaking of classified data but most likely information authorized by government officials to be delivered to the press   is a dangerous step, and one Trump seems ready to take to defend his wounded ego.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

During an interview with Anderson Cooper and guest Robert Reich, Lord killed everyone s brain cells with his moronic defense of Trump.Lord not only tried to convince everyone that Trump hadn t been dismissive to the intelligence community (one only needs to look through Trump s Twitter feed to know that s false), but he accused the intelligence community of  attacking  Trump! As soon as Lord stated that Trump hasn t been disagreeing with the CIA and NSA, Reich jumped in and corrected him. Reich said: I mean, Donald Trump has said that he disagrees with the intelligence agencies, the FBI, the CIA, the NSA. He has disparaged them publicly. He has also disparaged other sources of facts such as the media and science. Scientists who talk about global climate change. Donald Trump doesn t want to hear anything he doesn t want to hear. And to disparage the intelligence community when he is going to have to rely on the intelligence community, it seems to me is the height of arrogance and very dangerous. Where is Donald Trump getting his facts from if he is not getting them from the intelligence community? Does a separate root of facts? A separate source of facts? Reich then pointed out,  How can you run a government if you re going to be disparaging all your sources of information? Lord lied and said Trump was  a fan  of the intelligence community. He said: I don t think he is disparaging the men and women who put their lives on the line to do this. That s not Donald Trump at all. But I think he is right to question the leadership. To be perfectly candid. Then, Lord said something that was so foolish, Reich s brain nearly melted when he heard it. Lord said,  They re going to attack him anonymously in the press. They ll attack through their allies on Capitol Hill. Reich could hardly find the words. He tried to compose himself as he asked: The CIA and NSA are going to attack Donald Trump? Is that what you re alleging? Wait a minute, wait a minute. I want to understand something. You re saying that there is a conspiracy of some sort, that you have all the intelligence agencies Congress conspiring and they ll try to bring Donald Trump down? Is this the assumption here? Lord failed to provide a suitable answer, and Reid continued to ask,  But why is it appropriate for somebody who is president-elect to undercut, disparage, demean the intelligence agencies, just as he does the media, just as he does independent scientists and government scientists?

Not only was the Iraq war one of the most fiscally and internationally irresponsible moves the George W. Bush administration could have made, it was based on lies and, as the CIA just confirmed, a political agenda.As recently as a year ago, polls were conducted that said that more than half of Americans still believe the lie that Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11. He wasn t. The success of that massive lie is no doubt what led us to the fact free world which gave us Donald Trump.Instead of waiting to gather all the intelligence, according to the CIA, the Bush administration was fully committed to pulling the trigger immediately following the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.Discussing the first days of the Bush administration on BBC Radio 4 s Today Programme, (former CIA analyst John) Nixon said:  We had gotten word that they saw Iraq as  unfinished business . We never really understood at that point what unfinished business meant, but we knew that they wanted to do something. He added:  You know, they had their minds made up from day one. And then after 9/11, that s when the death warrant for Saddam Hussein was signed. Source: IndependentNixon didn t offer any speculation as to why Bush had it in for Hussein, but a number of explanations have been floated, such as it was (as Nixon seems to imply) the younger Bush finishing what his father started when the George Bush Sr. invaded Iraq. Another possible explanation is even worse. It s war profiteering, plain and simple. It s also highly likely that it was both. The bottom line, though, is that we never should have been in Iraq and that was a giant failing of not just Washington, but of our media.

But by defunding the organization, Republicans would be stripping millions of low income women of vital healthcare services such as breast cancer exams, PAP smears, and contraceptives that would prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place. Do people still not have their facts straight about who s going to actually be affected by Planned Parenthood s removal?  Goldberg began.  There is no line item in the federal budget that goes to Planned Parenthood. No tax dollars. Can we just say that again? Because the myth of federal tax dollars for abortions has been discredited, we ve said it a million times, all those videos you keep seeing have been discredited. The videos Goldberg is talking about, which she later correctly labeled as  bullshit,  are the deceptively edited videos illegally recorded by anti-abortion fanatics to try and portray Planned Parenthood as a profiteer off abortions. In reality, Planned Parenthood does not profit off of fetal tissue. The organization merely gets reimbursed the cost of shipping from medical and scientific organizations and facilities who need the tissue for research. The only people who are going to eat it when Planned Parenthood goes away are women who need the services,  Goldberg continued.Bila jumped to defend conservatives by whining about how  religious  people don t want their tax dollars going to an organization they don t agree with. And then she had the gall to claim that conservatives don t have a problem with women choosing to have an abortion, which we all know is bullshit considering all the anti-abortion laws conservatives have been pushing for over the years.Apparently it s not, because If it was my right, you wouldn t give a crap whether I was having an abortion,  Goldberg fired back.  Whether you subscribe to people having abortions or not should have nothing to do with what I do or what I need. If I m a low-income person and I ve been raped you don t have the right to tell me if I should have an abortion. And then Goldberg dropped the hammer on Bila by telling her that if conservatives don t want their tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood, then she doesn t want her tax dollars going to paying for Trump s wall. Look, I don t want to pay for this new wall that suddenly we are now paying for. My religious background says that I m supposed to make sure that people are serviced, that s what my religion says. I m not there to judge. God judges. I m paying for stuff I don t want to pay for, she added.  I don t want to pay for a wall My thing about America is that people have to pay their fair share for things they don t like and things they do like. You may not like abortion don t have one. Here s the video via YouTube.And Goldberg is absolutely right. After all, taxpayers were forced by Republicans to pay for abstinence-only sex education programs that don t work, not to mention costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and let s go ahead and include the salaries of every Republicans who sat on their ass and did nothing but obstruct over the last eight years instead of helping President Obama rebuild America. I m sure many taxpayers object to their money being used for that as well.The fact is, however, that Planned Parenthood provides healthcare services to millions of low-income women across the country and only 3 percent of those services has to do with abortion. And if Republicans really care about women, they ll stop trying to take their healthcare provider away from them.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Chicago police aren t sure if it was politically motivated,  Lahren claimed.  Are you freaking kidding me? This is the definition of a hate crime, and these four sick individuals deserve a seat on death row right next to Dylann Roof. And Lahren totally lost all credibility right there with that single statement. In her mind, a white teen who lived through a beating is worth nine black people who were murdered. Basically, she is saying one white life is worth nine black lives. And the white teen survived. Plus, she thinks the four black suspects should be sentenced to death. Again, while their actions are horrible, we don t sentence people to death for committing assault. Nor do we sentence people to death for kidnapping. If they had murdered the victim, Lahren would have a case for putting the death penalty on the table. But they didn t.Then Lahren went on to question parenting in inner cities, which is her code for black people. Times like these, we have to wonder, where are the parents? Not just (Wednesday), but when these four were growing up? Because the breakdown of the American family has left young people   especially in the inner cities   with no role models. That s why they turn to celebrities and rap stars who chant  eff Trump  for guidance and leadership. Seriously, only racists like Lahren push these stereotypes about black people. And then she whined and claimed that if the disabled man had been black and the suspects were white it would have been a bigger story. If the race roles were reversed here, can you imagine the coverage? The race of the assailants would be plastered on every headline from here to Timbuktu, but if it doesn t fit the race-baiting agenda of the left and their cohorts in the mainstream, it doesn t quite get the same attention. If this thing wasn t paraded on Facebook Live, the mainstream would have likely diluted, dismissed or outright ignored it,  she said.  If it bleeds, it leads   but only if it s the right color, huh? Except the media widely covered this story across the nation and both President Obama and Black Lives Matter even condemned the actions of these four individuals.Here s the video via Facebook.Predictably, the racists were quick to chime in with their own comments.The bottom line here is that these four suspects should be punished for their crimes, which are inexcusable and indefensible. But Lahren should not have compared this incident to the mass shooting in Charleston. A brutal beating is nowhere near as bad a crime as nine counts of murder. She should apologize for that and to the families of the victims she just insulted.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

After all, he has maintained for months that he had secret information that proves Vladimir Putin s gang didn t hack his political enemies for him. He has repeatedly attacked our intelligence agencies for bringing it to light. As ABC reports, the proof that Trump was lying to the American people is quite strong:Overnight   just hours after President Barack Obama received the report   new details emerged of just what is contained in the secret document.A senior official briefed on the intelligence sources, methods and assessments in the report that Trump will receive this morning told ABC News that the findings are clear: the evidence points directly to the Kremlin and to Russian President Vladimir Putin in what one official described as  multiple streams and types of intelligence collection, not just forensic examinations of the hacked systems.  Those various streams of information gathered by U.S. spy agencies include signals intelligence such as intercepts of communications between Russian officials in which they implicated the Kremlin s own espionage, as ABC News reported last month.The Washington Post reported late on Thursday that the eavesdropping caught senior Russian officials actually cheering Trump s surprise victory in November as a success of the Kremlin s intelligence program.And Vice President Joe Biden   who was privy to the classified briefing that Trump will receive today   told the PBS NewsHour that,  there s overwhelming consensus in the community and overwhelming evidence supplied by the community that Russia did engage in an effort to impact on the elections. There is clear evidence that they in fact were engaged in activities designed to try and impact in the outcome of the election,  Biden said, while noting there was  no evidence that they actually tampered with voting booths or tampered with voting rolls. Referring to parts of the report which will be made public next week, Biden said:  It will state clearly that the Russians did as a matter of policy  attempt to  discredit the US electoral process  and  attempt to hurt Mrs. Clinton. Contrary to Trump s public bloviations Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, says that the attacks were approved at the highest level of government in Russia    and by that, he means that  the highest is President Putin.

Most particularly, the hackers went after John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton 2016 campaign and long-time Clinton ally. After they got into his emails, they passed them along to the team at WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks is headed by Julian Assange, who long has held a grudge against Sec. Clinton, President Obama, and the United States. The Podesta emails were then released by WikiLeaks and timed specifically to be repeatedly featured in national headlines for weeks on end.Those leaks were used by Trump and the Trump campaign as fodder for an effort to attack Clinton s character and honesty, which, when coupled with other campaign coverage and missteps, helped to hurt her approval ratings and votes.Despite these revelations, Trump has refused to accept the information as uncovered by the CIA and other agencies. Instead, Trump has sided with the Russian government and WikiLeaks over the U.S. government that he will lead in two weeks. He has blamed the Democrats for not making their servers secure enough, and even argued that couriers should be used instead of electronic communications.While some Republicans have bucked their party leader over Russian interference, and, along with Democrats, pushed the Senate to establish an independent investigation like those used with Watergate and Benghazi to look into Russian interference, the majority of Republicans have followed Trump in minimizing Russian interference, preferring instead to keep up attacks on Democrats.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And guess what? America is going to be paying for the entire thing.According to CNN, Trump and his team are planning to crawl to the Republican-controlled Congress to ask them to pay for it with money from taxpayers.President-elect Donald Trump s transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that the President-elect s preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials. The Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings they d like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said. We want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall,  Louisiana GOP Rep. Steve Scalise said.  We re in talks with him on the details of it as they re still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there s another funding bill that s going to move. We re going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall. In other words, Trump lied to his supporters when he said Mexico would be funding the wall, something he insisted upon because the American people would never have accepted having to pay for such an expensive venture themselves.After all, it s a waste of government funds that could be used to help pay for healthcare or other things America needs more than a wall that won t keep immigrants out.And this isn t the first time Trump slipped up on this issue.Last year, Trump made remarks about his immigration plan in which he said that America would pay for the construction of the wall before quickly adding that Mexico will be reimbursing America for the cost. The End Illegal Immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border,  Trump said.  Don t worry about it. Remember I said that Mexico is paying for the wall. With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall, okay? So, Donald Trump is actually making the American people pay for his costly wall. The rhetoric about making Mexico pay for it was just a lie designed to fool his supporters. They got duped because it will be their own tax dollars paying for it. And Republicans are going to just give him the money when he asks for it.Featured Image: Zach Gibson/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It s so bad that even a Fox News host called him out for siding with a hostile foreign government over U.S. intelligence agencies. And now, a former CIA director working on Trump s transition team has had it. He is done.The Washington Post reports:Former CIA director R. James Woolsey Jr., a veteran of four presidential administrations and one of the nation s leading intelligence experts, resigned Thursday from President-elect Donald Trump s transition team because of growing tensions over Trump s vision for intelligence agencies.Woolsey s resignation as a Trump senior adviser comes amid Trump s public comments undermining the intelligence community. Trump has publicly aligned himself with Russia over the U.S., even in his Twitter timeline. Effective immediately, Ambassador Woolsey is no longer a Senior Advisor to President-Elect Trump or the Transition. He wishes the President-Elect and his Administration great success in their time in office,  said Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey.According to those close to the former CIA director, Trump excluded him from discussions on intelligence matters in recent weeks, and that surprises no one considering that the president-elect routinely misses security briefings.According to those sources, Woolsey became increasingly uncomfortable to lend his name and credibility to the transition team without being consulted.The sources, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, said that Woolsey was taken aback by this week s reports that Trump is considering revamping the country s intelligence framework. Indeed, the president-elect is crafting plans to restructure at least two of the nation s top intelligence agencies. Jim is very uncomfortable being considered an adviser in an area where one might consider him an expert when he is not involved in the discussions,  according to one source.  To be called  senior adviser  and your opinion is not sought is something he cannot handle. The person close to Woolsey described him as having chafed at Trump s loose style on Twitter. They described Woolsey as a  very principled  diplomat who takes care to communicate the right message with just the right words.  This is a guy [for whom] commas, periods, etc., all have special meaning,  this person said.Trump s tweets are unnerving, and Woolsey knows it. It s horrifying to read the president-elect s tweets each day, proving once again that Americans elected an unfit candidate to lead the free world.But, Trump knows everything already.

The Hill reports that the situation is exactly as bad as was predicted by those  establishment stooges  who had the gall to vote for the woman who had the best chance to defeat Donald Trump, rather than sling diapers at the wall for almost a year and join in the propagation of untrue right-wing propaganda:Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that defunding Planned Parenthood will be included as part of a bill to repeal ObamaCare.Ryan said cutting off federal funds to the organization will be included in a  reconciliation  bill that also repeals the core of ObamaCare. The reconciliation process prevents Democrats from launching a filibuster against the measure, meaning Republicans won t need 60 votes to win on defunding. Planned Parenthood legislation will be in our reconciliation bill,  Ryan said, without providing any more details.Currently, Republicans would be hard-pressed to lay out any actual plan to replace Obamacare   because there isn t one. But that isn t stopping them from undoing the good work of Barack Obama s administration. Their goal over the next four years will not be to help you or anyone else. Their goal will be the same as it was when Obama was first elected   to erase the legacy of our first African-American President, and to undo any good that he has done. Isn t that, after all, the true meaning of  Make America Great Again?

They say it will force businesses to raise prices or lay off workers, but that s just simply not the case.In reality, the exact opposite happened. As it turns out, the minimum wage hike created a boom in business because workers had more money in their pockets to spend on things like pretzels. I was shocked,  Phelps told KQED during an interview about how the law has impacted business owners.  I was stunned by the business. In fact, Wetzel s Pretzels saw their profits increase significantly after each minimum wage increase, which now stands at $10.50 an hour in California. And the positive effect is being witnessed by franchise managers like Mike Jacobs. My overall sales were something like 15 percent ahead after the first minimum wage bump, and now they re about 12 percent ahead this year,  Jacobs said.  It isn t because I m such a great manager or smart guy, but the buying public has more money in their pocket. Here s the interview via KQED.But Donald Trump, his Labor Secretary pick Andrew Puzder, and the Republican-controlled Congress threaten all of that success.Trump has repeatedly flip-flopped when it comes to the minimum wage. He has called for it to be eliminated at the federal level, which would let Republicans drastically lower wages in states they control. He has said that he supports raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour, which would nearly match California. But Trump s choice of fast-food CEO Andrew Puzder as Labor Secretary makes it clear that he opposes minimum wage hikes. Trump and Puzder both wrongly believe that raising wages for American workers makes us unable to compete with foreign businesses.But that s a load of bullshit that corporate vultures like Trump spew as an excuse to manufacture their products in China and Mexico instead of paying American workers a fair wage to manufacture the products in the United States.The fact is that raising the minimum wage helps more people than it harms, but Puzder opposes the minimum wage and will be in a position to viciously attack it along with overtime pay rules and rules that require breaks for workers.So while business is booming in California because lawmakers there understand that paying workers more increases the amount of money people will pump back into the economy, Trump and Puzder will be working with Republicans to sabotage the economy by killing the minimum wage laws that made us an economic powerhouse in the first place.Featured image via Twitter ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They say they ve built a fail-safe in to protect those who may otherwise lose their insurance while they continue dilly-dallying on coming up with an actual replacement   delaying implementation of the repeal so they have time to develop their replacement (because the last six years apparently wasn t enough time).Here s a secret: Those people will probably lose their insurance anyway.And not just for the reasons we already know. One massive problem that s not really getting discussed is that Republicans   repeal and delay  tactic creates too much market uncertainty for risk-based insurance. Republicans have been sowing the seeds of uncertainty for a long time, and they re one of the big reasons insurers like United Healthcare began pulling out of the exchanges despite still raking in billions in net profits.J.B. Silvers, a former health insurance CEO, first explains this while describing the  risk corridor  program, which was supposed to help offset the risks insurers took when enrolling high-risk people in their programs. He then says: But when the time came to pay up for risk reduction in the Obamacare exchanges, Congress reneged and paid only 12 percent of what was owed to the insurers. So, on top of the fact that the companies had to bear the risk of unknown costs and utilization in the start-up years, which turned out to be higher than they expected, insurers had to absorb legislative uncertainty of whether the rules would be rewritten. He s talking about the payments that were supposed to go out for 2014, after Republicans regained control of both houses of Congress. Insurers risk corridor claims were much higher than their contributions. For FY2015, Congress stipulated that risk corridor payments under Obamacare could not exceed the amount that insurers owed to the program. Thus, they only got 12 percent of what they believe they were promised.Or, to put it another way, they were playing by one set of rules, and then Congress abruptly changed those rules.Now, we can argue till we re blue in the face whether insurers, Congress, Obamacare, or all of them, are responsible for that problem. It won t change the cold, hard fact that Republicans have been working hard on creating uncertainty in the market, and their repeal-with-no-replacement plan just makes that uncertainty much worse.It s worth noting that that s a big reason for why premiums are going up this year, too.So, as Silvers says: And now comes the reality of the  repeal and replace  initiatives from the Republicans. If the uncertainty of this market was large before with the ACA, it is almost unknowable under whatever comes next. Thus the initial exit of some latecomers, including United Healthcare, and undercapitalized minor entrants, such as nonprofit co-ops, is almost certain to become a flood of firms leaving the exchanges. They have little choice since the risks are too large and the actuarially appropriate rates are still not obvious given the political turmoil and changing rules If we want them to continue to do the good things required by the ACA, we can t make it so uncertain. What this means is that the mechanisms designed to reduce risk and a stable set of operating arrangements must be reaffirmed as core principles of all reform and replace efforts. This shouldn t be hard for market-oriented Republicans, if they can leave behind their political baggage. Blind talk of repeal with no clear way to build confidence among the private insurers, which will be needed in the replace phase, leads to market failure. In short, their idea of a fool-proof repeal is going to backfire horrifically on them. While that might seem like something we can laugh at, it isn t, because millions of Americans will become collateral damage in this mess.

Clearly, they have something sinister in mind by specifically targeting those federal employees.And under the cover of the uproar over Republican efforts to kill the ethics panel, Republicans passed a rule known as the Holman Rule that gives Republicans the power to target specific individual federal workers and programs.According to the Washington Post,The rule changes the process of passing spending bills by allowing any rank-and-file House member to propose an amendment that would cut a specific federal program or the jobs of specific federal employees, by slashing their salaries or eliminating their positions altogether.Before this rule change, an agency s budget could be cut broadly, but a specific program, employee or groups of employees could not be targeted because of civil service protections.For example, Republicans could use the rule to cut a specific federal worker s pay down to a $1. Yeah, you read that right. One whole dollar.So let s say Republicans find out that a certain federal worker in the Energy Department in studying the effects of climate change. They could persecute that person by cutting their pay to force them to stop doing their job.

H. Morgan Griffith is the Republican who revived the rule and his opinion on the rule is even more frightening because he compared it to using a sniper rifle against the federal government and admitted that Republicans could use the law to send thousands of federal employees to the unemployment line.He favors a strategic application of the law, likening it to a bullet from a sniper rifle rather than a shotgun.

This number would bring Trump down from 306 to 256, making his election victory less-than Constitutionally legal.Republicans are absolute hypocrites   they only whine about election fraud when it looks like things aren t going their way. If things are going their way, then the votes are legit and any effort to prove otherwise is partisan bullshit. It s quite similar to how Trump said he d accept the results of the election prior to Nov. 8   if he was the one who won. Otherwise, look out, is what seemed to be his message.As part of their Electoral Vote Objection Packet, an advocacy group known as Americans Take Action tells Congress in no uncertain terms that at least 50 electoral votes were not  regularly given or not lawfully certified.  That number could actually be over 100. The group is non-partisan   they have Republicans as well as Democrats and Independents working on this.They also have 15 attorneys, legal assistants and law students who prepared the brief pro bono to deliver to Congress in a last-ditch effort to get them to object to certifying the Electoral College s votes. The illegitimate votes, according to the report, include two from Arkansas, one each from Louisiana, Michigan and Oklahoma, three from Texas, and seven from North Carolina.The report also includes electors who were ineligible because they already held public office, such as Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (who s suspect as it is given that she dropped a case against Trump after he donated several thousand dollars to her reelection campaign).Ryan Clayton, of Americans Take Action, an advocacy group that headed up the effort behind both the research and the briefing, said: Trump s ascension to the presidency is completely illegitimate. It s not just Russians hacking our democracy. It s not just voter suppression at unprecedented levels. It is also [that] there are Republicans illegally casting ballots in the Electoral College, and in a sufficient number that the results of the Electoral College proceedings are illegitimate as well.Republicans like to talk all the time about people voting illegally. We have a list of a bunch of Republicans that allegedly voted illegally in the Electoral College. Pam Bondi is the attorney general of the state of Florida and the Florida Constitution says that you cannot hold two offices. And she holds the office of Attorney General and she holds the office of federal elector in the Electoral College. That is a violation of the law. That is a violation of the Constitution. And the vote that she cast in this election is illegal. This is a last-ditch effort and we re sure everyone knows this. However, bringing this to the attention of Congress is the least anyone can do.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Abortion became a legal procedure in 1973. According to the Supreme Court, it s about a woman s right to privacy. More than 40 years later, a Republican judge put a new spin on the abortion debate. He ruled that it s fine for a doctor to discriminate against a woman who s ever had an abortion. They can discriminate against men too, but only if the man was born with female body parts.The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) forbids discrimination on the basis of sex or gender identity. It also forbids discrimination based on whether a woman has had an abortion. In other words, the Federal Government has applied a fairly broad definition to sex discrimination, as they should.U.S. Justice Reed O Connor has a different vision, though. He ruled that sex discrimination has only one meaning   discrimination against a woman for being a woman or a man for being a man. As Slate points out, though, who is to determine who is a man or who is a woman?But O Connor recognizes only one kind of sex discrimination: hostility against a man or woman for being a man or a woman. This belief directly contradicts Supreme Court authority; it also doesn t make much sense, since it only raises the key question of who decides whether an individual is a man or a woman. (Is discrimination against an intersex person not sex discrimination? What about a person with ambiguous genitalia who identifies as male?) Still, O Connor got away with this blinkered understanding of sex in blocking federal guidelines on bathroom access for transgender students. And naturally he pulled the same trick here, holding that the HHS rule does not build upon  sex discrimination  and is therefore unlawful.Clearly, this ruling was based on the ludicrous idea that religious people are being discriminated against when they are being told they can t discriminate, much like the Hobby Lobby ruling, which allowed businesses to discriminate against women by not offering birth control with their company insurance plans. Ironically, they don t have to offer paid maternity leave or help out with any of the consequences from not having access to birth control. Still, O Connor tried to rationalize it, calling insuring transgender people a  burden. That fear is now an undeniable reality. O Connor held that treating transgender patients and even insuring transgender patients substantially burdens  insurance companies and hospitals   exercise of religion.  As a result, under RFRA, the HHS rule must be  the least restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling government interest.  O Connor decided that the rule did not constitute  the least restrictive means  of preventing discrimination. Why not? Because  the government [can] assume the cost  of transgender-related treatment, and  assist transgender individuals in finding  a doctor who will treat them. The judge then goes on to suggest that protecting transgender people from discrimination isn t actually a  compelling government interest  in the first place.As for the abortion part of the ruling, well, doctors are not, and have never been, required to perform abortions. This, though, would allow a doctor to not treat a 55-year-old woman for, let s say cancer, just because she had an abortion at 17.The most bizarre part of the ruling, though, had nothing to do with the law and everything to do with 16th Century thinking. The Christian medical associations who brought the suit argued that treating either transgender patients or women who ve had abortions is tantamount to  material cooperation with evil.  What century are we in again?This ruling, though, would open the doors to other types of discrimination, essentially against anything a religious doctor might find yucky, like treating LGBT people or the children of LGBT people.Many will shrug their shoulders and argue that it s no big deal, that the majority of doctors will still treat all patients. While it s hard to say that s true right now, in some parts of the country, it s not that simple. In many parts of the South, for example, it might be difficult to find a doctor who s willing to treat either a woman who s had an abortion or a transgender person. Funny, though, that doctors are still not allowed to discriminate against people born male or Christians.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Even if Trump deletes them, there are likely always going to be copies that were captured via screenshot.But Bernie Sanders didn t need to worry about that because Trump rarely deletes his past tweets, which made things awkward for Trump and the Senate Republicans as Sanders took to the floor to passionately defend Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, all three of which Republicans want to gut after Trump takes office on January 20th.Throughout the primaries and the presidential campaign, Trump told his supporters that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. Most prominently, he repeated that message on Twitter in May 2015 to claim that Mike Huckabee copied him by saying the same thing. I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid,  Trump wrote.  Huckabee copied me. Well, during his time on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Sanders used that very tweet against Trump, even going so far as to blow it up for all to see, to demonstrate that if Trump signs any legislation Republicans send him to target these sacred programs, he would be breaking a core promise to the people who voted for him.Sanders began by calling out Republicans for cruelly seeking to repeal Obamacare, which would leave millions of Americans without health insurance and increase the deficit by hundreds of millions of dollars.He then slammed Republicans for taking at a Medicare in their budget bill, a move that would eliminate Medicare as it currently exists, a government-run program that actually works to provide senior citizens the healthcare they need at a far lower cost than a private insurance plan would provide.Sanders also repeated a statement Trump made on April 8, 2015. Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security,  Trump said.  They want to do it on Medicare and they want to do it on Medicaid and we can t do it. It s not fair to the people who have been paying in for years. In March, Trump attacked Paul Ryan for planning to gut Medicare, but Trump made it clear that he doesn t support Ryan s plan because it will cost Republicans the election. Millions of people voted for him on the belief that he would keep his word,  Sanders declared.Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump is already backing away from his promises, which means his supporters were duped in the worst way. They were stabbed in the back and now have to face a future where Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and Obamacare do not exist. And they only have themselves to blame for believing Trump in the first place.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Sens. Ben Cardin (MD), Dianne Feinstein (CA), Patrick Leahy (VT), Tom Carper (DE) and Amy Klobuchar (MN) just introduced a resolution to create an independent panel to investigate the allegations, which goes totally against Mitch McConnell s stated desire to simply have committees handle it.This panel would have about 18 months to investigate and then present its findings to Congress. That info would identify the people responsible for the hacks and include a recommendation for how to respond. Sen. Leahy said: We need an accounting   a serious, independent and bipartisan investigation of attempted Russian interference in the American presidential election. This is larger than any one candidate or any one election. Of course, Mitch McConnell thinks the Senate Intelligence Committee should handle such an investigation. He even announced back in December that the Intelligence Committee would be looking into the Russian hacks.However, McConnell also has no problem at all looking into how Obama responded to the Russian hacks. While he hasn t announced an independent panel on that front, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will start looking into Obama s new sanctions against Russia and probably other responses.Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) said that they ll be looking at the broader issue of Russian hacking, but here s a question: Would they look into the presidential response if Trump had announced new sanctions in response to Russia s meddling?Chances are, they wouldn t. Congressional Republicans have already shown how they re working to ingratiate themselves to Trump. While there s always a chance they d defy him on something like that, it seems more likely that they d champion Trump as a true patriot who won t allow foreign powers to dictate what happens here.If we can spend millions on independent panels investigating the giant nothing-burgers of both Benghazi and Hillary s email server, surely we can have an independent panel look into something on which our entire intelligence community agrees happened. Republicans will give Democrats a hard time for this, but at least Democrats are trying to do something real. All the GOP response to the idea of an independent panel shows is that taking Democrats like Hillary down over non-issues is far more important than doing something about Russia meddling in our affairs.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Trump pathetically used this information to defend Russia despite the fact that multiple intelligence reports have pointed right to the Kremlin.In response to this, Rather took to Facebook to rip Trump a new one for his  cavalier dismissal  of Russia s involvement in the U.S. election. Rather didn t mince his words, perfectly stating what many of us are feeling at this point, as our future President sides with our adversaries. Rather wrote: Stunned disbelief. Anxiety. A mounting sense of betrayal. These are the smoke signals rising from those in and around the United States intelligence community over President-elect Donald Trump s dismissal of the evidence of Russian hacking in the presidential election. Rather blasted Trump for trusting Assange over America s own intelligence communities, remarking on Trump s stupidity for trusting someone who clearly doesn t have the United States  best interest in mind: Assange, in an interview with Fox News  Sean Hannity (who at this point must be considered a full-fledged propagandist and abetter) said he didn t get the information from Russia. Well if he says so  Let s just use that same standard for all of our adversaries. Nothing to see here. Why waste all these billions of dollars on intelligence gathering? Rather also raised a question that many of us have been wondering when he asked how the many  people risking their lives  and using their  immense analytical skills   instead of   making millions on Wall Street  feel about  Mr. Trump s cavalier dismissal of their work. Rather perfectly stated that Trump s denial and refusal of the intelligence reports is dangerous and  affects all Americans, and people around the world.  The legendary reporter called on Trump s fellow Republicans and advisers to knock some sense into the President-elect: Hopefully patriots within Mr. Trump s own party and in his inner circle will step up and tell the incoming president how dangerous this rhetoric is. Heaven forbid we suffer another horrible attack. Heaven forbid our intelligence community was hollowed out, wasn t listened to or respected. These are the stakes. No one could have said it better.

But where there s a will there s a way when it comes to the GOP screwing over the American people, so they decided to defund the program through a budget resolution instead, which only needs a majority vote.NPR explains that this  means they can essentially gut the law, removing all the subsidies that help low- and middle-income people buy health insurance and getting rid of the smorgasbord of taxes   on medical devices, insurance companies and wealthy individuals   that pay for those subsidies. Repealing Obamacare will be a complete and total disaster, but that hasn t stopped Republicans from fighting against the healthcare program tooth and nail since the day it passed seven years ago.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) is Trump s pick for attorney general. The U.S. attorney general is generally someone who not only knows what s legal and illegal but also knows what s right and what s wrong. Sessions doesn t know right from wrong, at least insofar as civil rights goes. He s desperate to change his image as a racist prick, but real civil rights lawyers aren t having any of it.He s even cited civil rights cases that he supposedly worked on, but it turns out, all of that is a bald-faced lie. Several attorneys who have fought long and hard for true civil rights penned an op-ed, which appeared in the Washington Post, denouncing Sessions for pretending to be a civil rights champion.Actually, they didn t just denounce him, they annihilated him for it. Right off the bat, they said: Attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions is trying to mislead his Senate colleagues, and the country, into believing he is a champion for civil rights. We are former Justice Department civil rights lawyers who worked on the civil rights cases that Sessions cites as evidence for this claim, so we know: The record isn t Sessions  to burnish. We won t let the nominee misstate his civil rights history to get the job of the nation s chief law enforcement officer. Sessions had to fill out a questionnaire and file it with the Senate Judiciary Committee. In that questionnaire, he listed four cases that he claims he personally litigated as Alabama s attorney general in the 1980s. After receiving backlash for that lie, he then tried to claim he provided  assistance and guidance on these cases. One of the examples these lawyers give to show Sessions is trying exaggerating his record on civil rights: Sessions supported reauthorizing the Voting Rights act ten years ago, and he s promoting that as solid evidence that he s a civil rights champ.The truth there is that the reauthorization passed the Senate by a vote of 98-0. As such, there was no feat of courage involved in supporting that reauthorization. It would mean a lot more if he d supported it with significant opposition from his own party. Then he celebrated the Supreme Court s decision to gut the Voting Rights Act, which led to Southern states working their tails off to keep minorities from voting.Sessions also once lost out on a judgeship because of his racism. In 1986, the state of Alabama turned him down for a position as a judge after he called a black lawyer  boy.  He supposedly also told another attorney to  be careful what you say to white folks.  He also denigrated both the ACLU and the NAACP as  un-American  organizations that were inspired by Communists.Because equality is totally a communist trait.The NAACP has actually been protesting his nomination as Attorney General, and several got arrested for doing so. For as  not-racist  as Sessions supposedly is, one would think he d yell at anyone who arrested peaceful protesters who were just speaking out about racial inequality.Instead, these protesters face charges of criminal trespass.The civil rights attorneys that actually know what they re talking about say that Sessions   involvement  in the cases they themselves litigated is limited to his signing a complaint and maybe a few briefs. He didn t personally litigate anything, and if he had, he probably would have done so with an eye towards,  Black people bring this on themselves because they re black. In fact, they end their op-ed with: Sessions has not worked to protect civil rights. He worked against civil rights at every turn. Sessions knows that his real record on race and civil rights is harmful to his chances for confirmation. So he has made up a fake one. But many of us who were there   in Alabama in the 1980s, 1990s and beyond   are still around. We lived that story, too. And we are here to testify that Sessions has done many things throughout his 40-year career. Protecting civil rights has not been one of them. Both Sessions and Trump probably think that Congress will buy their revisionist history. To them, equality doesn t matter   in their view, white people rule and everyone else drools. There s a reason white supremacists are thrilled with Trump s election win, and this is it. Jeff Sessions doesn t give a flying fuck about civil rights. He doesn t know a thing about litigating civil rights cases. He ll make a shitty attorney general, and will only help Trump further his agenda of setting this country back 75 years.Featured image via Kevin Hagen/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

On Saturday, Trump said that he knows  things that other people don t know  about the hacks and that we can t be sure who actually did it (you know, unless we listen to the CIA and the FBI).Now, Trump knows a lot about postponing things   like his press conference concerning his numerous conflicts of interest he doesn t want to address.

While swearing in the new Senate, Biden was caught talking about  The Biden Trust  where he said: It s not so much about raising money or philanthropy, though there will be some of that, but it s more about keeping these guys cooperating and changing the culture. He then answered a question saying: I m going to be based out of Penn for foreign policy deliberately not associating with any one medical center.

And because he s gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. A mission Biden is taking very seriously now and plans to continue after he is no longer vice president.Biden had said previously when he announced he wasn t going to run for president in 2016, that he s  going to spend the next 15 months in this office pushing as hard as I can to accomplish this.

He was on board a Brooklyn subway train, listening to his headphones like many teens do, when he looked up and saw a man deck a woman who s an Orthodox Jew.

Khalifa says he could almost feel it: It was a very hard slap, I almost could feel the slap. He was 6-foot-6, and a very big, big guy. He could have decided not to get involved. After all, he s Muslim and she s Jewish, and we all know Muslims are evil jihadists who especially hate Jewish people. He s a teenaged boy and the woman s attacker was huge. He could have stuck his head back in his headphones and minded his own business except he decided that catching the guy was his business. So, as Rayvon Jones ran, Khalifa held the train s doors open and yelled to the conductor to stay at the station and call for help.And then he took off after Jones, while also calling the cops. Khalifa later said, on camera: I felt bad for her because she was innocent, like innocent, she did nothing wrong. He did lose Jones briefly, but another Orthodox Jew asked him what happened, and then offered to help Khalifa find Jones. When they found Jones at a bus stop, they called what s known as the Shomrim, or the Jewish safety patrol. Jones climbed on a bus and pulled his hoodie over his head, prompting Khalifa to shout: Get out you coward! Why are you trying to hide! When the police got there and pulled Jones off the bus, he got aggressive and kept screaming he was going to kill everyone. He was taken into custody and charged with assault, and one of the Shomrim drivers took Khalifa home. The woman was taken to the hospital in stable condition.Khalifa sees everyone as people. People asked him why he would help a Jewish woman when he s Muslim, and it s his nature to treat everyone the same way. Obviously, when someone needs help, he helps, regardless of who it is.  Us vs. them  doesn t seem to have touched him the way it s touched so many others.

But his nomination was rejected by the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee because of racially charged comments and actions. At that time, he was one of two judicial nominees whose selections were halted by the panel in nearly 50 years.In testimony before the committee, former colleagues said that Mr. Sessions had referred to the N.A.A.C.P., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other civil rights groups as  un-American  and  Communist-inspired.

Republicans gave themselves the ability to kill investigations and even barred the panel from reporting crimes to law enforcement.The move has generate national outrage, including from Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar, who ripped Republicans a new one on Tuesday.Pointing out that House Republicans are apparently insisting that they can police themselves, Goldberg remarked that Trump s promise to  drain the swamp  is now  stuck. Joy Behar then chimed in with a salvo of her own. First of all, Congressional ethics is an oxymoron,  Behar began.  Particularly in this Congress. But it s sort of like on the slippery slope towards a dictatorship, you know.  First, we re going to be very secretive about what we do. We re going to police ourselves. You re not going to know what bad things we re doing. We re going to keep it very quiet.  It s very scary. Sunny Hostin read Donald Trump s pathetic response to the news, in which he only had a problem with Republicans making it their first priority.Behar noted that  it s just about priorities, it s not that he cares about ethics of it. And Hostin piled on by explaining what it means to allow Republicans to police themselves. [T]his Office of Congressional Ethics was created after all these things happened. You had a string of really serious ethical issues and now the Republicans are saying,  We re going to get rid of that. We re just going to use the House Ethics Committee and we re just going to police ourselves. Which means we re going to get an A every time.  It s like, if you made me grade myself, I get an A every time. Jedediah Bila chimed in by pointing out the hypocrisy of Republicans because they initiated countless investigations against Hillary Clinton but don t want to be investigated themselves for their own wrongdoings, to which Behar replied,  You know, Jedediah, when you re shameless there s nothing you can do about it. They are shameless. And when Bila slammed Republicans for not standing up against this move, Behar had the perfect response. It s very hard to stand up when you re spending time on your knees,  she said.Here s the video via VidMe.Clearly, the only reason Republicans wanted to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics is because they intend on pulling some incredibly unethical shit in Congress, which could very well include bribes from lobbyists considering the GOP intends to consider infrastructure spending, tax cuts for the wealthy, and massive defense spending. And the fact that they can t be reported to law enforcement for committing crimes is a complete travesty.Gutting the ethics panel should really be seen as treason because Republicans just gave themselves permission to steal from and cheat the American people with impunity.And after much outrage, Republicans backed away from their unethical agenda. However, they just want to wait until the story dies down so they can try again. That s why we need to remain vigilant.Featured image screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

NBC has been crystal clear that they can not and will not match that money. Sources declined to tell the New York Times what, exactly, Kelly s annual salary will be, but she is almost assuredly taking a pay cut based on past remarks.While it is entertaining to see Kelly  stick it to  Fox News, we have no choice but to wonder why NBC would hire someone who thinks that Santa and Jesus are both real (and white dudes), who blamed Sandra Bland for her own death, who thinks that pepper spray is a  food product, essentially,  and who has done and said so many horrific things over the years that a truly functional society would treat her as a pariah   though, of course, she was one of the few right-wing voices who actually stood up to Donald Trump to some degree.Naturally, Trump fans are celebrating the news:Megyn Kelly is moving to NBC!

Under Speaker Nancy Pelosi s leadership, the panel was created as a non-partisan entity and has done a good job.But Republicans are gutting it because the panel has done its job too well so they passed an amendment which basically gives them direct oversight of the panel and the power to kill investigations they don t like. So if the panel is investigating a Republicans, they can kill it and then turn around and allow an investigation against a Democrat.According to CNN,The proposal would bar the panel from reviewing any violation of criminal law by members of Congress, requiring that it turn over any complaint to the House Ethics Committee or refer the matter to an appropriate federal law enforcement agency. The House Ethics Committee would also have the power to stop an investigation at any point and bars the ethics office from making any public statements about any matters or hiring any communications staff.And the ethics office would no longer be able to accept or investigate any anonymous reports of alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress.Republicans claim that the ethics panel abused its power and that it  falsely accused  members of Congress of committing ethics violations. These members allegedly had to  spend a fortune  to defend themselves. Frankly, it sounds like Republicans are just mad because they got caught putting their hand in the cookie jar and they are attacking the panel to make sure they can t be caught again.By gutting the independent panel and placing it under their supervision, Republicans just paved the way for their members to commit crimes at will. They could a take a bribe from a lobbyist and then vote to kill any investigation that arises. It will create a free-for-all for lobbyists at a time when Republicans intend to consider infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and massive defense spending.This especially concerns Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics attorneys under President Obama and President Bush, because the 115th Congress  is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated. So not only will the White House be corrupt under Donald Trump, Republicans just guaranteed that the House of Representatives is going to be corrupt as well, proving once again that Republicans only care about using government to enrich themselves instead of helping the American people.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Everyone that voted against Trump   which was the majority of Americans   likely felt combinations of disbelief, depression, disgust, fear, and anger that such an unqualified, undeserving human being could somehow come out on top despite losing the popular vote.Recently on the WTF podcast, singer Bruce Springsteen summed up how many of us feel about Trump s upcoming presidency perfectly. When host Marc Maron asked him if he was scared of what the new Commander in Chief might mean for the future of our country, Springsteen said, Yeah. Of course. How could you not be? Then Sprucesteen elaborated, dropping the devastating truthbomb that all of us feel. He continued: I ve felt disgust before, but never the kind of fear that you feel now. It s as simple as the fear of, is someone simply competent enough to do this particular job? Do they simply have the pure competence to be put in the position of such responsibility? Remarking on the fear mongering tactics that Trump used to appeal to his gullible supporters, Springsteen said he understood why Trump was able to attract support from his voters, but made sure to acknowledge the fact that they d all been played for fools. He said: I think if you were effected deeply by the industrialization, globalization, and the technological advances, and you have been left behind; and somebody comes along and tells you  I m gonna bring all the jobs back. Don t worry about it. They re all coming back.  You re concerned about America changing, the browning of America  I m gonna build a wall.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal s editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, announced that his paper would no longer call out Trump on his lies. Sure, they ll still report what he says, but apparently, Baker thinks that it should be up to the readers to decide whether Trump is lying or telling the truth. In other words, Baker is tossing out journalistic responsibility, probably to avoid becoming a casualty of Trump s crusade against the  dishonest media. Dan Rather, former CBS Evening News anchor and veteran journalist, has a different take on this. In explaining his perspective, he took the Wall Street Journal through a paper shredder for Baker s new stance, blasting Baker s decision right out of the gate: A lie, is a lie, is a lie. Journalism, as I was taught it, is a process of getting as close to some valid version of the truth as is humanly possible. And one of my definitions of news is information that the powerful don t want you to know. Basically, if you can concretely back up your assertions that someone is being less-than-honest, then, as a journalist, it is your responsibility to say so. Baker tried to differentiate between lies and misstatements by saying the word  lie  indicates an intent to deceive in yesterday s interview, but Rather sees right through that (as do the rest of us): It is not the proper role of journalists to meet lies especially from someone of Mr. Trump s stature and power by hiding behind semantics and euphemisms. Our role is to call it as we see it, based on solid reporting. When something is, in fact, a demonstrable lie, it is our responsibility to say so. Little Green Footballs  Charles Johnson also sees a massive problem with Baker s decision, and posted this series of tweets about it:WSJ editor Gerard Baker said they won t call Trump s lies  lies.  But check out how many articles they printed saying Hillary Clinton lies.  Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) January 2, 2017@Green_Footballs Something like this?https://t.co/tM4OTNflJDApparently they had no problem using that word for her.  Orange Cosby (@Unabogie) January 2, 2017Couldn t find a single WSJ article, news or opinion, referring to Trump lying. But I found MANY articles calling Hillary Clinton a liar.  Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) January 2, 2017I don t have time to count how many Clinton  liar  articles they published. Looks like hundreds at least.  Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) January 2, 2017What absolute, hypocritical horseshit coming from the Wall Street Journal, then. It really does look like Baker s trying to cover his ass to avoid ending up in Trump s anti-media crosshairs.There are things Trump says that are demonstrably lies, even under Baker s definition. For instance, he claimed he never told people to check out Alicia Machado s alleged  sex tape,  when he literally tweeted,  Check out sex tape.  He ran an ad that supposedly showed Mexicans streaming across our border, which was actually a recording from Morocco (his campaign later tried to backpedal on that, to no avail).He claimed to have seen a top-secret tape of a U.S. plane unloading cash and giving it to Iranian officials in Iran (he and his campaign tried to backpedal on that, too). He also claimed he sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama s birth certificate, and then said they couldn t believe what they were finding. That never happened.And that was all before he was even elected. It s really hard to wonder whether he had an intent to deceive with these, given how they played into his larger goals.As the Washington Post s Greg Sargent points out, he doesn t throw falsehoods around casually. His claim that he saw thousands of Muslims cheering the Twin Towers as they fell from the streets of New Jersey was part of a larger effort to demonize Muslims and boost his own appeal to the xenophobic right.After explaining how Trump s birtherism was part of a larger effort to gain political clout and legitimacy, Sargent goes on to say: In these cases, was Trump lying? The standard that Baker adopts   that there must be a provable intent to mislead   seems woefully inadequate to informing readers about what Trump is really up to here. Sure, it s possible that Trump continued to believe these things after they were debunked. We cannot prove otherwise. But so what? If we accept that it s possible to prove something to be false   which Baker does, judging by his own comments   then we presumably also accept that this can be adequately proved to Trump. And so, Trump is telling a falsehood even though it has been demonstrated to him to be a falsehood. And that s what Dan Rather is getting at in his Facebook post: We are being confronted by versions of what are claimed to be  the truth  that resemble something spewed out by a fertilizer-spreader in a wind tunnel. And there is every indication that this will only continue in the Tweets and statements of the man who will now hold forth from behind the Great Seal of the President of the United States.

At least seven in 10 Americans were confident in Barack Obama, George W.

And that includes President George W. Bush.The deficits in Trump s ratings relative to his predecessors  are largely because of the low scores he gets from supporters of the opposing party. On average, 21% of Democrats have confidence in Trump across the five presidential duties for which Americans also rated Bush and Obama (all except handling the economy and defending U.S. interests abroad). By contrast, for the same five areas, an average of 60% of Republicans were confident in Obama and an average of 57% of Democrats were confident in Bush. These data underscore the much more polarized partisan environment in which Trump will be taking office.Donald trump may believe that everyone likes him but the results clearly show, like the popular vote, that Americans really despise him.Also, as Trump enters the White House with an approval rating below 50 percent, President Obama is exiting the office with an approval rating of 55 percent, one of the highest on record for a president leaving office and higher than the historical average.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

A democracy depends on the freedom to oppose those in power, without fear of reprisal, without being denigrated or labeled an enemy.Reich then wished Trump a Happy New Year and asked him to learn how to act as president before January 20th.Happy New Year, Mr. Trump. You have 20 days in which to learn how to act as a president. All of us   even those who oppose your policies and worry about your character   sincerely hope you do.Let s hope Trump gets this message and it sinks in. A good first step would be for him to stop using social media.Featured image via Comunicas""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But members of the Congressional Black Caucus intend to fight him tooth and nail to protect people of color. As such, they have formulated a battle plan to resist policies that may be harmful to these communities The stakes are incredibly high and our community is counting on us as the last line of defense between Donald Trump and the worst of what America could offer,  Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said.Throughout his campaign, Trump proposed policies targeting specific minority groups, such as banning all Muslims from entering the U.S. and building a wall to keep out all the rapey Mexicans. He was also the champion of the  birther  movement, which was nothing more than a racially motivated attack on the country s first African-American president. The campaign that we saw over the last 12 months is very frightening. And there s been no effort on his part to even temper his comments since being elected,  said outgoing CBC Chairman G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.).  It s going to be very contentious, I suspect, if Mr. Trump even follows through on half of his promises during the campaign. Incoming CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond (D-La.) plans to lay out the CBC s plan in more detail when he officially takes office on Tuesday. But he says that the people Trump has appointed to his cabinet are highly concerning. We speak for vulnerable people, we speak for the disenfranchised   and we take that seriously,  Richmond said.  And those appointments seem to be tone-deaf to sensitivity and to, I think, just common sense. At the top of the worrisome list of cabinet appointments are Alabama senator and open racist Jeff Sessions, who is Trump s attorney general pick, and alt-right hero and former Breitbart bigwig, Steve Bannon, Trump s senior adviser. The appointments should concern not just minorities but all Americans,  said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.).  When you look at Sessions, I mean he doesn t have the most stellar reputation for civil rights and voting rights. It s rough. Members of the CBC note that this is a first. Having a battle plan to resist the racist policies of an incoming president is hardly business as usual. This is not the normal incoming president,  added Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.).  We had no plan for George Bush. I think Charlie Rangel and John Conyers would tell you they didn t even have a plan for Richard Nixon. But this is not the norm.

Nixon was very shrewd and tactical, sedulous, careful  he wouldn t have been tweeting  he would have been saying,  Let s take away the Washington Post s broadcast licenses that they rely on for their revenue,  which, you know, Trump may be doing soon when he is granted the power of the executive office,  Perlstein warned.Indeed, Trump is poised to change the relationship between the White House and the press from one of cordiality and mutual benefit to one of antagonism and open hostility.Trump s refusal to accept facts makes him even more of a threat because he will now have the power to punish news outlets who write the truth about him.Host Christ Hayes pointed out that unlike Trump, Nixon had some self-control. Nixon would not have taken to the podium and said,  I don t like this person, this person and Dan Rather;  he was self-controlled enough to channel that! This is different insofar as this is all out there in public. Perlstein then explained how Trump may attack people who criticize him once he takes control of the full power of the government, including the NSA, which he could use as his personal  spying apparatus. Basically once Trump can find out anything enemies are up to and find out where their vulnerabilities are, maybe find embarrassing things about them  leak them to Breitbart and soon it s, you know, on CNN, God forbid MSNBC, then we re talking about a different ballgame. Hayes noted that such behavior by a president is ultimately what led to Nixon losing the trust of the American people and being forced to resign or face impeachment.Perlstein then warned that Trump could use the IRS to attack people and businesses who have slighted him and seek lists of names in departments so he can  cut them off at the knees,  which is something his transition team is already doing.Here s the video via YouTube.But even if Trump commits these impeachable offenses, Republicans in Congress don t care about the Constitution enough to actually do something about it.

In a typical interview with Trump s team, news anchors have to constantly fact check and repeatedly bring Trump s minions back to the original questions and topics as they deflect blame and avoid answering every question.On Monday s  New Day,  CNN host Alisyn Camerota had to interview Trump spokesman Sean Spicer, and it was basically an interview from hell as Spicer wouldn t give her any responses to the most pressing questions. Camerota had tried to ask Spicer just what special information Trump claimed he knows about Russia s involvement in the US election. Spicer s response couldn t have been more insane as he said Trump gets a lot of  classified information, intelligence reports  on a daily basis (despite the fact that Trump s team once said the president-elect only gets briefings once per week). Spicer then went off topic and said Trump will wait to make conclusions about the hacking, ignoring the fact that Trump has defended Russia extensively from all blame.Camerota was unwilling to let Spicer avoid the question, and she said: I want to get back to my question. Is Mr. Trump, who said he s going to reveal something, he says he knows things. Spicer again refused to give a response, stating that Trump would talk about it himself right before blaming Obama for not talking about China s 2015 hacking. Camerota responded by fact-checking Spicer right then and there. She said: Sean, just to correct you, you say not a single statement was ever issued or made after the Chinese hacking. I have the statement right here in my hands. Spicer s response was pathetic, as he admitted to being wrong but still continued to blame Obama, accusing Obama of responding too late. Camerota tirelessly tried to bring Spicer back to her question: Sean, I m more interested in what Mr. Trump is going to do. We re not electing President Obama again. You are representing Mr. Trump. Camerota asked about Trump s plans, and Spicer couldn t provide her with anything. All he did was confess that Trump didn t have a final report. Spicer then stunned Camerota by admitting that he had lied earlier when he said Trump had been briefed: The report is not final. He s not been briefed by the heads of the intelligence community. A stunned Camerota said in disbelief,  He has not been briefed about the heads of the intelligence community about whether or not they believe Russia is behind the hacking? Spicer began to fall apart when Camerota told him to  hold on  after he accused anyone who believed  non-final  reports of being irresponsible. Spicer shouted, No! Not, hold on! The idea we re asking people and making assumptions on a report that s not final is unbelievable. The rest of the interview, Camerota was forced to constantly counter Spicer s moronic remarks. Spicer practically ended the interview by completely disrespecting Camerota for expecting that Trump and his team might at least be exploring the possibility that reports about the Russian hacking are correct. Spicer said condescendingly: I know it s frustrating for you that we re doing it in a logical way. No, we re going to get all the information, get briefed properly and make a decision. We re not going to put the cart before the horse. Camerota couldn t believe her ears.

The book also carries its own description on the back: Drawing upon exclusive interviews and exhaustive research, political analyst David King has compiled a complete and brilliantly accurate account of Donald Trump s virtues and qualities. This is a refreshingly different biographical masterpiece. If you didn t already know what this was, you might want to burn this book in protest. However, it s worth at least one look, given that King and his blank pages freely admit that Trump has absolutely no redeeming qualities worthy of our respect, admiration and trust.Does Trump actually deserve our respect? Our admiration? There s a difference between the Office of the President and the person who s occupying said office. Trump has done nothing to earn either. He claims credit for things he hasn t done, like consumer spending during the Christmas season. He s come under fire for sexually assaulting women. He s blatantly racist.And so on, and so forth. There s not a reason in the world that anyone with two brain cells rubbing together should respect and admire Trump.As for trust, all we could ask when we first saw the title was,  Really?

Trump made the money on New Years  Eve night through a party at his Florida estate/hotel, the very gaudily designed Mar-a-Lago.Unlike pretty much every other elected official, Trump s property charged admission to their event, and the incoming president was dangled like a shiny object in front of the patrons who pulled out their checkbooks to attend this event.According to Politico, Donald Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida charged a reported minimum of $525 per person for a New Year s Eve celebration that Trump and his family were set to attend. On Friday, Trump s incoming White House press secretary told reporters that the party was  sold out,  with over 800 guests expected at the event. That s more than $420,000 made off of dinner, dancing, and access to the incoming President of the United States.Incoming White House Director of Strategic Communications Hope Hicks attempted to dismiss concern that the Mar-a-Lago s pricy New Year s Eve Party comprised yet another conflict of interest issue for Trump.  The transition is not concerned about the appearance of a conflict,  she told Politico.  This is an annual celebratory event at the private club, like others that have continued to occur since the election. Additionally, the president cannot and does not have a conflict. So far, the mainstream media has simply allowed Trump and his team the leeway to say  there is no conflict of interest,  in a manner that has more in common with Obi-wan Kenobi s Jedi mind trick from Star Wars than a truly responsive political team. But very few people outside of die-hard Trump supporters and his tight inner circle actually believe that this is a credible response to a serious inquiry.Trump and his squad will have to come up with more credible excuses   or, heaven forbid, stop being so crass and unethical   for inquiries to come from Democrats (most of them at least) and the media (maybe). It s  probably a safe bet, though, to assume that his fellow Republicans are perfectly fine with rubber-stamping his behavior as long as he has an (R) behind his name.Trump s behavior on this topic also calls into question his repeated assertion that he is a billionaire ten times over. He infamously refused to reveal his tax returns, and now he says and does anything to scrounge up a few hundred or thousand dollars seemingly everywhere he can. That isn t the behavior of a man with billions at his disposal at the drop of a hat. Is his quest for cash simply another area of vulnerability that will be exploited by either his own party, or by a foreign entity?

Baker noted that the WSJ investigated his claim and found it baseless. I think it s then up to the reader to make up their own mind to say,  This is what Donald Trump says.

We have just elected a man who started a hot war with a female anchor instead of attending a debate she moderated. We are in a new place. And I don t think it s good. And I don t think it has any parallels to the past. Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for Bush, also stated that the hard feelings are on both sides, and called the tension between Trump and the media a  double-barreled hostility.  Fleischer said: He can use it to his advantage, because as the Gallup poll recently indicated, confidence in the press to report the news accurately and fairly has never been lower. And so the press has made itself vulnerable, because it lost the trust of their readers and their viewers   and Trump has widely taken advantage of it. Trump s relations with the press are unprecedented, and Trump has worked hard throughout his presidential campaign to create distrust for the press because it enables him to continue telling lies and makes it harder for him to be held accountable. Trump knows exactly what he s doing, and his presidency is going to be extremely damaging when it comes to how Americans are kept informed.Featured image via Zach Gibson via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

At first, it seemed that China would let Trump s blunder go and chalk it up to his political inexperience. However, when Trump doubled down on his antics, China decided to fly a bomber into the South China Sea in a show of force against Trump, in order to let him know that the United States had better keep the  One China  policy   or else.After this snafu, Ned Price, speaking for the Obama White House s National Security Council, said: There is no change to our longstanding policy on cross-Strait issues. Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross-Strait relations. Well, now, it seems that Trump is going in that direction again, and is even entertaining the idea of taking a meeting with the Taiwanese president. When reporters asked him about his plans for diplomatic relations in that direction and whether he d meet the President of Taiwan, Trump said,  we ll see. He insists, however, that the United States will not have a rocky relationship with China under a Trump administration: Hopefully we re going to have great relationships with many countries   and that includes China. Well, I got news for you, Donald Trump. If you keep flirting with recognizing Taiwan, things with China are gonna go south really, really fast. Diplomacy is important, as you will soon learn. Some of these international relationships are tenuous at best, and one wrong move could cause the whole thing to come crashing down like a house of cards built on the softest bed of sand imaginable. Now that you are the president-elect, your words have consequences. Don t go bandying about nuclear weapons and undoing years upon years of diplomatic norms.

Lisa Blunt Rochester won t let them do so without a fight.During an appearance on CNN with Jake Tapper, Rochester took on two Republicans over their pathetic ideas to replace the Affordable Care Act and she made it clear that she definitely belongs in the House of Representatives.Darrell Issa and Marsha Blackburn spewed quite a bit of nonsense during the panel discussion, with Blackburn insisting that repealing Obamacare would make health care cheaper and that nobody would fall through the cracks. The goal is to make certain that everyone has access to affordable heath care,  Blackburn said.  And then as you phase out, let s say the insurance components, Title I of the Obamacare bill. And you set that up to phase out, so you get rid of the mandate, you get rid of the excise tax, you allow portability and you pass legislation of across-state-line health insurance and open up the insurance marketplace. So Blackburn s solution is to strip Americans of the insurance over time and then replace the law with new laws that don t have anything to do with the current protections Obamacare provides.She also doesn t appear to understand that Obamacare already makes health insurance more affordable and accessible and that without the mandate many young Americans will simply opt out of buying insurance, which will weaken the pool and make insurance more expensive.Rochester responded by informing Blackburn that Obamacare not only makes health insurance affordable and accessible, it provides many protections that would be lost by repealing the law. That was a landmark I will always remember,  the Delaware Democrat said.  That was sort of like seeing an FDR thing in my own lifetime. I talked to a lot of people in my state. And everybody agreed that no law is perfect. But to the extent that we ve touched every single American, everything from dealing with pre-existing conditions to discriminating against women for your coverage to your children who are 26 years or under being able to covered, there are so many good things. And what I would hope is that we would come together and say,  Okay, what are things that we can agree on?  There are parts to this that you can t just pull apart. It s not that simple. Issa, meanwhile, added his idea to replace Obamacare that has nothing to do with making healthcare accessible and affordable. He not only wants to eliminate federal subsidies that would prevent low-income individuals and families from affording health insurance, he wants to strip patients of their right to pursue legal action if their doctor or hospital screws up their care, like removing the wrong leg during an operation.Rochester had a response to that as well. I hope that we will come up with the solutions before we try to get rid of something that will impact all Americans,  she said.  I think it would be malpractice, pun intended. Here s the video via YouTube.Repealing Obamacare is going to be more difficult than Republicans realize. Not only would they enrage millions of Americans, they d be pissing off their own constituents since many conservatives in red states also rely on Obamacare.But these Republican ideas are not a real plan. They fail to address most of the aspects of Obamacare that people like, which Rochester listed such as requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions and treating women equally.Taking health care away from Americans while stripping them of their rights as patients does nothing but hurt people and it would cause the uninsured rate to skyrocket and return America back to the not so distant days when a major health crisis could cause a family to go bankrupt and lose their home. It s time for Republicans to accept that Obamacare should remain intact and move on to dealing with real problems that need solutions.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Kansas  economy is imploding, but rather than fix it by repealing his disastrous tax cuts, Governor Sam Brownback wants to raid the state investment fund instead.When Brownback gave a massive tax giveaway to big business and wealthy residents, he destroyed the state government s ability to generate revenues to pay for things like education, which has suffered greatly ever since.The budget shortfall is projected to stand at $930 million by 2018 and it just keeps getting bigger.Brownback and his Republican allies in the state legislature have been desperately trying to fill the massive gap by any means, including auctioning off sex toys and making deep education cuts.In other words, Kansas Republicans refuse to admit they made a mistake by slashing taxes the way they did and basically will do anything to fill the budget hole except reversing the tax cuts.A new idea Republicans have is to raid the state investment fund, which currently stands at over $300 million from money the state put aside to grow with investments in the stock market. This money is supposed to go toward paying for needs the state may have in the future.According to the Wichita Eagle,One source of money that the governor is eyeing is a long-term investment fund, according to Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning, R-Overland Park.Denning said the governor plans on using the roughly $360 million fund  to get out of the crisis  for the next six months  without having to do deep, deep cuts to K-12. The governor s on board and all the budget folks are on board,  Denning continued.  And all the legislators that have read about it   that I ve talked to   they re on board because they know that if we don t do this one-time money with such a short time frame left in fiscal year  17 that we d have to take almost that entire cut to K-12. There s no other place to go. You ve got to take your hat off that they ve looked under another sofa cushion and found another one-time solution. But this one, I think, is important, and I think all the legislators will support it. But that s not true. GOP state Senator Carolyn McGinn, who is the new chair of the Budget Committee, said the idea sounds like a shady pay-day loan. It looks to me like we re taking a payday loan,  she said.  We re borrowing against ourselves again internally, and I think it s just going to put us further away from where we need to get to. Indeed, Brownback and his GOP allies apparently think the only answer to fix their mess is to steal government money from other programs, including money from a tobacco settlement that funds children s programs. They re even considering doubling taxes on people who make under $30,000 a year which would squeeze low income families even more in a state that is waging war on food stamps.The state investment fund would only be a temporary fix for the current fiscal year because while it would close the current $350 million gap, an even bigger gap of $580 million would need to be plugged after July, when the next fiscal year begins. Plus, they would have to pay back the fund if they choose to pay it back at all, which would mean the people of Kansas lose that long-term investment into their state s future.In short, Republicans need to admit they screwed up and reverse Brownback s disastrous tax cuts for the wealthy and big business so they can get their fiscal house in order again without resorting to stealing money from children and the poor.Kansas Republicans should be embarrassed about the budget crisis they caused and they should rectify it by admitting that trickle-down economics do NOT work and reinstate the taxes that should never have been cut in the first place. It s time for big business and the wealthy to start paying their fair share again to save Kansas from utter financial ruin.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I just want them to be sure because it s a pretty serious charge,  Trump said before invoking the lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  If you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong. So I want them to be sure. I think it s unfair if they don t know. But that s not exactly true. Former CIA official Tyler Drumheller said in 2006 that the Bush Administration ignored intelligence concluding that Iraq did NOT have weapons of mass destruction. When presented with the assessment, Bush and his team refused to believe it and went to war in Iraq anyway.So when Trump blames the intelligence community for getting WMDs in Iraq wrong, it s inaccurate. They actually got it right. Bush was the one who was wrong by ignoring them.Trump didn t stop there, however. Just like when he claimed to know more about ISIS than our generals, Trump claimed to know more about hacking than the experts at our intelligence agencies. And I know a lot about hacking,  Trup continued.  And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.

And while he clearly knows how to use social media, Trump definitely does not know how to hack a computer. HOur intelligence agencies know how to trace hacks because hacking leaves traces and signatures that can be used to determine where the hack originated.That s how we know Russia hacked us. It s incredibly dangerous for Trump to claim that he knows all this stuff and that he knows more than the experts. Because then he can undermine the experts all the time and his gullible supporters will believe him instead of the facts, which is what Trump has been doing for over a year and a half now.

Here s the video via YouTube.It s not enough to call out lies. It s time to punish pundits who blatantly lie on the air like Ferguson did.

If it weren t for the Inaugural College, we would likely never have had a President George W. Bush and all the disasters that followed. No wonder Republicans love the Electoral College. They haven t won the popular vote for the presidency since 1988. It s also no wonder they want to abolish the popular vote.In an OpEd in the conservative blog, the Reason, writer Eric Boehm argued that ONLY the electors should vote and no one else.It s difficult not to agree with some of the argument. Boehm suggests that the Founding Fathers didn t trust Americans to think for themselves, and there is some truth to that and they were right, to an extent. In their days, literacy was not for the common man and today, well, we fall for fake news.Yes, get rid of the popular vote. For all the money, time, and attention paid to the presidential race, the actual votes cast on Election Day are basically meaningless. In non-swing states, votes are literally meaningless. Even in states where a small number of votes could change the outcome of the election, your vote and mine are still so insignificant as to be practically worthless, as Reason editor in chief Katherine Mangu-Ward explained in detail in 2012.The only reason to hold popular votes for president, as the system functions now, is to select the  electors  from each state who will participate in the Electoral College.Here s a better way. Hold a national lottery to determine the 538 electors (drawing an appropriate number from the voter rolls of each state) and then let those people choose the president.Source: ReasonAccording to Boehm, this would ensure that people who actually care about the election would be the ones voting. It would also free the rest of us up to do whatever we want to be doing, or whatever we need to do to keeps our lives on track.While it might be appealing to take the masses out of the equation, Boehm s solution does absolutely nothing to solve the problems created by the Electoral College. A vote in Wyoming, for example, is worth four times what a vote in California is worth. In other words, the Electoral College isn t even representative, let alone democratic.The other huge problem with the Electoral College is that it s designed to keep white people and people in power in power. It s also designed to suppress the vote and it leaves women and minorities without a voice at all.Obviously, I can t know what Boehm s motives are, but it s clear that the motives of the Republican party are to keep minorities from voting, wherever they can. The demographics in this country are changing quickly. If it weren t for the Electoral College, it s doubtful we d ever have another Republican president, at least unless they dramatically change their platform. As for the lottery he proposes, well, who s to guarantee the lottery would choose engaged voters? We d still have uninformed voters, just a lot fewer of them.Featured image via Sarah Rice/Getty Images.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""As President Obama is threatening and acting out on retaliation for Russia s hack of the United States election, it s becoming evident that the hack was even bigger. According to a report in the Washington Post, the Vermont electric utility was also hacked.While the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a security matter, the discovery underlines the vulnerabilities of the nation s electrical grid. Officials in government and the utility industry regularly monitor the grid because it is highly computerized and any disruptions can have disastrous implications for the country s medical and emergency services.No one is sure at this point why the Russians hacked the small utility, but it s possible that they did it just to show us they can. It could also have been a test, similar to the way credit card thieves start with small charges to test the card.This is also far from out of character for Russia. Earlier in 2016, Russia allegedly hacked the power grid in the Ukraine.The hackers who struck the power centers in Ukraine the first confirmed hack to take down a power grid weren t opportunists who just happened upon the networks and launched an attack to test their abilities; according to new details from an extensive investigation into the hack, they were skilled and stealthy strategists who carefully planned their assault over many months, first doing reconnaissance to study the networks and siphon operator credentials, then launching a synchronized assault in a well-choreographed dance. It was brilliant,  says Robert M. Lee, who assisted in the investigation. Lee is a former cyber warfare operations officer for the US Air Force and is co-founder of Dragos Security, a critical infrastructure security company.  In terms of sophistication, most people always [focus on the] malware [that s used in an attack],  he says.  To me what makes sophistication is logistics and planning and operations and   what s going on during the length of it. And this was highly sophisticated. Source: WiredWhile Lee couldn t say for sure it was Russia, the Ukraine is convinced it was. Nonetheless, Lee said, it was a very well-funded operation and it could have been from a nation-state.As Wired notes, the electrical infrastructure in the Ukraine is more secure than it is overall in the United States. Beyond that, many of our electrical grids don t have backup, which means that it could be hours, days, or even longer before we get power back.Even more frightening, the entire nation could be without power indefinitely if just nine of its 55,000 substations were hit by terrorists or by hackers.A coordinated attack on just nine of the United States  55,000 electric-transmission substations on the right day could cause a blackout from Los Angeles to New York City, according to the study conducted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The study s results have been known for months to select people in federal agencies, Congress and the White House, but were reported publicly for the first time Wednesday. The WSJ did not publish a list of the 30 most critical substations identified by the FERC study.One particularly troubling memo reviewed by the Journal described a scenario in which a highly-coordinated but relatively small scale attack could send the country into a long-term literal dark age.  Destroy nine interconnection substations and a transformer manufacturer and the entire United States grid would be down for at least 18 months, probably longer,  the memo said.Source: TimeOne of Donald Trump s campaign promises has been to improve the infrastructure. Obama has been trying to do that for most of his time in office, but Congress has blocked that. Still, even if Trump does get an infrastructure bill signed, his relationship with Russia is troubling. Will his loyalty be with the United States or is he indebted enough to Russia that he will leave the doors open for them to attack us where we are the most vulnerable? It s a disconcerting question, to say the least, and it s why the hacking of the election, along with Trump s praise of Putin, is a big f*cking deal.UPDATE: The Washington Post has issued a correction. The utility was hacked, but that Vermont utility is not corrected to the grid. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid. Authorities say there is no indication of that so far. The computer at Burlington Electric that was hacked was not attached to the grid,  an editor s note attached to the original article said.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Putin, who personally directed an effort to hack Donald Trump s opposition in what the CIA has confirmed was a far-reaching effort to install Donald Trump as President, has been earning nothing but praise from The Donald, who says with a wink-and-a-nod that he totally knew nothing about anything that was happening and denies that Russia is responsible for the hacks.Putin says that instead, he will wait for Donald Trump to become President before he decides how to move forward   a fairly concrete sign that the two are working in collusion.

Mark Meadows even wrote a list of 300 rules he wants Donald Trump to repeal in his first 100 days in office, including rules that are designed to push back against rape culture on college campuses.According to USA TODAY,One new entry is an April 2011 guidance document from the Department of Education s Office of Civil Rights setting out standards for how universities should handle sexual harassment and sexual violence complaints.Meadows  updated report says the guidance  has pressured colleges to spend hundreds of millions of dollars and to create vast campus bureaucracies  to investigate sexual assault and date rape    the incidence of which may be overstated.  The guidance  virtually dictates one-size-fits-all procedures which provide less protection to the accused,  the report claims, and denies the rights of  the often-innocent accused. This proves without a shadow of a doubt that Republicans hate women and want to see rape culture flourish on college campuses.Meadows is literally using his time and position to defend rapists instead of the victims these rules are designed to protect. There is a huge amount of evidence that campus sexual assault is a problem,  End Rape on Campus director of education Sofie Karasek said in response to Meadows  claims, pointing out that  the number of false rape accusations is between 2% and 8%   on par with the rate of false accusations for other crimes. Young women across the country now have to be more concerned about a Trump presidency more than ever before because it is clear that Republicans intend to do more to benefit rapists over the next four years while trying to repeal every protection and right women have gained over the last few decades, including the right to choose. Let s not forget that Republicans want to force rape victims to have their rapist s baby.Let s also not forget that Republicans have made many offensive statements about rape over the years, with the consensus being that women should just lay back and enjoy being raped.Meadows is certainly making advocates for legal rape happy. They want Trump to make rape legal across the country, and rolling back these rules would be a step toward that evil goal.One would hope that Ivanka Trump would step up and tell her dad that he should not support such an agenda, but right now, Republicans think they have a puppet in the White House who will do whatever they want him to do, and that makes Trump and the GOP incredibly frightening.Featured Image: Woman s Survival""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I think many of us have called for America to really step up and consider what it is that we are funding and supporting via the U.N., and how it works so hard really against U.S. interests, and just saying   look what the U.K. just did,  Palin told Breitbart.  This is such an encouraging time, where it s not just us, but those across the pond, too, are understanding that their nation s sovereignty and security are on the line here, with the ties that bind us to interests that really don t further our agendas. Yes, God forbid that other nations have opinions, too. When the U.K. made its move, it was just another reason to call yet again for the U.S. to get the heck out of the U.N. and get the U.N. out of the U.S.,  Palin continued.  Let s get going on putting America first so that we can sweep our own porch before telling other nations how to sweep theirs. But the United Nations does not tell America what to do. U.N. resolutions must be approved by the Senate to apply to the United States and we have the power to veto resolutions.Palin then pleaded with Trump to pull America out of the United Nations. I called for our next president, Donald Trump, to call for the unshackling of the political bands tying us to the U.N.. By exiting the U.N., where injustice is actually rewarded, we then will be able to uphold America s reputation as the leader, and as the kind and compassionate and generous nation that we are   as the nation sharing values that, when emulated by any other nation, can bring justice and equal rights to any other nation. She then claimed that a revolution put Trump in office and that the same revolution will end the peacekeeping organization that has been around since after World War II. It s our money funding the lion s share of the globalist circus. It s we the people needing to rise up and make this a part of the revolution that we have just so benefited from.

So far, they have a former America s Got Talent contestant to sing the national anthem and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.Of course, Mormons voted for Trump despite claiming that they opposed him throughout the campaign. Even Bill Maher applauded the Mormon Church as the only religious organization that seemed to not want to vote for someone hypocritical to their faith. But they did anyway as Utah went for Trump on Election Day.The Rockettes are being forced to dance at the inauguration as well, which set off a firestorm among the members because Trump is a creepy pervert and sexual predator.And for one member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, looking at herself in the mirror every morning was getting more and more difficult, so after much thought and prayer, she announced that she is resigning rather than sing for a tyrant.In a Facebook post, Jan Chamberlin courageously explained why she had to quit the choir she loves after five years.Since  the announcement , I have spent several sleepless nights and days in turmoil and agony. I have reflected carefully on both sides of the issue, prayed a lot, talked with family and friends, and searched my soul. I ve tried to tell myself that by not going to the inauguration, that I would be able to stay in Choir for all the other good reasons. I have highly valued the mission of the Choir to be good- will ambassadors for Christ, to share beautiful music and to give hope, inspiration, and comfort to others. I ve tried to tell myself that it will be alright and that I can continue in good conscience before God and man. But it s no use. I simply cannot continue with the recent turn of events. I could never look myself in the mirror again with self respect. I also know, looking from the outside in, it will appear that Choir is endorsing tyranny and fascism by singing for this man,  she continued.And Choir s wonderful image and networking will be severely damaged and that many good people throughout this land and throughout the world already do and will continue to feel betrayed. I believe hereafter our message will not be believed by many that have loved us and adored what we have stood for. I know that I too feel betrayed. Tyranny is now on our doorstep; it has been sneaking its way into our lives through stealth. Now it will burst into our homes through storm. I hope that we and many others will work together with greater dilligence and awareness to calmly and bravely work together to defend our freedoms and our rights for our families, our friends, and our fellow citizens.Chamberlin went on to note that her father was  distraught  over the Holocaust and that her parents despised tyranny. She sees history repeating itself and warned that we need to educate ourselves and fight back before it s too late.I only know I could never  throw roses to Hitler.  And I certainly could never sing for him. Much love to you all. I wish you all blessings and happiness. My heart is shattered and broken . but my conscience is clear. And THAT, really is all that matters.Predictably, Trump supporters lashed out at Chamberlin.I bet all of these bullies hated President Obama for the last eight years and cheered on the Republican obstructionism and utter disrespect they showed him. Yet, they have the gall to accuse Chamberlin of not being a true Christian.

And that s a good thing.When Ayesha passed away in 1993, she left the famous restaurant to her nephew, who is citing budgetary reasons for declining to add Trump to the mural. Our official position is that it is not in the budget,  Abu-El-Hawa stated.In other words, Trump can go f*ck himself.Donald Trump does not deserve to be recognized in a mural that celebrates diversity.

I am an 86-year-old Hungarian Jew who became a US citizen after the end of World War II,  Soros wrote in an op-ed on Wednesday.  I learned at an early age how important it is what kind of political regime prevails. The formative experience of my life was the occupation of Hungary by Hitler s Germany in 1944. I probably would have perished had my father not understood the gravity of the situation. He arranged false identities for his family and for many other Jews; with his help, most survived. Soros  story is especially important now as countries across Europe move to the extreme right-wing as white nationalists once again aim to grab absolute power. They ve even managed to grab power in the United States through Donald Trump. And Soros warns that democracy is in danger.I find the current moment in history very painful. Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of closed societies   from fascist dictatorships to mafia states   are on the rise Democracy is now in crisis. Even the US, the world s leading democracy, elected a con artist and would-be dictator as its president. Although Trump has toned down his rhetoric since he was elected, he has changed neither his behavior nor his advisers. His cabinet comprises incompetent extremists and retired generals.He then predicted what the United States faces under Trump s regime.[T]he US will be preoccupied with internal struggles in the near future, and targeted minorities will suffer. The US will be unable to protect and promote democracy in the rest of the world. On the contrary, Trump will have greater affinity with dictators. That will allow some of them to reach an accommodation with the US, and others to carry on without interference. Trump will prefer making deals to defending principles. Unfortunately, that will be popular with his core constituency.In short, dictators around the world, especially Vladimir Putin, will have more freedom to pursue their evil agendas without being challenged by America. Our leadership on the world stage will be greatly diminished as nations like Russia and China take advantage of Trump s ineptness.America faces a four-year long disaster that could become permanent if Republicans have their way.Of course, conservatives are lashing out at Soros in response because his name is a trigger for them.@georgesoros Jan 20th comes around the search warrant is going to be issued & enjoy Russia & Putin dick in your mouth @realDonaldTrump  Jimmy Taouil (@JimmyTaouil) December 28, 2016@georgesoros @OpenSociety happy to see your petulant rant!

The White House has announced that 35 intelligence operatives are being ejected from the country. In addition, sanctions will be placed on Russia s two leading intelligence services, including four top officers of the military intelligence unit.On Thursday, Obama signed an executive order which grants the president the authority to impose travel bans and asset freezes on those who  tamper with, alter, or cause a misappropriation of information, with a purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions. The New York Times reports:Mr. Obama used that order to immediately impose sanctions on four Russian intelligence officials: Igor Valentinovich Korobov, the current chief of a military intelligence agency, the G.R.U., and three deputies: Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov, the deputy chief of the G.R.U.; Igor Olegovich Kostyukov, a first deputy chief, and Vladimir Stepanovich Alekseyev, also a first deputy chief of the G.R.U The administration also put sanctions on three companies and organizations that it said supported the hacking operations: the Special Technologies Center, a signals intelligence operation in St. Petersburg; a firm called Zor Security that is also known as Esage Lab; and the Autonomous Non-commercial Organization Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems, whose lengthy name, American officials said, was cover for a group that provided special training for the hacking.It is unclear at the moment how much of an impact these measures will actually have. The move may end up being largely symbolic, but as the Times points out,  the actions would amount to the strongest American response ever taken to a state-sponsored cyberattack aimed at the United States. U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security, all agree that Russia was behind the DNC hacks and the subsequent slow release of damaging information obtained in those hacks during the presidential campaign. They have also concluded that Russia interfered with the election for one reason: to help Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton.Trump has blown off the findings of the U.S. intelligence community as  ridiculous.  Because the punishments Obama imposed today are an executive order, Trump will have the option of nixing the sanctions when he takes office next month. If he chooses to do so, it is likely that members of Congress, including Republicans, will be furious as they have been calling for an official investigation into the matter.The White House is also planning to release a joint analytic report  from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security which will give more insight into the information that has been gathered by the National Security Agency.

A two-state solution would not change that, nor does the United Nation resolution condemning the continued construction of settlements. Nobody is arguing that Israel doesn t have the right to exist, but what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people is inexcusable and is only inflaming the Middle East. The United States cannot afford to sacrifice more blood and treasure fighting the entire Muslim world but that s what Israel is pushing for by continuing to build settlements that make peace impossible.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But because he will be inaugurated as the next Republican president in January, these same mega-celebrities, who would normally drool over an invitation to sing for the president, want no part of it.Trump s inauguration team sought out some of the world s greatest musicians, but nearly all of them have refused for fear of backlash or to stand against him politically.Isn t it amazing how  not cool  it is to be conservative in the public eye?

The problem is that these top entertainers have fan bases so large that they can easily say  good riddance  to conservative fans and not see much change in their star power and revenue stream.Speaking of revenue streams, clicking through the rest of Bristol s rant means you will be bombarded with pleas to buy her books and her mommy s books.

Bush.Trump, or more likely, someone working for Trump, knows that he needs to offer at least some diversity, especially with the enemies he s made in the Latino community with his  wall  rhetoric in the campaign. The problem is, though, he can t find any in a country with about 57 million Latinos and Hispanics. I can tell you now I have spoken to numerous folks on the transition, and they say that he s absolutely looking for qualified Latinos for a Cabinet post,  said Mario Rodriguez, head of the Latino PAC Hispanic 100. Rodriguez, who sits on Trump s Hispanic advisory committee, said transition officials have asked him for recommendations and they gave him positive feedback about Trump s prior meetings with Hispanic candidates. I think some appointments are going to be pretty quick. President-elect Trump was very impressed by the candidates. He wants to put a Latino in the Cabinet, he s not doing it just for show. Source: PoliticoTrump is trying to fill the position of Agriculture Secretary with a Latino and he s receiving a lot of backlash from his farmer supporters. According to Politico, the farmers don t want it to be a political pick. Of course, they are Trump supporters, so there s a better than even chance they don t like the idea of someone with brown skin determining farm policy, especially after Trump said he wants to deport Latinos.Part of the problem is that Trump is looking for a qualified Latino to take the position. There s no doubt there are plenty, but few who likely share his political beliefs. Still, it s weird that he should look for qualified now. His current picks are some of the least qualified to ever serve office (remember, Rick Perry, who has just a Bachelor s Degree and nearly flunked a class called  meats,  is slated to be Energy Secretary and Ben Carson, who is a doctor, a medical doctor, will serve as Director of Housing and Urban Development) just as he is among the least qualified who will ever serve in the Office of the Presidency.Even if Trump is able to hire a Latino   even a qualified one, it might not matter.Many Hispanic leaders say they are less concerned about having a Cabinet pick than what Trump s policies could mean, particularly with deportation and a wall along the Mexican border. These people say picking a Hispanic Cabinet member for agriculture could be seen as a token with little real value and liken Trump naming his only black Cabinet member to lead Housing and Urban Development.In other words, Trump could have the most diverse cabinet ever and still be the worst president for diversity in history.

It gives them a chance to grab something to eat and recharge their batteries so they can go back to work with a fresher mind and body. Workers perform their jobs better with breaks and are less likely to make mistakes.That s why workers get a mandatory break thanks to labor unions and the federal government.But fast-food CEO Andrew Puzder wants to force workers to work straight through the day without a break.In a 2009 interview dug up by OC Weekly, Puzder expressed his disdain for the state of California where the Carl s Jr. restaurant originated and openly whined about overtime laws and other worker protections, including laws allowing workers to take a much needed break during their shift.Trump s labor man also had choice words for Carl s Jr. s home state.  I think the big change in California, it s really become a kind of socialist state,  Puzder opined.  You can t be a capitalist in this state, and Carl was at heart a capitalist who created a company that to this day bears his initials.  The would-be Labor Secretary complained about regulations and overtime laws, claiming workers are overprotected. Have you ever been to a fast food restaurant and the employees are sitting and you re wondering,  Why are they sitting?'  Puzder asked.  They are on what is called a mandatory break [emphasis his].  He shared a laugh with the interviewer, saying the so-called nanny state is why Carl s Jr. doesn t open up any new restaurants in California anymore.In short, all those Trump supporters who think Trump is going to make their lives easier will not only lose Social Security and their healthcare, they are going to lose break time at work as well as their overtime pay, minimum wage, and other protections that keep them safe and unexploited while on the job.The choice of Puzder as Labor Secretary is the ultimate  f*ck you  to the working class. Trump literally picked a guy who opposes worker s rights and the right to get paid fair wages.Any blue collar worker who voted for Trump because they believed he was on their side have just been betrayed and while they are denying it now, they won t be able to deny it once they are worked to the bone and get little pay, no healthcare, and no Social Security to save them from poverty once they retire, assuming they are able to retire at all.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The story goes that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta secretly run a child prostitution ring out of the basement of a Washington D.C. pizza shop that doesn t even have a basement.While most would roll their eyes at such a ridiculous tale, one crazed Trump fan barged into the Comet Ping Pong earlier this month   guns blazing   and feverishly searched for the nonexistent basement or the secret tunnels in which Hillary Clinton was keeping children captive to sell to anyone who wanted to make sexy time with them. The shooter, who fortunately did not kill anyone, admits he got his news from the same place Trump does   far-Right conspiracy theorist and professional liar Alex Jones of Infowars.

On Monday, a Philadelphia man barged into a Catholic church to accuse not only Hillary Clinton   but Barack Obama   of selling children for sex. Howard Caplan   a man who became internet-famous by walking around with a ridiculous  Hillary 4 Prison  sign during the election season and who goes by  Deplorable4L  n Twitter posted a video of him interrupting the service to scream incoherently about pizza and pedophilia. Pizzagate is real! Pizzagate is real!  Caplan yelled at shocked onlookers who were simply trying to enjoy church.  The Catholic Church has been sexually abusing children thousands of them for decades. Pizzagate is real! While he is correct that there is an epidemic of child molestation in the Catholic church, Caplan somehow fails to see that even in the most deranged versions of the  Pizzagate  story, the Church is uninvolved.In November, Caplan and an army of other stupid people traveled to Washington D.C. to protest Comet Ping Pong. In an interview with the Philly Voice, he explained that the conspiracy goes above even Clinton, whom many believe to be the ringmaster of this fictitious child sex ring.Caplan explained that the  emails are not the story.  According to him, the real story is  a child pedophilia ring that goes all the way up to Obama. Caplan claims to be a lifelong Democrat who converted to the Dark Side because he believes insane right-wing propaganda that only the dumbest people alive would believe. Now, he says he hopes Trump will take care of Hillary once and for all: I m hoping Trump s just saying in his mind,  That s fine, we won t get you on the emails but we ll hopefully get you on this.  This is way bigger than the emails anyway. If he s really saying that he s not going to prosecute her to let her ride off into the sunset, people aren t going to go for that. He will lose a lot of credibility. Sadly, this is not an isolated thing where one lunatic caused a scene. This conspiracy theory has gone mainstream among the Stupid Part of America.

That means that all personal liberties could fly right out the window, except for one: the liberty to discriminate based on who people love. Trump and the new Congress haven t even taken office yet and the legislative hatred has already begun.Ted Cruz, who s never met a gay person or a woman who didn t make him feel self-righteous, is expected to reintroduce the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA), which, despite its completely inoffensive name, is all about allowing bigots to freely discriminate. Trump is expected to sign it.In the text, the bill says that businesses can refuse service based on one of two beliefs, and both are ridiculous: that marriage  is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman  or  sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage. As for the second one, well, unless a couple is entering an establishment demanding space to specifically have sex, it doesn t seem there s ever a reason to declare that one. As for the first, marriage is what the law says it is, and the law says that marriage is between two consenting adults who get married. Okay, that s not the legal definition, but the Supreme Court, when Antonin Scalia was still alive, said that defining marriage is unconstitutional.The CEO of Equality Texas agrees that the proposed law shouldn t be a law at all. The legislation that Senator Cruz is proposing specifically elevates two narrow interpretations above any other religious practice,  Chuck Smith, CEO of Equality Texas said.  The bill is titled the First Amendment Defense Act, but in reality it is an unconstitutional attempt to totally redefine what the first amendment protects. Source: KXANIt would also put the Federal Government in the weird position of suing itself. The FADA would allow businesses to sue if the government wouldn t let them discriminate. The U.S. Attorney General would be required to defend the businesses against the government.Trump will likely sign the bill, at least according to his campaign s website: If I am elected president and Congress passes the First Amendment Defense Act, I will sign it to protect the deeply held religious beliefs of Catholics and the beliefs of Americans of all faiths.

Yesterday, Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin   the candidate that many conservatives hoped would have beaten Donald Trump   sent out a series of tweets blatantly exposing the racism that exists within the Republican Party.In his revealing tweetstorm, McMullin condemned conservatives like Carl Paladino, who had recently made these offensive comments about First Lady Michelle Obama: I d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortable in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla,  Paladino said.Twitter McMullin also stated that many Republicans were aware that there is a racism issue in the GOP, but they are up against a majority of conservatives who are too invested in their white privilege to explore a better way forward.TwitterTwitter McMullin also made sure to throw Trump under the bus for his racist, divisive rhetoric   as he has had a major role in how racism played out in our country over the last year.Twitter McMullin s tweets were surely going to infuriate most Republicans who insist that America is post-racial instead of addressing their ignorance, but he also made someone else angry. Former KKK leader and avid Trump supporter David Duke was among the first to respond to McMullin and bash him for being so transparent:Twitter And of course, McMullin s response couldn t have been more perfect: Racism within the Republican Party has been a massive issue, and some GOPers have made lesser attempts to point this out. Years ago, South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham said,  We re not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.  And yet, the GOP has still ignored the fact that racism exists and continues to promote platforms that exclude minority voters. Hopefully, McMullin s brutal honesty will encourage the Republican Party to take a good hard look at itself.Featured image via George Frey/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

People would cheer.And it could happen if New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has enough evidence to charge Trump with crimes related to his fraudulent  charity. The Trump Foundation is currently under investigation for self-dealing, which means the foundation paid out donations to its own officers, which is illegal and totally unethical and immoral.Money that should have been used to help cure cancer has instead benefited Trump personally as he has used foundation money to buy stuff for himself, pay legal fees and settlements, and pay executives involved in running the scam.Trump, of course, whined on Twitter about the investigation, claiming that 100 percent of funds go to charities.I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won t report!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016But Trump is lying because even the Trump Foundation admitted to self-dealing in their 2015 tax returns to the IRS.Trump even thought he could escape the legal system by simply shuttering the foundation, but Schneiderman s office informed him that he can t  legally dissolve until that investigation is complete. And if that investigation finds that Trump broke the law, he would be subject to charges and arrest. And as military veteran and blogger David Axe points out, there is precedent for an NYPD officer to arrest Trump and haul his ass to jail. President-elect Donald Trump could be in big legal trouble over his allegedly self-dealing charity,  Axe began.  It s entirely possible that he could eventually face arrest. And it wouldn t be unprecedented if, say, a New York cop actually slapped cuffs on Trump and read him his rights. After all, a ballsy policeman arrested Pres. Ulysses Grant way back in 1866   albeit for a comparatively minor crime. It s not unprecedented for a small-time cop to arrest America s commander-in-chief. In 1866, Pres. Ulysses Grant got busted for riding his horse at an unsafe speed at 13th and M Streets in Washington, D.C. The arresting officer, William West, had previously issued Grant a warning for the same offense. Do you think, officer, that I was violating the speed laws?  Grant reportedly asked West. I certainly do, Mr. President,  West replied.  I am very sorry, Mr. President, to have to do it, for you are the nation s chief executive, but my duty is plain, sir. I shall have to place you under arrest! Do your duty, my good man,  Grant said. West escorted the president to the police station for booking. Grant paid a fine and walked free. Officer and president reportedly became friends after the incident.Yes, this really happened. And stealing money from charities is a hell of a lot worse of a crime than speeding while riding a horse.In fact, the precedent of arresting sitting presidents for breaking the law goes back even further. Franklin Pierce was arrested in 1853 for running a lady over with his horse. The case was dropped due to lack of evidence.But the points stands. Police officers can arrest the president for violating the law and it sure looks like Trump violated it repeatedly.As Axe points out, however, Trump probably won t go quietly. If a New York cop arrests Trump, it seems unlikely that the notoriously temperamental Trump   and his equally angry private security detail   will react as gentlemanly as Grant did to his own arrest,  he concluded.Frankly, Trump should be thrown in a prison cell next to Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff. Because while Madoff only scammed rich people, Trump stole money from kids with cancer to pay his employees and his legal bills.

He speaks before he thinks and often lashes out over the smallest slights or any other thing Fox News bitches about in the morning.Americans are sick and tired of Trump s reliance on Twitter.

Fifty percent of Democrats named Obama as most admired, compared with 34% of Republicans choosing Trump.So Trump is not even admired by a majority of his own party. SAD!And while Gallup did mention that it s possible that Trump could continue the trend of incumbent presidents winning the title in 2017, it will be harder to do so if his approval ratings continue to be in the toilet.But there s more. Hillary Clinton captured 12 percent of the vote to win the title of most admired woman for the 15th consecutive year. But Melania Trump, nor Ivanka Trump, made the list. First Lady Michelle Obama, however, came in second.Clearly, the American people think much higher of President Obama and Hillary Clinton than they do of Donald Trump. After all, Clinton did win the popular vote in an election which Russia intervened on Trump s behalf.Had President Obama been on the ballot, he more than likely would have won a third term.

The suit alleges that the intelligence agencies failed to comply with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by refusing to turn over requested documents.According to The Hill:On Dec. 14, Leopold and Shapiro asked the intelligence agencies for copies of communications to or from the Electoral College and any records that mention or refer to a requests Electoral College members made for information and briefings on the investigations into ties between Trump, his campaign or his associates. The request included mentions of Russian government interference in the election.Earlier this month, the CIA revealed that their assessment of Russia s election meddling had found that not only had they interfered with the U.S. presidential election, but they had done so with the express purpose of helping Donald Trump win. The FBI later announced that they agreed with the CIA s findings.In the suit, Leopold and Shapiro are asking the court to compel the intelligence agencies to turn over the pertinent records as mandated by the FOIA. This is not Leopold s first rodeo when it comes to these kinds of cases. Most notably, he was part of the lawsuit that got the State Department to release Hillary Clinton s emails.Trump has dismissed the idea that Russia meddled with the election as  ridiculous  and has claimed that Democrats are just making it up as an excuse for his  massive  win. (Quick reminder, he lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes and even his electoral college win isn t all that freaking massive in reality.)Numerous lawmakers, from both the left and right, are calling for an official investigation into Russia s unprecedented interference in our election.Featured image via David Burnett/Newsmakers/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Unfortunately, residents of Elkhart seem not to know it, and neither do most Trump voters. Despite the fact that the U.S. economy has been on a constant trajectory of growth, almost since the day President Barack Obama took office, the vast majority of Republicans thought the economy has been horrible under Obama. Who can blame them? That s all Donald Trump and Fox News have been saying. The funny thing is, though, that immediately after the election, nearly half of Republicans thought the economy was getting better.In Elkhart, even the people who would acknowledge that things are getting better for them refuse to give Obama credit for it. They do seem willing to give Trump credit, though, despite the fact that he s done nothing yet. These two paragraphs from the article are going viral and they offer a big glimpse into the minds of Trump supporters:Andi Ermes, 39, offered a number of reasons for disliking Obama. She said Obama didn t attend the Army-Navy football game, even though other presidents had. Obama has actually attended more Army-Navy games than George H.W. Bush. She said that he had taken too many vacations. He has taken fewer vacation days that George W. Bush. She also said that he refused to wear a flag pin on his lapel. While it is true that Obama did not wear a flag on his lapel at points during the 2007 campaign, it was back on his suit by 2008. Ermes told me the news sources she consumes most are Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and a local conservative radio show hosted by Casey Hendrickson.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ermes sees the biggest signs for hope in the economy in Carrier deal struck by Donald Trump, which will keep 1,000 jobs in the U.S.  He s not even president yet and already he s helping the economy,  she said.Of course, the Carrier deal was just another Trump lie. Far fewer than the originally touted 1,000 jobs were saved in the Carrier deal, which was just a tax break. President Obama, on the other hand, saved 1.2 million jobs with very little fanfare.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Taylor worked at the Clay County Development Corporation, a non-profit taxpayer funded organization that works with the state and local government, including Mayor Beverly Whaling, who replied to Taylor post by telling her it  made my day. Comparing black people to apes, monkeys, or gorillas has been considered a racial slur for decades.Whaling remained silent in the wake of being caught supporting Taylor s racism. Taylor, on the other hand, claimed that criticizing her for being a racist is a  hate crime,  which did not improve her situation in the slightest.In fact, she was suspended from her job and Whaling resigned in disgrace.And then she was reinstated to the disbelief of many who thought that Taylor would rightfully be terminated since it s clear she can t do her job fairly because of her hatred of black people.But justice soon prevailed as Governor Earl Ray Tomblin s office released a statement announcing that Taylor  was removed after the state reached an agreement with the nonprofit s board of directors.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""If this becomes a Republican strategy across the country, the American people will suffer greatly.Maine voters approved state minimum wage increase to $9 an hour earlier this year by a 10 point margin. That s means the state government must honor the will of the people and punish any employer that doesn t comply with the law.But Governor Paul LePage is opening the door for employers to openly ignore and defy the law, which sets a dangerous precedent that Republicans will likely employ around the nation in order to get around the minimum wage laws they hate.The strategy is simple, just don t enforce the law and let employers treat employees like slaves.And that s what LePage is toying with as he tests his strategy out for the next month.According to an announcement by the Tea Party governor,From Jan. 7, 2017, when the new minimum wage law is scheduled to go into effect, and until Jan. 31, 2017, the department will not bring enforcement actions against any employer who fails to comply with the change in the tip credit or the minimum salary requirement for overtime-exempt workers. Employers are expected to follow the law and pay the minimum hourly wage of $9.In short, when the law takes effect on January 7th, employers can ignore it at least until January 31st. That is, unless LePage decides to extend the length of the time-period, which he could do since he s an asshole.And this could end up becoming a strategy used by other Republicans in other states and even at the federal level since Donald Trump and the GOP control the government, including the Justice Department and the Labor Department.Mainers for Fair Wages campaign manager Amy Halsted blasted LePage for defying the voters and every hardworking person who desperately needs the wage increase. Governor LePage has now gone beyond ignoring the will of Maine voters and is flat-out encouraging employers to commit wage theft,  she said.  Refusing to enforce the minimum wage law, and especially the increase in the base wage for tipped workers from $3.75 to $5 an hour, is a slap in the face to tens of thousands of Mainers who are working hard and too often struggling to afford heat, food and medicine. But LePage doesn t care. In fact, he accused supporters of the minimum wage increase of  attempted murder  and said they should be put in prison. To me, when you go out and kill somebody, you go to jail,  he said.  Well, this is attempted murder in my mind because it is pushing people to the brink of survival. You know what really pushes people to the brink of survival? Not paying them enough to provide themselves with basic human needs like food, clothes, healthcare, and shelter. If anyone should be behind bars it s politicians like LePage and the greedy rich people who oppose raising the minimum wage.At some point, you can only trod over the masses for so long before they snap. Anger and desperation will boil over and the bottom line is that the working poor outnumber the wealthy few so they would be wise to take care of the people who work long hours for far less pay to help make them rich.Featured Image: Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I got up anyway and said to her that she didn t have to sit next to me,  said Jarrett, who had just gotten done working his shift as a hair stylist.  I took a seat across from her and just forgot all about it.  When Pazmino got up to leave the train, a simple insult became much, much worse when she began punching Jarrett. It was not until later when another man rushed to his aid that he realized that Pazmino had slashed his face and stabbed him in the arm with a 2-inch knife. She stabbed me right under my left eye, on the back of my hand and on my left arm. She was screaming and hollering the whole time,  he recalled. I ran to the ticket booth to ask the attendant to call the police, she stated that she did and that I should sit down. And I passed out after that,  Jarrett said.

Pazmino was arrested and charged with a hate crime.Jarrett says he doesn t know if he was targeted because he is transgender, as well, though the racial component is bad enough.

In a video message, Chomsky said: President Obama, to his credit, has issued personal pardons in deserving cases, but he should go far beyond. Chomsky was referring to Obama s actions on December 19th, when he pardoned 78 people and gave 153 prisoners shorter sentences   all of which were non-violent, low-level drug offenders. During his presidency, Obama has pardoned a staggering 1,000 individuals   but Chomsky urged the Commander in Chief to go further due to the looming threat of Trump. Chomsky said: He should proceed to what is, in fact, an urgent necessity, to grant a general pardon to 11 million people who are living and working [in America], productive citizens  threatened with deportation by the incoming administration. If Obama pardoned all those people, Trump s promise to deport 2-3 million undocumented immigrants would go out the window. And despite Trump s flip-flopping on his immigration policies, Chomsky isn t banking on the President-elect being sympathetic or understanding in the long run. Bashing Trump s mass deportation scheme, Chomsky continued: This would be a horrible humanitarian tragedy. And moral outrage can be averted by a general pardon for immigration infractions which the President could issue. Peter L. Markowitz, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, has confirmed that this is actually possible. A few months ago, Markowitz stated: President Obama can still act to bring humanity and justice to an immigration system notoriously lacking in both. He can do so by using the power the Constitution grants him   and only him   to pardon individuals for  offenses against the United States.' It s a common assumption that pardons can be used only for criminal offenses, and it s true that they have not been used before for civil immigration violations. However, the Constitution extends the power to all  offenses against the United States,  which can be interpreted more broadly than just criminal offenses. Chomsky said he hoped that Obama would listen to his plea and protect those who were vulnerable and in danger of Trump s divisive rhetoric, and urged his viewers to join him. Chomsky begged: We should join to urge [President Obama] to carry out this necessary step without delay. You can listen to Chomsky make his plea on behalf of undocumented immigrants below:If Obama does this Trump can kiss all of his anti-immigration promises goodbye and will have to suffer the wrath of his racist supporters.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Now that we re facing a Trump administration, there have been many emerging theories as Americans reflect upon why Trump was able to win the vote over a much more qualified candidate, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.A popular suggestion for why Clinton failed to win the presidency is the idea that she didn t appeal to white working class the way that Trump did. While Trump connected to this demographic with fear mongering tactics and false promises, many feel that Clinton completely abandoned the middle class. However, President Barack Obama disagrees and weighed in on what he really things cost the Democrats the election in a revealing interview with former advisor David Axelrod.During this interview, Obama not only accurately stated that he could have easily beaten Trump if he d been able to run for a third term, but he shattered the notion that the Democrats have abandoned the working class. Obama couldn t have been more spot on when he said,  the Democratic agenda is better for all working people.  He continued: I think the issue was less that Democrats have somehow abandoned the white working class. I think that s nonsense. What Obama believed was the real issue during this election was that the Democrats weren t on the ground in rural communities. He also revealed that Clinton had faced a  double standard  that none of the other candidates were faced with.You can listen to Obama weigh in on the election below, via CNN:Obama: Democrats need to show Americans they care and are  bleeding for these communities  https://t.co/6bH8yY0qIo https://t.co/cmeuzDx0iv  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) December 26, 2016Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

As horrifying as that is, Joy Reid explained during Meet The Press on Sunday that terrorists can now provoke Trump and challenge the United States by attacking buildings with his name on them. You start to have anything with a Trump name on it around the world becoming an instant terrorist target,  Reid said. How do we react to a world in which the name of the president of the United States is plastered all over hotels and hot spots? Indeed, this is yet another reason why Donald Trump should sell his company. Continuing to own it places thousands of people around the world at serious risk. Hotels have been a prime target of terrorists for years, and Trump becoming president gives terrorists a new target. If President Bush or President Obama had had hotels with their names on them in other nations you can bet terrorists would have targeted them as well. But they didn t. Trump, however, does. And Trump s thin-skin makes him an even better target because these terrorists want the United States to go bankrupt with never-ending wars. And if anyone will be quick to take America to war anywhere on Earth, it s Donald Trump.Trump s foreign entanglements also make him and our country vulnerable.Reid explained that Trump s foreign business ties could threaten our foreign policy because other nations could seek to re-write our policy by threatening Trump s businesses or calling in a debt. We cannot discount how his personal conflicts of interest wind up influencing his foreign policy,  Reid said.  We don t know to what international banks he is in debt. We don t know the extent to which his own pecuniary interests might influence his foreign policy, if his children are still running his company and there s a hotel to be built in Dubai, does that influence his reaction if the government of Dubai acts in a way we don t want, in Turkey or other countries. Here s the video via VidMe.It is absolutely critical that Trump put an end to his conflicts of interest. And the best way he can do that is to sell his company. Because any building with his name on it will become a target of terrorism over the next four years and there is not enough security to protect every building he owns. He owns hotels in Las Vegas, Chicago, and New York City just to name a few in the United States and he owns properties in Turkey, Panama, South Korea, the Philippines, India, Panama, and Uruguay. Again, just to name a few.So there are literally dozens of targets in the United States and around the world for terrorists to attack and Trump s name will be the bulls-eye. Terrorists are going to attack these properties to piss Trump off. And they are hoping Trump will launch war after war in retaliation so that more American treasure is wasted, and more American blood in spilled.Featured Image: Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford,  Paladino wrote. [Obama] dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to Valerie Jarret, who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a Jihady cell mate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her,  he continued.Of Michelle Obama, he said:  I d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla. The racist outburst caused much outrage , and even Paladino s own son could no longer sit silent.Ellicott Development Company CEO William Paladino released a statement condemning his father on Christmas Eve. Ellicott Development takes pride in being a culturally diverse company with over 535 hard-working dedicated employees. We value and respect our employees, friends, partners and all of our commercial and residential tenancies and we do not condone the statements made about the President of the United States and his wife. They were disrespectful and absolutely unnecessary. However, many people pointed out in the comments that Carl Paladino is still the Chairman of the Board at Ellicott and that it s not enough to condemn his remarks if he is still allowed to hold onto his position. Therefore, a boycott has been called for against Ellicott and any business, government, and bank connected to them.Carl Paladino doesn t appear to be bothered by the condemnation either, suggesting that his son is only publicly breaking with him while privately supporting him. There is no reason for the company and its 550 employees to suffer from my politic, especially with the hate spewed by the activists who are devoid of any understanding of our history, our government and our constitution,  the elder Paladino wrote in an email to the New York Post.What Carl Paladino said about the Obama family is disgusting and he should be expelled from any remaining position he has with Ellicott and a stronger condemnation needs to be released from the company. But let s all remember that Carl Paladino worked for Donald Trump s campaign, which means Trump condoned Paladino s racism. That s not surprising, of course, considering Trump pandered to white supremacists throughout his campaign and has some working in his new administration.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Well, one CNN guest has absolutely had it with Trump on that front. CNN host Poppy Harlow mentioned the fact that Putin had tweeted about how the Democrats were handling the unexpected November loss, repeating what Trump had tweeted: Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and the Dems, in my opinion, it s humiliating. Harlow then went on to say: He is agreeing with Vladimir Putin on anything. It s just surprising given the Russian relations, Russian hacking. But that he is talking still about winning the election, the election he won, at a time, I mean, how many geopolitical issues were there in the last week that he could be tweeting about? That s when Harlow s guest, Washington Examiner Senior Correspondent David Drucker, piped up: Vladimir Putin is basically a quasi-dictator, and he s busy lecturing an American candidate about how to lose with dignity? When the man doesn t actually win or doesn t actually lose? He just runs the show. He s the last person! I think you can make an argument here in the U.S. we can all talk about whether Clinton and her team post-election can handle their loss properly. Some believe they have and some believe they haven t. Vladimir Putin is the last person on earth that should be lecturing our candidates about how to lose with dignity. Drucker is right. Putin knows nothing of losing with dignity, because he just murders and jails people who go against him. He s not a real president, as we have in this nation. No matter how much I might have disliked any number of presidents we ve had, I certainly recognized and respected the fact that they were duly elected, and certainly none of them killed people to keep themselves in power. These are things Putin knows nothing about. He would never be able to handle losing, which is why he will never allow it to happen. In the end, the biggest bullies are the real cowards, and yes that stretches to Vladimir Putin. That makes it all the more alarming that the incoming United States president admires such a man on this grand scale.Watch the video below:[ad3media campaign= 1400 ]Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Our goal with this series has always been to expose and combat racism and hatred in all its forms,  the network said.  However, A&E learned last night from the third-party producers who made the documentary that cash payments which we currently understand to be nominal were made in the field to some participants in order to facilitate access. Apparently, A&E could handle the shame of a docuseries attempting to normalize the Klan, but not actually paying them. The network says it stands by the show s content, which allegedly showed the struggles with the internal families  of the Klan, but the cash payments violated company policy: While we stand behind the intent of the series and the seriousness of the content, these payments are a direct violation of A&E s policies and practices for a documentary. We had previously provided assurances to the public and to our core partners including the Anti-Defamation League and Color of Change that no payment was made to hate group members, and we believed that to be the case at the time. We have now decided not to move forward with airing this project.

Bush can teach Donald Trump a thing or two about handling conflicts of interest.As January 20th approaches, Donald Trump is apparently poised to violate the Constitution the moment he finishes reciting the oath of office because he has yet to properly eliminate the conflicts of interest between himself and his family business.Public officials are not allowed to use their office to to influence policies that would increase profits of a company they have a personal stake in. By not putting his assets, including the Trump Organization and any stocks he owns, into a blind trust or sells them off, Trump is violating the the Emoluments Clause and breaking decades of precedent.The most example is when Jimmy Carter sold the peanut business he built from the ground up to avoid conflicts of interest. Of course, Republicans initiated a series of witch hunts against Carter s business anyway in a desperate effort to find a scandal. Today, Republicans don t care if Trump continues to own his business, even though he is already using the presidency to make business deals and bring in profits.Indeed, when Ivanka Trump sat in during a meeting between her father and the Japanese Prime Minister, her company was in the middle of working on a deal with a Japanese company.As Newsweek explained,At the same time, officials with her clothing company were working on a licensing agreement with Sanei International. The largest shareholder of Sanei s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, which is wholly owned by the Japanese government headed by Abe.Trump has also talked to the president of Taiwan and the leader of Argentina, where Trump s company is trying to secure deals to build hotels. Clearly, Trump is flagrantly using the presidency to enrich himself and his company.George H.W. Bush warned his own family not to do this or even make it appear that they are doing it by sending each family member a letter in 1988 in the midst of the presidential election.The elder Bush told his family that people are going to try to be their friend but that  friendship  could result in asking for favors simply because they are connected to the leader of the free world. If there is a legitimate inquiry, call my office,  Bush wrote.  It is certainly appropriate to contact your own government, but let s do it through my office so no one can accuse any of the family of trying to use influence. In other words, Bush told his family not to call him on their friend s behalf. They have to call his office themselves.Bush knew all too well that,  Every effort will be made to find some phone call, some inquiry, some letter that can be made to appear improper. Here s the full letter via Twitter.pic.twitter.com/60GKf4QIIJ  Eric Lipton (@EricLiptonNYT) December 21, 2016Donald Trump, however, is influenced by his business and since his children are deeply involved in the company, that means they ll have special access to him and will be able to curry favors such as asking him to gut certain regulations or asking him to call certain foreign leaders to push through business deals.That s a serious ethics violation that cannot be tolerated. Hell, Eric Trump has already been busted trying to sell access to his father in exchange for $1 million donations to his fraudulent charity. So it s pretty clear that there is already a pay-for-play scandal brewing before Trump has even taken office.This needs to stop now and the only way it will stop is if Trump sells his company or puts it into a blind trust.

Asked to weigh in on whether or not Trump would hinder an investigation into his cozy relationship with Putin and his talented team of hackers, intelligence analyst Malcolm Nance explained that he absolutely would interfere with the investigation faster than Putin interfered with our election: I don t think there will be any accountability with the regards of the Russian hacking against the DNC or even violating the entirety of the U.S. electoral process. He has benefited from that. He s going to shut down any investigation if it implicates him or his campaign. However, Nina is righ.

As long as Trump is manipulated, Russia and China will take our market share from the international markets out there, and the United States will be relegated to a third class country.

Yet they were still able to pretend to be charitable groups in the eyes of the government.The federal government has allowed four groups at the forefront of the white nationalist movement to register as charities and raise more than $7.8 million in tax-deductible donations over the past decade, according to an Associated Press review.Already emboldened by Donald Trump s popularity, group leaders say they hope the president-elect s victory helps them raise even more money and gives them a larger platform for spreading their ideology.With benevolent-sounding names such as the National Policy Institute and New Century Foundation, the tax-exempt groups present themselves as educational organizations and use donors  money to pay for websites, books and conferences to further their ideology. The money also has personally compensated leaders of the four groups.The IRS actually has the power to exclude hate groups from being awarded a non-profit designation, but some experts believe that recent complaints about the IRS scrutinizing conservative scam groups that registered as non-profits has scared off the agency. They also don t have the full resources necessary to police these sort of groups.Even worse, the incoming Trump administration has coddled these groups, inviting them to cover his campaign and the 2016 Republican National Convention.

The Trump team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump has often attacked President Obama and his team, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for not being tougher on extremists.

Such a purge of those seen to be disloyal would be in line with the authoritarian mindset that Trump has so often embraced during the campaign.Trump has also issued a similar demand to the Department of Energy, asking for the names of those who worked on the Obama administration s climate change policy.

All the while, Israel has been fragrantly ignoring what the rest of the world thinks even as America continues to give Israel billions of taxpayer dollars to combine with their own military budget, a military they have repeatedly used to commit genocide against Palestinians.The best solution for peace is a two-state solution, but Israel rejects the idea because they want the land for themselves.And that forced President Obama and United States Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power to abstain from a U.N. vote on a resolution condemning the Israeli settlements. Applause within the United Nations broke out upon passage, proving that the world is tired of the conflict in the Middle East and wants to end it even if it means Israel does not get everything it wants.But Netanyahu threw a hissy fit in a statement on Friday whining about the resolution and accusing President Obama of abandoning Israel. Israel categorically rejects the despicable anti-Israeli resolution at the UN, and will not adhere to it,  the Prime Minister s Office said in a seething statement after the council voted in favor of the motion 14-0. While the Security Council does nothing to prevent the massacre of half a million people in Syria, it is shamefully singling out Israel   the only democracy in the Middle East. The Obama administration not only failed to defend Israel from this harassment at the UN, it cooperated with it behind the scenes. Israel is looking forward to working with President-elect Trump and with out friends in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, to undo the damage of this absurd resolution. In reality, while President Obama still supports Israel s right to exist, he refuses to let Netanyahu bully us. For years, Netanyahu has refused to halt the settlements that prevent peace talks from moving forward. He has also been itching to start a war against Iran so he can sit back and watch as our troops fight and die doing Israel s dirty work.And frankly, if President Obama really hatred Israel, he would have let Iran wipe it off the f*cking map years ago and would never have approved the ridiculous $38 billion in military aid over the next ten years that Israel is about to receive. Also, past presidents have also supported resolutions condemning Israeli settlements, including Ronald Reagan.Perhaps Netanyahu should have respected President Obama instead of insulting him repeatedly over the years like when he delivered an address to Congress rebuking him for working with Iran to reduce their nuclear development. Let s keep in mind that President Obama succeeded in getting Iran to the table and both sides were able to come to a diplomatic agreement. Iran is now complying by giving up their centrifuges. If Netanyahu had his way, we would be at war with Iran, something he can now talk Trump into actually doing.If Netanyahu really wanted peace talks, he would have halted the settlements years ago. But Netanyahu and his right-wing government have no interest in peace. They have become frighteningly similar to the Nazis over the years as they kill Palestinians indiscriminately and advocate genocide against them. One would think that a people whose history is full of tragedies like the Holocaust would avoid trying to commit one themselves. But Netanyahu has dragged Israel to the extreme right-wing.Now Netanyahu is about to have Trump by his side, an egomaniac who hates Muslims as much as he does, which could mean the restart of perpetual war in the Middle East for our military or worse since Trump is obsessed with using nuclear weapons.So it looks like Putin isn t the only foreign leader who got a puppet in the White House.

You don t want judges out there, lawyers becomes judges who think that getting $140,000 a year is a raise,  Christie said.  If you can t make $140,000 as a lawyer with the experience to actually be on the bench, you re not that good a lawyer. You want to appear before stupid judges? Then don t raise their pay anymore. Because the people you will get in the main applying for these jobs will be people who see it as a step up in pay for them,  said Christie.Here s the video:Christie was referring to a defeated bill that would have allowed him and other government officials, including judges, to make money off of book deals. The bill would have also given a big raise to Christie s cabinet members, state and local judges and legislative aides.The bill would also have done some real damage to newspapers in New Jersey, which is currently the only place to find official legal notices. Christie s bill would have made the notices available online, and in a time when journalism is under assault, newspapers can t afford the hit that would cause in readership.But, let s just for a moment assume that Christie is right, and that it takes money to attract the best and the brightest. Well, he certainly doesn t seem to have that attitude when it comes to teachers or to the people who serve his copious amounts of food.Christie has long been engaged in a war against teachers. He even once threatened to  punch  teachers  in the face.  In New Jersey, teachers average less than half what Christie s judges make, and Christie fights tooth and nail to keep their pay low. Shouldn t we aim for smart teachers, as well?Christie has long been against raising the minimum wage in New Jersey, which has the fourth most expensive cost of living in the nation. It s even ahead of California. Still, the minimum wage for New Jersey is just $8.25. Christie vetoed a bill that would have raised the minimum wage.Featured image via Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

According to BroadwayWorld:BroadwayWorld has obtained and confirmed the authenticity of an email sent from the American Guild of Variety Artists to what appears to be Rockettes in its membership as a response to the announcement that some Rockettes do not want to participate in the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.The email reads:  We have received an email from a Rockette expressing concern about getting  involved in a dangerous political climate  but I must remind you that you are all employees, and as a company, Mr. Dolan obviously wants the Rockettes to be represented at our country s Presidential inauguration, as they were in 2001 & 2005.

Doing the best performance to reflect an American Institution which has been here for over 90 years is your job. I hope this pulls into focus the bottom line on this work.

Finding out that it has been decided for us that Rockettes will be performing at the Presidential inauguration makes me feel embarrassed and disappointed.

Recently the Eric Trump Foundation announced an auction for coffee with his sister, incoming First Lady Ivanka, who will be serving as an adviser to her father and occupying the space in the White House normally reserved for the President s spouse.To any casual onlooker, this is exactly the sort of situation that used to cause Trump to scream  lock her up,  but now that he s President, the obvious conflict of interest presented by the sale of access to those closest to the President-elect doesn t matter much to him. On Friday, The Donald took to Twitter to whine that his family can t sell access to his administration:My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016Now, nothing is stopping any of the Trumps from donating their own money, or encouraging direct donations to St. Jude, the organization that was allegedly going to receive the money (anytime the Trumps and charity are mentioned,  allegedly  is appropriate until it actually happens). But for them to think it is in any way OK to sell access to Ivanka no matter the reason is just asinine. It s conflicts like this that caused Obama to prohibit members of his family from directly raising money for anyone, no matter the cause:The Obama administration prohibited any member of the first family from directly soliciting charitable donations, said Norm Eisen, who served as an ethics lawyer early in President Obama s tenure. Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, have attended occasional charitable fund-raising events, including the Congressional Black Caucus annual dinners. The Obamas also allowed their daughters  high school to auction off magazines they had signed, Mr. Eisen said, but they did not auction off access to themselves. You never, ever want to have government officials using their public office for the private gain, even for a worthy charity,  Mr. Eisen said.  That was how we did it. Eric Trump, like his father, whined that he can t raise money by selling his sister despite getting by just fine without that sort of thing in the past. I get that people will try to use anything they can for their own interests,  Trump said.  The reality is, I ve been raising money for sick kids far longer than  his dad has been involved in politics,  Eric Trump told the New York Times, though he did explain that he understands  the quagmire  presented by what he had hoped he would not get caught doing.Naturally, in what is almost becoming a daily ritual, Twitter swarmed Trump s morning bloviating whinefest and once again hammered him into oblivion:@realDonaldTrump Sorry your children can't get the tax deduction on your name.

The Daily Beast reports:Though the Eric Trump Foundation s website says,  We exclusively support St. Jude Children s Research Hospital,  that isn t the case. In 2012, ETF began donating in earnest to other causes, cutting small checks to 40 individual charities in addition to the outsize donation given to the children s hospital. Some of these small donations like the $1,600 to the American Society for Enology and Viticulture, a California wine industry organization where Eric Trump once gave a keynote address have seemingly little to do with the charity s mission of helping sick children.By 2013, it had given $15,000 to The Little Baby Face Foundation, a controversial charity run by a Manhattan plastic surgeon that provides surgery for children with big noses, large ears, and other more serious facial deformities so they can face bullies at school one which critics have warned sends a warped message to such young children.Despite the claim that all the gifts in ETF s silent auction would be donated, the foundation also paid $25,000 to an artist s foundation in exchange for a portrait of Donald Trump that was sold at the 2012 Golf Invitational to Eric Trump, who hung it over his livingroom sofa. Eric Trump did not respond to a request for comment seeking the purchase price.Would the money have actually gone to St. Jude?

The biggest name on Trump s list of possibilities was renowned Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli, but according to The New York Post, because of backlash from fans on social media, he has also declined to perform.A source told the Post: Bocelli said there was no way he d take the gig . . . he was  getting too much heat  and he said no. With no real talent showing up, other than The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Rockettes and America s Got Talent singer Jackie Evancho, it s sad enough, but now it looks like former presidents are also resisting the event. So far, and we re less than a month away from this debacle, it looks like Jimmy Carter is the only former president who has confirmed that he will be in attendance.Politico reports:Carter, who endorsed Clinton, announced at his Sunday school class in Georgia earlier this month that he would attend the inauguration.Following tradition, all former presidents are invited to attend the ceremony on Jan. 20 when Trump will be sworn in. But not all living presidents have consistently attended the inaugurations of their successors.President Barack Obama in 2009 enjoyed the presence of all four living presidents  both Bushes, Carter and Clinton   at his first inauguration, but the Bushes skipped Obama s second event in 2013, citing George H.W. Bush s compromised health.Since Trump s election, the Clinton family have been virtually out of the public eye and because of the nasty events leading up to the election, this is not surprising. After the way Hillary has been treated by Trump and his supporters, it would make sense for former president Bill Clinton to decline to be in attendance, though some say this would be  petty  on their behalf and would make Hillary look bad if she didn t show up. A spokesman for Bill Clinton declined to comment to Politico regarding whether they would be there or not.Neither of the two Bushes endorsed Donald Trump, most likely due to the brutal way Trump mocked fellow Republican candidate Jeb Bush, and while George Sr. has already announced that he would not be at the ceremony, Bush s spokesman, Freddy Ford said that George W. Bush was still weighing his options and would probably not make a decision until January.Trump s inaugural committee did not respond to Politico s request for comment, but it doesn t appear as if anyone wants to celebrate his so-called  massive victory.

We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.Indeed, while Republicans are only too happy to increase military spending way beyond our needs, they are more than willing to sacrifice the care of the American people to do it.Low income families rely on the school lunch program to make sure their kids have something good to eat during the day. Eating well helps children learn better and develop healthy eating habits.But Republican don t care.Republicans are targeting the school lunch program because they claim the kids aren t eating the food because it s too healthy. They also claim that the program  risks becoming insolvent,  which is bullshit because Congress funds the program.Also, while there are always complaints when change occurs, experts agree that schools are adapting and and number of complaints have dropped.According to Huffington Post,Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the GOP attack on the program was  out of touch with the progress that s been made  improving school lunches.Wootan acknowledged there were well-founded complaints about the program s stricter standards, but the gripes have declined as schools have adapted. She described Freedom Caucus opposition as  purely political anti-government sentiment  that upends the program s historical support from both parties.Indeed, it appears Republicans only want to gut the program because Michelle Obama made it her focus over the last eight years to improve the nutritional value of school lunches.In other words, Republicans are being petty because they hate President Obama and the First Lady.In fact, food waste in America s schools has always been a problem but a study in 2014 published by the American Journal of Preventative Medicine found that the new meal standards ushered in by Michelle Obama did make food waste worse.So Republicans are attacking the program for no real reason and are apparently willing to hurt the well-being and health of children if it means hurting Michelle Obama.These conservatives are truly sick monsters.Featured Image: ChildrensAdvocate.org""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

While a recovering economy (in which all households have been benefiting) is helping to fuel these job booms, a gap in job skills and a passive recruitment process is causing not every position to be filled.Jobs in manufacturing are paying more employees more money. Back in 2008, half of U.S. manufacturing firms paid employees $25 or less. Now, eight years later, only 30 percent of firms are paying less than $25.At the same time, unskilled workers are missing out on better opportunities while skilled positions aren t being filled, stifling a resurgence of manufacturing in the rust belt.So while there are still plateaus the industry must overcome, the  economic anxiety  felt by the Midwest that supposedly fueled Trump s rise to the presidency has been based on a lie prorogated by conservative outlets like Fox and Trump himself (and a little by the far left).While Democrats have been delivering to the rustbelt and fighting for the coal miners of West Virginia, Republicans have drummed up fear, lies and distrust to rise to power.Once again, President Obama has cleaned up the Republican Party s mess   and just like with George W.

While The Donald planned to resurrect the Bush-era National Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS)   a program that was condemned heavily for targeting Muslims   Obama decided that he might as well just eliminate it before Trump can make good on his promise to bring it back.On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security published a new regulation that completely eliminates NSEERS, which has lain dormant since President Obama suspended the program in 2011:The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is removing outdated regulations relating to an obsolete special registration program for certain nonimmigrants. DHS ceased use of the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) program in 2011 after finding that the program was redundant, captured data manually that was already captured through automated systems, and no longer provided an increase in security in light of DHS s evolving assessment of the threat posed to the United States by international terrorism. The regulatory structure pertaining to NSEERS no longer provides a discernable public benefit as the program has been rendered obsolete.Accordingly, DHS is removing the special registration program regulations.The best part? This new rule takes effect almost immediately, so there is nothing at all Trump can do to stop Obama from scuttling his hopes of using NSEERS to create his Nazi-esque program.This seems to be a response to a plea from New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to President Obama. In a letter addressed to the President, Schneiderman pointed out (very correctly): We can t risk giving President-elect Trump the tools to create an unconstitutional religious registry. Schneiderman praised the President s decision Thursday: This is a win for civil rights and for smart, effective law enforcement, as well as for the strong coalition of advocacy organizations and others who fought to dismantle this discriminatory tool,  he said.  My office will continue do everything it can to protect the rights of all New Yorkers, and ensure equal justice under the law for all, regardless of religion or national origin.

The end of Social Security is near because of Donald Trump.Trump supporters are living in a fantasy land if they really believe Trump and the Republican Congress are going to protect Social Security.For decades, Social Security has been a lifeline for the elderly during hard times. During the Great Recession in 2008, Social Security kept people over the age of 65 afloat as millions of Americans took hits that drained their bank accounts or left them homeless.For senior citizens, Social Security did exactly what is was meant to do, prevent them from ending up in poverty.Every American in this country pays into Social Security so that they can benefit from the program one day.But Republicans are already planning on gutting Social Security in 2017 with a bill known as the Social Security Reform Act of 2016.The bill will raise the retirement age, which means American workers will have to work longer and harder before they can stop and draw the Social Security they worked so hard for. And it won t even be worth it because the bill also slashes benefits by 35 percent and will be cut by 50 percent for younger workers. In short, Americans will get less but have to work more.And Republicans are hoping to pass this bill handily without anyone noticing. Not only are they banking on Trump serving as a distraction, they are betting that he ll sign whatever they put in front of his face. The banana Republicans are going on a stealth offensive,  Olbermann began.  They have to reveal themselves sooner or later, if only to signal to corporations who own them that, yes, the fix is in and ownership will be getting what they prostituted the government for. Olbermann explained that chief actuary of the Social Security Administration Stephen C. Goss sent a letter to bill sponsor Rep. Sam Johnson warning him that his so-called  reform  plan will actually harm Social Security and hurt the millions of Americans who use it. Paul Ryan and all the other corporate whores intend to plunge the knife into the back of Social Security, and especially those hard working fools of Middle America who actually believed the net impact of a Donald Trump presidency would be more money for them and not poverty in their old age,  Olbermann continued.  Social Security would be gutted. Less money would be flowing into Social Security and Americans would see massive cuts, some of which would begin as early as December 2018. So millions of Americans will take a major hit two years from now, and right around the Christmas season to add insult to injury.And Olbermann added that Trump supporters will be too busy fawning over their new hero to notice that they are being swindled. They will be watching whatever Trump is doing at the moment   at some point likely to be his version of Daffy Duck drinking a gallon of gasoline and a bottle of nitroglycerin, a pile of gunpowder and a glass of uranium-238 and then lighting a match   and in the background, the Republican House and Republican Senate now full of the subsidiaries of the corporations who were able to buy this country after Citizens United, they will destroy Social Security so the rich can get even richer by stealing a billion dollars one dollar at a time. Our part-time president will take a quick look away from his Twitter feed to sign exactly where they tell him to sign. Here s the video via YouTube.Republicans are prepared to launch an all-out assault on not only Social Security but on Medicare and Medicaid as well. So senior citizens and every American who manages to survive to old age after Republicans destroy everything, will not have Social Security or healthcare. This is what Republicans mean when they say they will  take care of  the middle class. The reality is that Republicans are selfish and they only care about the wealthy. The time for peaceful protests is over.

Of course, we all know of the deeply disturbing proposals Trump has made with regards to American Muslims, with the suggestions of a Muslim ban and a registry of Muslims seemingly still on the table, and many seemed to see this as the Prince s way of warning against those dangerous and bigoted ideas. This sort of thing is right out of Adolf Hitler s playbook, and anyone who cannot see that definitely needs to wake up. Prince Charles continued: The story of the Nativity unfolds with the fleeing of the holy family to escape violent persecution    and to have similar compassion for people fleeing persecution in their homelands today.

Unfortunately, as happens too often in America, he just decided to brutalize her and her family instead of dealing with the situation she was reporting.According to Jacqueline Craig, a neighbor put her 7-year-old son in a chokehold after he allegedly tossed a piece of paper on the ground and refused to pick it up. Now, a grown man assaulting a child is a serious issue, but you wouldn t know that by the (white) responding officers response. After Craig explains what happened, the cop asks the dumbest question in the history of stupid utterances by police: Why don t you teach your son not to litter? Let s ignore for a moment that there is zero evidence that the child actually littered   that s just the justification used by Craig s neighbor. The officer didn t ask  is your son ok?  He didn t bother to do anything related to getting to the bottom of the situation. Something about Craig and her son caused the officer to decide that the boy was guilty. Naturally, this didn t sit well with Craig. He can t prove to me that my son littered,  Craig angrily told the officer.  But it doesn t matter if he did or didn t. It doesn t give him the right to put his hands on him. Why not?  the cop asks.As Craig began to yell a bit (I mean,  why not,  for f*ck s sake), the officer informed her that her lecture  pissed him off  and Craig s daughter quickly stepped in front of her mother to calm her down because at this point it was clear where things were headed.Though it was clear to everyone including the officer (the girl had her back to him) that the girl did not pose a threat the cop did what cops do best these days and became unnecessarily violent, throwing  both Craig and her daughter on the ground and pointing a taser at Craig s head and wildly swinging the weapon around to aim it at lookers-on.As the video ends, the unnamed officer looks into the camera and tells the person filming,  You re going to jail too  as he knocks the camera out of her hands.Here s a little tip for cops who protest until companies stop selling civil rights-related merchandise: if you have a problem with that but refuse to condemn an officer like this, then you re part of the problem.Fort Worth Police Department s Internal Affairs Unit is currently investigating the  unusual arrest  of the women.

I think we should go back and look at what Don Jr. and Eric have done and wanted to continue to do, which is raise money for charities,  Conway remarked in an attempt to evade Cuomo s question about the illegal scheme.  The Eric Trump Foundation is 10 years old. It has done enormously great work. Cuomo pointed out that Conway herself whined when Clinton s team made the same argument. It s the same thing the Clinton people said when they were defending their allegations of pay-for-play. They (Eric and Donald Jr.) were selling off a million dollar trip to hunt with the boys and hang out with the president. That sounds like paying for access.

But that tall tale was rated false back in June.Then Cuomo grilled Conway.CUOMO:  So paying a million dollars to hang out with the president is okay? CONWAY:  I didn t say that. CUOMO:  I know, you re not answering. You re going after the Clintons. I m saying, what s your answer? CONWAY:  You mentioned the Clinton Foundation, you said it s the same. I m saying it s absolutely not the same. Then Cuomo dropped the hammer. You re giving the same defense that they gave. When you made the allegations against the Clintons, they said,  We do lots of great work. We took these meetings.

Eric Trump does great work with his foundation and paying a lot of money to hang out with the president is okay.  If it s all okay, why are they backing away? Conway then whined that the media isn t treating Trump and his family fairly, which has been the main strategy when they are caught being hypocrites.Here s the video via YouTube.Eric Trump and his unfortunately named brother clearly knew what they were doing was wrong and that they were going to get busted running a pay-for-play scheme. That s the only reason why they backed out. And Kellyanne Conway knows it, which is why her defense was so pathetic.

So she was able to put Blackburn in her place with firsthand knowledge that every immigrant, even from Australia, are thoroughly vetted. Can I stop you on that, really quick?  Keilar asked.  Because you said many refugees are not vetted, and I know certainly there are concerns. The vast majority of refugees are peaceful, there are many people arguing there are risks when you open yourself up to people coming into the country. But you say they re not vetted and yet, I ve gone through the process and it s pretty extensive. Keilar also informed Blackburn that several government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security are involved in the process.Mic. Dropped.And, of course, Blackburn responded by insisting that all these government agencies aren t doing their jobs and proceeded to treat Keilar like a child who doesn t know anything.Keilar once again countered Blackburn by pointing out that CNN has looked into these claims and what they found proves that Blackburn is only trying to spread fear to advance the GOP s anti-immigration agenda. When there is someone and they don t know who they are or where they re coming from, they don t let them in,  Keilar said.  There s a process to make sure. Do you know of specific instances where people are completely bypassing what is actually a quite labyrinth process to get into this county? But rather than answer the question, Blackburn demonstrated that she s full of shit by evading it completely, insisting that Keilar visit an immigration reception center and question the case workers.Keilar reminded Blackburn that immigrants are vetted by the DHS and the FBI along with several other government agencies. That s when Blackburn threw them under the bus by accusing them of not doing their jobs properly. She also repeatedly danced around Keilar s question, proving that Blackburn can t point to any specific examples of a Syrian immigrant being poorly vetted.Here s the video via YouTube.The fact is that immigrants face a two-year wait as they are vetted thoroughly to gain entrance into this country. They are then settled into this country after the long and grueling process and are often the targets of harassment and abuse even though they went through hell to get to the land of freedom and opportunity.If and when a Muslim refugee commits an act of terror, it s not that they came here with that intent. It s most likely that they were radicalized many years after they arrived here, and that s because they ve had to deal with the constant discrimination and hate from people like Blackburn who demonize Muslims and blame them for every problem. Stuff like that pushes people over the edge.Plus, immigrants are less likely to commit a crime than a citizen who was born here. But you don t hear Blackburn or her Republican colleagues calling for years of extensive vetting for every baby born on American soil. They certainly haven t called for vetting white supremacists after they commit acts of terrorism. That s because Republicans are hypocrites and are just using Muslims as a scapegoat for political gain.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In 2008 I was never subjected to the kind of concentrated vilification of Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, the whole conservative-media ecosystem, and so as a consequence, even for my first two years as a senator I was polling at 70 percent,  Obama said.They weren t seeing some image of me as trying to take away their stuff and give it to black people, and coddle criminals, and all the stereotypes of not just African American politicians but liberal politicians. You started to see that kind of prism being established towards the end of the 2008 race, particularly once Sarah Palin was the nominee. And obviously almost immediately after I was elected, it was deployed in full force. And it had an impact in terms of how a large portion of white voters would see me. And so when people criticize or respond negatively to me, usually they re responding to this character that they re seeing on TV called Barack Obama, or to the office of the presidency and the White House and what that represents. And so you don t take it personally. You understand that if people are angry that somehow the government is failing, then they are going to look to the guy who represents government. And that applies, by the way, even to some of the folks who are now Trump supporters. They re responding to a fictional character named Barack Obama who they see on Fox News or who they hear about through Rush Limbaugh.Indeed, conservatives websites and political shows constantly twisted President Obama s words and turned him into a monster who was going to take away everyone s guns any second and declare himself king. Every time more jobs were added to the economy or the stock market rose, or unemployment dropped or anything good happened in this country, conservatives ignored it or accused Obama of cooking the books or made it sound like a bad thing in order to make people hate President Obama.They were wrong, of course. But conservatives went on hating President Obama anyway because they refused to listen to anything outside the conservative echo chamber. As a result, conservatives reject facts and think the truth is whatever Fox News tells them it is.And now the same conservative echo chamber that vilified President Obama is now praising Trump like he s a gift from God who has never done anything wrong and doesn t lie.

Just to give you an idea who these people are and what they represent, the SPLC collected a few of their more notable lines from their collection of racist propaganda: America was defined   almost explicitly, sometimes very explicitly   as a white nation, for white people, and what that means is that there is virtually no figure, no law, no policy, no event in the history of the old, white America that can survive the transition to the new and non-white version. Whether we will want to call the new updated version  America  at all is another question entirely.    Sam Francis, VDARE.com, July 21, 2003 Jewish activity collectively, throughout history, is best understood as an elaborate and highly successful group competitive strategy directed against neighboring peoples and host societies. The objective has been control of economic resources and political power. One example: overwhelming Jewish support for non-traditional immigration, which has the effect of weakening America s historic white majority.    Kevin MacDonald, VDARE.com, Nov. 14, 2006 What race realists find most infuriating about the liberalism of the last half century is not just that it has lost its instinctive appreciation for the culture and people of the West but actively, viciously attacks them. Whites are doing something no other people have ever done in human history. Our rulers and elites welcome replacement by aliens, they vilify our ancestors and their own, they sacrifice our interests to those of favored minorities, and they treat the entire history of the West as if it were a global plague of rapine and exploitation. This is a disease that is killing us, and we must fight it head on.    Jared Taylor, VDARE.com, July 4, 2008The cast of cartoonish gasbags in this almost terrifyingly surreal mess includes a guy who once claimed that black people are incapable of sustaining any society, someone who wrote a trilogy (wow, a whole trilogy, huh?) of anti-Semitic blood libel, and the writings of a deceased prominent white supremacist who has a terrifying  final  solution to the  race  problem: If whites wanted to do so, they could dictate a solution to the racial problem tomorrow   by curtailing immigration and sealing the border, by imposing adequate fertility controls on nonwhites and encouraging a higher white birth rate, by refusing to be bullied into enduring  multiculturalism,  affirmative action, civil rights laws and policies; and by refusing to submit to cultural dissolution, inter-racial violence and insults, and the guilt that multiracialists inculcate. Naturally, since this matches Coulter s rhetoric almost entirely, you can see why she d want to attend their little Christmas shindig, which was hosted by founder Peter Brimelow. At the event, Coulter gave an interview to VDARE contributor John Derbyshire, who was fired by the National Review after his take on the Trayvon Martin murder:Derbyshire joined VDARE after being fired by the National Review in 2012 for writing a racist screed in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting titled,  The Talk: Nonblack Version.  The article, presented as a talk from a white parent to their child included lines like,  A small cohort of blacks   in my experience, around five percent   is ferociously hostile to whites and will go to great lengths to inconvenience or harm us.  It also included tips like,  If planning a trip to a beach or amusement park at some date, find out whether it is likely to be swamped with blacks on that date. Coulter once suggested in a tweet that only people with four grandparents born in the United States be allowed to vote.If only people with at least 4 grandparents born in America were voting, Trump would win in a 50-state landslide.  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) November 8, 2016In Germany, this was known as the Mischling test, a way to sort  pureblood  Germans out from Jews.

All the dogs were guilty of was moving. They argued in court that the officers  actions violated the Fourth Amendment, that is was an unlawful seizure of property.In the case of the Browns  two pit bulls, the imminent threat came from the dogs barking and moving around. One officer shot the first pit bull after he said it  had only moved a few inches  in a movement that he considered to be a  lunge.  The injured dog retreated to the basement, where the officer shot and killed it as well as the second dog while conducting a sweep of the residence. Officer Klein testified that after he shot and killed the first dog, he noticed the second dog standing about halfway across the basement,  the court s opinion explained.

Trump has been at war with Scotland for years over their offshore windfarms, but it s worse than simple repeated requests to Scotland to not do this to him and his poor golfers. According to The Guardian, Trump spent years sending former First Minister Alex Salmond letters full of insults, cajoling, and even threats.In one letter, dated February 9, 2012, Trump wrote: With the reckless installation of these [wind turbine] monsters, you will single-handedly have done more damage to Scotland than virtually any event in Scottish history! You seem hellbent on destroying Scotland s coastline and therefore Scotland itself I have just authorized my staff to allocate a substantial amount of money to launch an international campaign to fight your plan to surround Scotland s coast with many thousands of wind turbines. That s a direct threat right there, but he put a veiled one in another letter dated Sept. 14, 2011: In short, this wind farm should not be built, or alternatively, be relocated. If not, you should ask yourself if any other international developer would ever risk investing in Scotland after my experience and all the promises that were made to me! Another letter, addressed to Phillip Hammond, who was the U.K. s defense secretary at the time, said that Salmond had a  bloated ego.  That s rich   nobody s ego is as bloated as that of King Cheeto.On March 15, 2013, he ended yet another letter pleading with Salmond not to plunge ahead with ruining the views from his golf course with: I truly believe it is very important that you not destroy the beauty of Scotland, its land or its seas, by placing thousands of these horrendous looking industrial structures in so many places which will ruin the magnificence and beauty of Scotland. Do not be the man who destroyed Scotland   do not be  Mad Alex!' He would also try and cajole Salmond into caving to his demands. After saying that  the world s greatest leaders have always been those who have been able to change their minds for the good,  and blasting wind power yet again, Trump said: I will be your greatest cheerleader if you can change or modify your stance on at least the inappropriately placed turbines. Salmond made the mistake of letting Trump bulldoze away an environmentally protected area because he believed Trump s promise of bringing thousands of jobs to Scotland and investing hundreds of millions in their economy. The golf course only has 95 employees, most are part-time or seasonal, there s a single-story clubhouse and a small boutique hotel, and Trump spend a whopping  30 million. Trump promised a huge development with a premier hotel. Trump promised a lot more than the government previous to Salmond ever did, and he broke it all.How s Trump going to be in the White House, when other countries don t do what he wants them to do? This isn t about wind power itself   it s about Trump, his ego, and his willingness to harass another country s leader in an attempt to bend them to his will.Salmond only responded to one of the letters, in April 2012. It s hard to blame him for ignoring most of these because, quite simply, Trump is ridiculous. Salmond later warned U.S. voters not to vote for Trump. He noted Trump s immaturity and bullying nature, and flat-out called him a  man-child,  which, let s be honest, is true. These dealings with Trump over his golf course convinced Salmond that Trump does not have what it takes to be President of the United States.To read all of the letters in their entirety, click here.Featured image by Jeff J Mitchell via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""On Tuesday night, Fox News blowhard and right-wing messiah Bill O Reilly made it very clear that Republicans  primary focus comes down to one thing: the white-dominated power structure, and those dastardly liberals, he says, are out to destroy it.O Reilly says that liberals want to get rid of the Electoral College   which has twice in recent memory allowed someone completely unqualified to assume office despite losing the popular vote   because they want power taken away from the white establishment. The left in America is demanding that the Electoral College system put into place in 1787 be scrapped. But there is a hidden reason for this,  O Reilly said, adding that voting patterns reveal that most minority votes go to the Democratic Party. This is unsurprising to anyone who pays attention to the way Republicans talk about Muslims, Hispanics, women, African-Americans, and pretty much anyone whose skin tone is darker than a piece of classroom chalk. But to O Reilly, it s a conspiracy against white people   a conspiracy to silence white rural voters by counting each and every person s vote equally, no matter where they live: Very few commentators will tell you that the heart of liberalism in America today is based on race. It permeates almost every issue. That white men have set up a system of oppression. That system must be destroyed. O Reilly may scorn the idea, but white men really have set up a system of oppression. Time magazine notes that the Electoral College largely exists to benefit white slave owners in the south:At the Philadelphia convention, the visionary Pennsylvanian James Wilson proposed direct national election of the president. But the savvy Virginian James Madison responded that such a system would prove unacceptable to the South:  The right of suffrage was much more diffusive [i.e., extensive] in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of Negroes.  In other words, in a direct election system, the North would outnumber the South, whose many slaves (more than half a million in all) of course could not vote. But the Electoral College a prototype of which Madison proposed in this same speech instead let each southern state count its slaves, albeit with a two-fifths discount, in computing its share of the overall count.[ ]Virginia emerged as the big winner the California of the Founding era with 12 out of a total of 91 electoral votes allocated by the Philadelphia Constitution, more than a quarter of the 46 needed to win an election in the first round. After the 1800 census, Wilson s free state of Pennsylvania had 10% more free persons than Virginia, but got 20% fewer electoral votes. Perversely, the more slaves Virginia (or any other slave state) bought or bred, the more electoral votes it would receive. Were a slave state to free any blacks who then moved North, the state could actually lose electoral votes.If the system s pro-slavery tilt was not overwhelmingly obvious when the Constitution was ratified, it quickly became so. For 32 of the Constitution s first 36 years, a white slaveholding Virginian occupied the presidency. White men have largely abandoned the Democrats, and the left believes it s because of racism that they want to punish minorities, keep them down, O Reilly told his mindless audience, apparently forgetting that conservatives regularly list the ways they want to punish minorities and keep them down (voter I.D. laws, for example). Summing up: Left wants power taken away from the white establishment. They want a profound change in the way America is run. Taking voting power away from the white precincts is the quickest way to do that. This isn t the first time O Reilly has made similar complaints. In 2007, he and John McCain joined together to prattle on about how liberals want to break down the  white Christian male power structure  that has been long-established in our country. In 2012, he complained to Megyn Kelly that the  white establishment is now the minority. O Reilly s latest rant was so stupid that the typically nonsensical and terrible  SooperMexican  over at RightScoop put him on blast:Is that really what conservatism is conserving? White establishment power? Here I thought it was about free markets, free people, and getting the government out of our way. Well, I feel stupid. I wish the GOP had mentioned this earlier.Well darn. As you probably know, I m a minority conservative, and I really hate and despise how the left makes all politics about racial identity, as I wrote here. But the age of Trump makes it sound like  conservatism  is being redefined as pro-white identity politics. This can t be a coincidence, right?Watch O Reilly s latest racist rant below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

If only the Times had reported on the Nazi death camps with the same fervor as its failed last-minute attempt to conjure up alleged victims of Donald Trump, imagine how many lives could have been saved.

Donald Trump and his nomination of Rex Tillerson of ExxonMobil for Secretary of State seems to be an effort to double down on oil production.

They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region s harsh conditions is limited.

The plan is to have acts at the inauguration that are meaningful for Trump, and he s a huge fan of Bocelli. But unfortunately for Trump, this too is falling apart. Despite being friends with Trump for years, Bocelli has chosen to bail on him due to the intense backlash the singer faced on social media.

Well, that s just great.MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle pressed aide Anthony Scaramucci on why Trump hasn t held a news conference since July 27th and the president-elect canceled one scheduled for December 15th.Scaramucci suggested that Trump canceled the news conference because  he s a very precise, very detail-oriented guy  who wants to have  all of the answers to all of the types of questions that s he s gonna get thrown,  according to Politico. Hold on. If he s a detail-oriented guy, then how does this statement that we ve been hearing for months   don t take him literally, take him seriously   make sense?  Ruhle asked.  Because that s sort of the opposite. Then Scaramucci blamed the media.

Carleson, a former covert CIA officer who has been on the ground in hot spots around the world, including Iraq and Afghanistan, and understands that facts are the difference between life and death.In an article for Fortune, Carleson warned that Trump s obsession with Twitter while ignoring his intelligence briefings are more serious than many Americans believe. In a world where Breitbart headlines can create lurid stories out of thin air, the daily brief s stubborn reliance on facts and expert analysis might seem positively archaic,  Carleson began.So far, Trump has ignored most of his daily briefings, a trait that proved disastrous in 2001 when terrorists brought down the World Trade Center with airplanes on September 11th. Months prior to the attack, Bush ignored a memo that al-Qaeda was determined to strike the United States using airplanes.The bottom line is that if Trump does not take intelligence briefings seriously and refuses to listen to them because he thinks he is smarter than the people who have been doing this work for decades, we re going to see real consequences and it will start with the people on the ground like Carleson, who risk their lives to gain intelligence to pass on to policymakers in order to prevent terrorist attacks and wars. To a person, every asset I ever recruited or worked with genuinely believed that, in providing information to the United States government, he or she was doing something that in the long run would help right wrongs, improve circumstances both locally and globally, and possibly avert large-scale tragedies,  Carleson wrote.  I fear that Trump s rejection of both the content and the conclusions offered to him by the intelligence community will have a profound chilling effect on the recruitment of new assets, and the willingness of existing assets to continue to provide information. This disregard has consequences beyond Trump s own dearth of information, because once again, it serves to erode the motivation of those who might provide us with information we desperately need information that may include details of threats to American lives and infrastructure, for example small and, yes, sometimes repetitive details that cumulatively inform us of impending terrorist attacks, progress on covert weapons programs, cyberthreats, and countless other plots and dangers faced by our nation every day. But why should either potential assets or foreign intelligence services trust the CIA if our own president does not?And Carleson is absolutely right. Why should foreign assets trust the CIA with information that Trump is going to ignore?Because if the United States is not going to act because Trump writes off everything the CIA says as lies, assets would probably rather take the information elsewhere or simply let the United States be attacked and become the victim of our own refusal to accept facts. And that will only help nations like Russia and China and other nations that would love to watch our country burn.The world knows that, in the incoming administration, facts will be ignored, and reasoned analysis will be rejected. If Trump continues to publicly scorn the CIA s briefings and conclusions, assets and cooperative foreign intelligence services will become increasingly disinclined to provide sensitive information. Without confidence that their cooperation will have any kind of positive effect, the risks quickly outweigh the results. On an individual level, the why determines the what, and without the motivation of knowing that their sacrifices will ultimately make a difference, CIA sources may choose, in Trump s parlance, to walk away from the deal.This is exactly why Trump should never have been allowed to become president. And it s why conservatives are unfit to have any power within our government. Facts do not matter to them, and we live in a time when facts matter most. If America is attacked or our enemies walk all over us, it will be Trump s fault. He will be to blame along with all the Republicans who kissed his ass.

Howard and two teammates, Tanner Ward and an unnamed 16-year-old student, pretended to give their African-American teammate a hug, then held him down and raped him with a coat hanger in the locker room. According to a lawsuit filed by the victim s mother, this is the culmination of months of race-based harassment. KTVB reports:According to prosecutors, the sexual assault happened Oct. 23, 2015 in the high school locker room. The lawsuit describes one teammate pretending to offer the victim a hug, then holding him down as another boy inserted a coat hanger into his rectum. A third attacker then kicked the coat hanger several times, forcing it farther into the victim s body and causing rectal injuries that required treatment at a hospital, lawyers say. The Plaintiff screamed and cried out but no staff member came to his assistance or even attempted to investigate the clamor from within the locker room,  attorneys R. Keith Roark and E. Lee Schlender wrote in the filing.The attorney general s office filed charges against three students in March after a months-long investigation. John R. K. Howard and Tanner Ward are both charged as adults with forcible sexual penetration, and could face up to life in prison if convicted. The third student is charged as a juvenile.According to the lawsuit, the victim was regularly called  Kool-Aid,   chicken-eater,   watermelon,  and the classic  n*gger  by teammates for the better part of the year leading up to the attack. Several teammates would regularly jump on the victim s back and  hump  him during practice and he was forced to endure painful wedgies. Howard personally posted a Confederate flag on the victim s Facebook profile and demanded he learn and recite the song,  Moonman Notorious KKK,  which makes a reference to lynching.  They even drew this adorable little picture of him sitting in the back of a bus:On Friday, Howard   whom the lawsuit notes   is a relative of prominent individuals in the community    managed to escape jail time and even registering as a sex offender by pleading guilty to a lesser crime. We don t believe it s appropriate for Mr. Howard to suffer the consequences of a sex offender,  Deputy Attorney General Casey Hemmer said of the attack, noting that he doesn t feel the  egregious  attack was a sex crime no matter how much coat hanger rape was involved.  But he still needs to be held accountable. After completing 300 hours of community service, Howard will likely be able to have his conviction dismissed and he will be allowed to maintain his innocence despite the evidence against him. In other words, not only does he manage to avoid any form of actual punishment, but he can now torment his victim by telling everyone that he is innocent of the crime and nothing can be done about it. Now that s accountability right there!Watch a report on the attack below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Last week, though, A&E, home of the  Duck Dynasty  clan, announced that they are giving a voice to the real Klan. The Ku Klux Klan is getting their own show.Beginning in January, A&E will be broadcasting a show called  Generation KKK.  This show isn t exactly like  Duck Dynasty.  Instead of a long-running reality show, this is being billed as an eight-part documentary. A&E denied that they will be giving a platform to the Klan, but it s doubtful the Klan would have agreed to do the documentary if it didn t humanize them.That meant finding a delicate balance between winning the trust of the Klan members and ensuring the show didn t propagate views the network s executives abhor.  We certainly didn t want the show to be seen as a platform for the views of the KKK,  said Rob Sharenow, general manager of A&E.  The only political agenda is that we really do stand against hate. The struggles we were most drawn to were the struggles with the internal families,  said Mr. James, an executive producer of the series, whose previous credits include TLC s  I Am Jazz,  about the transgender teenager Jazz Jennings.  We had a stance, and we were clear with folks that we were hoping for them to see the light and to come out of this world. It s an incredibly destructive environment for anybody to be in, let alone children. Source: New York TimesOn one level, this might make sense. Perhaps some KKK members will become more sympathetic to people of color or LGBT people just by getting to know them, but there is a far greater risk, and that is normalization of the Klan.No one is saying this show is the result of Trump s election. In fact, it s been in the works since about the time Trump began his run, but there is a media trend of normalizing the deplorable (yes, that is the correct word). Even so-called liberal NPR has begun normalizing the  alt-right    hell, even the term alt-right normalizes racism, xenophobia, nationalism, misogyny and homophobia. Just a week after the election, NPR ran a story on Steve Bannon, who has long been giving a voice to neo-nazis and other deplorables through his blog, Breitbart.com. NPR called Bannon a  national hero. Let s hear a defense of Steve Bannon,  NPR host Steve Inskeep began, offering a view of exactly what direction this interview would take. Pollak started by launching into a gushing assessment of Bannon, calling him  a national hero,  and talking about how it s so great we ll have someone  so calm under pressure in the White House.  (Maybe this is true, though it contradicts accusations against Bannon of domestic abuse, sexual harassment and being a  verbally abus[ive]   bully   who is prone to a lot of tirades  by former staffers.) When Inskeep interjected to ask about Bannon s tireless work to turn Breitbart into the alt-right outlet of choice, Pollak attempted to distance the site from the movement it has nurtured on a steady diet of xenophobia, racism, sexism and anti-Semitism.Source: AlternetPerhaps if Clinton had won the electoral vote, Generation KKK would be slightly less offensive, but Trump, with his hiring of deplorables in his cabinet, is normalizing the KKK and racism in general. Trump ran a campaign of hate. He s putting together a coalition of hate. Is it any wonder that suddenly, hate is cool? We don t need to hear the views of the KKK. We know the views of the KKK. Generation KKK won t be educational, it will be obscene.Featured image via Martin/Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

For instance, Trump met with the leader of Japan and invited his daughter Ivanka to sit in.As Newsweek pointed out in a damning report on Trump s conflicts of interest, At the same time, officials with her clothing company were working on a licensing agreement with Sanei International. The largest shareholder of Sanei s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, which is wholly owned by the Japanese government Trump s company is also seeking to build hotels in Taiwan at the same time Trump broke decades of policy to make a phone call to the Taiwanese president.The Trump Organization is also building projects in the Philippines, which is why Trump is getting cozy with Rodrigo Duterte despite the fact that he is committing human rights atrocities against the Filipino people.The list goes on, but it s clear just from these few examples that Trump is going to put his business interests ahead of the best interests of the country.Thus far, Republicans have ignored Trump s major conflicts of interest and seem to have no problem with Trump using the presidency for personal gain. Senate Democrats are proposing a bill that would force Trump to divest, but the GOP will almost certainly block it. Of course, if President Obama had been the owner of a business upon winning in 2008, Republicans would have initiated round after round of investigations. They would have turned it into a huge scandal.We know this because Republicans did exactly that to another beloved Democratic president. George Takei knows it, too, so he called out Republican hypocrisy by posting about it on Twitter.Remember when Jimmy Carter sold his peanut farm to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, and the GOP investigated for 6 mos anyway?  George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) December 18, 2016Indeed, Jimmy Carter built that peanut business from scratch and it meant a lot to him but he parted with it anyway to guarantee that there would not be a conflict of interest during his presidency.What happened next was disgraceful as Republicans STILL brought in a special prosecutor and persecuted Carter for six months in a desperate effort to find a scandal. They found nothing.So this is how Republicans treat Democrats versus how they are treating Trump now, and Trump s business has done many shady things over the years that would likely get Trump impeached if a special prosecutor were to be brought in to investigate. But Republicans won t do that because they are dirty hypocrites who think the law and precedent don t apply to them.Donald Trump must be forced to divest or sell his business no matter what excuse or promise he makes. The presidency is too sacred and too important to risk tainted with conflicts of interest that are sure to become huge scandals over the next four years. Hell, Trump isn t even president yet and he is already demonstrating that he intends to use the office to pursue business deals for his company even it doing so violates or destroys American foreign policy or puts our national security in jeopardy.As Takei later wrote,The problem with conflict of interest isn t that Trump might make more money. It s that his decisions actually might be guided by that goal.  George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) December 18, 2016If Republicans allow Trump to do this, they can no longer whine if a Democrat does the same thing. In fact, Republicans should not be allowed to pursue investigations against any Democrat ever again if they let Trump flout our Constitution and decades of precedent. The presidency is not a corporate office created to make personal business deals. It s the office of the American people created to do what is in the best interests of our nation as a whole. By not selling or divesting, Trump is demonstrating that he only cares about himself.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Republicans don t care. One Republican, though, has a solution, but there are two small problems: it s not a solution at all and it s tantamount to child abuse.In an interview with MLive.com, Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI) regaled the reporter with a story of how he waited a night to take his son to the doctor, when his son had a broken arm. Somehow, Huizenga thinks that s a good thing. We weren t sure what was going on. It was in the evening, so I splinted it up and we wrapped it up, and the decision was, okay, do we go to the ER? We thought it was a sprain, but weren t sure,  Huizenga said, adding that he and his wife  took every precaution and decided to go in the next morning. When it [comes to] those type of things, do you keep your child home from school and take him the next morning to the doctor because of a cold or a flu, versus take him into the emergency room? If you don t have a cost difference, you ll make different decisions,  he said.Here s the video:Yes, that s the Republican line. People should shop for healthcare. Of course, that s possible with some procedures, but for most, it s not at all. Besides, have you ever tried to pin down actual costs for medical procedures? It s not easy. Hospitals and doctor s offices aren t exactly known for offering full disclosure when it comes to pricing. Many people in this country aren t lucky enough to live in areas where there is even competition.Beyond that, though, waiting to treat a broken arm so you can save a few bucks is child abuse and for those who don t have health insurance, there s often no option but to go to the emergency room.Featured image via video screen capture.

And they didn t do that on a lark.A diplomatic source, who wasn t authorized to speak publicly and therefore wasn t named, told ThinkProgress that the decision was political. The Trump Organization reportedly contacted the Ambassador of Kuwait and put pressure on him to move the event.

Surely an upstanding citizen such as Trump would never use his position as president to continue enriching himself. Right? Right.Har de har har.Trump s greed, along with the hotel s slow start, give him an incentive to continue being totally unethical. About a month after the hotel opened, there were many travel agents and event planners who felt the place wasn t worth the trouble it takes to plan events at fancy hotels.

The ban on racial profiling has been around since 2003, when President George W. Bush created guidelines that prevented federal agents from factoring race or ethnicity in investigations. Now, the Fraternal Order of Police is acting to reverse that ban, as its website states that racial profiling is a  statistical disparity  and that the current ban burdens  law enforcement agency to somehow prove itself innocent of engaging in the unlawful use of race in its procedures and practices.  The organization also doesn t like that the ban is meant to protect racial and ethnic minorities,  which they feel is  excluding members of other races. While the proposed lifting of the ban is absolutely ridiculous, it becomes truly scary when you consider that Trump himself has implied that he is in favor of racial profiling. It was only a few months ago, in September, when Trump said that police forces needed more leniency when it comes to investigating people based on their race. Trump said: Our local police   they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don t want to be accused of profiling.They see somebody that s suspicious, they will profile. Look what s going on: Do we really have a choice? We re trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse. Apparently, Trump is oblivious to the fact that there have been various studies proving that racial profiling is ineffective and may actually be counterproductive. Of course, the National Fraternal Order of Police has accurately identified Trump as their guy. They not only supported him during his campaign, but noted his  real commitment to law enforcement.

Entertainers and sports organizations have also punished the state.For months, the Charlotte city council refused to repeal the ordinance and stood up for the rights of LGBT people.But on Monday, the Charlotte city council betrayed the LGBT community by taking a vote they said they would not take.In exchange for a special session that merely could result in the full repeal of HB 2, the Charlotte city council voted unanimously to repeal the non-discrimination ordinance. And Governor-Elect Roy Cooper persuaded them to do so. Senate Leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore assured me that as a result of Charlotte s vote, a special session will be called for Tuesday to repeal HB 2 in full,  Cooper said.  I hope they will keep their word to me and with the help of Democrats in the legislature, HB2 will be repealed in full. Full repeal will help to bring jobs, sports and entertainment events back and will provide the opportunity for strong LGBT protections in our state. And that s complete bullshit since Republicans control the state legislature and will never allow the state of North Carolina to move into the 21st century. Also, Cooper and the city council screwed over the LGBT community for a mere assurance that there will be a special session. And even if they do, that does not guarantee that HB 2 will be repealed. In fact, they ll probably keep it just to humiliate Cooper even more than they already have when the GOP held special sessions to strip him of power before he takes office.Mayor Jennifer Roberts had the gall to claim the city council vote  should in no way be viewed as a compromise of our principles or commitment to non-discrimination. Here s video of the Charlotte city council betraying the LGBT community.And that s exactly what they did. They sold out the LGBT community by going back to the status quo, which is that businesses and public institutions can now openly discriminate against LGBT people.Cooper and the Charlotte city council have opened themselves up to being accused of playing politics and that they re the ones who hurt the state instead of the Republican legislature that passed HB 2.And they deserve the criticism.The people of Charlotte did not even get the opportunity to voice their opinion before the vote took place. It happened secretly and swiftly and human rights were sacrificed for an empty promise that Republicans will not honor. In fact, they don t have to repeal HB 2 at all.

For eight years, conservatives have called him and his family every name in the book, particularly favoring the N-word. They also vowed to sabotage his presidency from the very first day. But they have the gall to call for everyone to give Trump a chance even though they never gave Obama a chance.And the complete disrespect of our current president continued during a discussion on Fox Business, which was about Michelle Obama s interview with Oprah Winfrey expressing the feeling of hopelessness that has engulfing millions of Americans since since the results came in on Election Day.Of course, Fox host Maria Bartiromo and her right-wing guests attacked Mrs. Obama, with Morgan Ortagus literally demanding her to shut up and smile. You could really hear the disdain in her voice,  Ortagus opined.  People need to understand the American people spoke, the Electoral College voted and it s time to move on. And the American people actually decided that it was a repudiation of the past eight years of the type of presidency that Barack Obama [had] and the policies he s ensued [sic]. But the American people voted for Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes so this election was definitely not a repudiation of President Obama. It was a demonstration of Russian power to meddle in our political process. Also, President Obama has a higher approval rating than Trump.But Ortagus continued to whine. You didn t hear Laura Bush saying anything eight years ago. She was gracious, she was classy, she was warm and welcoming to the new first family. And I think that Ms. Obama needs to take a cue from Laura Bush and probably just smile and be helpful to Melania Trump. Kevin Kelly then chimed in by accusing everyone who have lost hope of being lazy moochers who rely on government for everything.Ortagus agreed and then treated Michelle Obama as if she s  the help. What really just irked me about the interview is I thought it was really inappropriate. If I were in her position, I would think she should be helping the incoming first lady, the incoming administration. It s a huge transition for the first family. Melania Trump has a young son, she had young children. Let s focus on the positive and help the new first family transition. It doesn t feel like the other side understands or really cares what the American people just voted for,  Bartiromo said.Here s the video via YouTube.Again, Donald Trump LOST the popular vote, so the American people voted AGAINST him. Furthermore, President Obama won both of his elections by far wider margins but conservatives didn t care abut how the American people voted in 2008 or in 2012. They treated the Obamas like shit, and even attacked their young children and continue to do so today. So they have no right to whine about how people are treating Donald Trump. Turnabout is fair play, and Democrats should treat Trump the same way conservatives treated Obama.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Yet it is repeatedly invoked by conservative Republicans to pass measures such as voter ID and limits on early voting.Why? Because  voter fraud  is an excuse and a smoke screen for Republican initiatives designed to cut down on the minority vote, particularly black Americans.

Now that this effort has been successful, many Republicans are doing all they can to pretend that this isn t as serious as it is, since it benefits their party and chosen American leader. However, one American hero is FURIOUS with his fellow Republicans over their response to these Russian hacks, and that is former prisoner of war and Arizona Senator John McCain.Senator McCain appeared on CNN s State of the Union on Sunday morning, and had some very strong warnings for those who refuse to take the fact that Russia hacked our elections for the threat to this great republic that it is. McCain said to host Jake Tapper: This is the sign of a possible unraveling of the world order that was established after World War II, which has made one of the most peaceful periods in the history of the world. This is serious business. If they re able to harm the electoral process, they may destroy democracy, which is based on free and fair elections. Because of the gravity of this situation, McCain is going up against his fellow Republicans and calling for a special committee to investigate the activities of the Russians and especially Vladimir Putin, and insists that it must be done in a timely and bipartisan fashion, without regard for political gains or consequences. Thus far, McCain and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham are the only ones being forceful here, as the two most powerful Republicans in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, are instead choosing to roll over for Donald Trump. However, McCain isn t letting up. He has written a letter to McConnell, signed by fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, as well as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-NY) and Democratic Senator Jack Reed (D-RI). The letter said, in part: Cyber is the rare kind of all-encompassing challenge for which the Congress s jurisdictional boundaries are an impediment to sufficient oversight and legislative action. Only a select committee that is time-limited, cross-jurisdictional, and purpose-driven can address the challenge of cyber,  the letter said.  We believe it is justified by the extraordinary scope and scale of the cyber problem. This is what bipartisan patriotism looks like. Direct threats to our democracy like what Russia has done is nothing to play with simply because it benefits one s own party. I never though I d say this, but why can t more Republicans be like John McCain and Lindsey Graham?McCain continued to Tapper: There s no doubt they were interfering and no doubt it was a cyber-attack. The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we ve been totally paralyzed. I m sure that when Vladimir Putin was told quote  cut it out  unquote, I m sure that Vladimir Putin immediately stopped all cyber-activities. The truth is, they are hacking every single day. So true. This is a threat that must be met head on, and with as much force as possible, party politics be damned.

Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, in a Dec. 9 letter that up to 12 of the 47 providers in the state s Early Childhood Intervention program could stop offering services because of financial uncertainty. Texas health officials originally told the federal government about the number of providers at risk on Dec. 2, according to the letter, which was obtained by The Texas Tribune on Thursday.Texas Republicans slashed the Medicaid funding last year but the cuts were blocked by a lawsuit that has been dismissed, paving the way for the cuts to take effect now as the Christmas season goes into full swing. And because of the cuts, thousands of children could be denied healthcare because many childcare groups could be forced to shutter their programs that are covered by Medicaid. If these groups do pull out of the program, it will be devastating for kids with autism, speech delays, Down syndrome, and other disabilities and delays,  child advocate Stephanie Rubin said.  We know that these groups want to keep serving children and we know staff at [the Texas Health and Human Services Commission] is working hard on this, but the Legislature needs to make sure the funding is in place. The lack of compassion for children after they are born is right out of the Texas Republican playbook. They crusade to ban abortion but don t give a damn about the child once it is out of the womb.What s truly hypocritical is that Sarah Palin isn t in Texas giving Republicans a public thrashing. After all, she s often bragging about being an advocate for children with disabilities, especially kids with Down Syndrome because her youngest son struggles with the disability every day.So far, Palin has not uttered a word in opposition to the Medicaid cuts that would affect disabled children the most. But she was more than happy to raise hell over a coffee mug Walmart was selling online that said  got retard?  on them.Instead of focusing her efforts on a cup, perhaps Sarah Palin could go to Texas and take her own party to task for doing something truly despicable to children with healthcare needs. Because while bitching about a cup won t do much to help disabled kids, crusading for their right to get the healthcare they need and deserve would actually help tremendously.Featured Image: Aaron P.

He ll be the new Hugo Chavez. He ll do away with the two-term limit and win the 2016 election with 90 percent of the vote. We have less than six months to make sure this doesn t happen. Before Lyndon Johnson intervened to make sure blacks would become dependent on the government for just about everything they needed to live, black participation in the labor market was equal to or greater than that of whites. Today the  official  African-American unemployment rate which doesn t take into account the enormous number of blacks who aren t even trying to find jobs is around 14 percent. In fact, when you count those who don t even try to find a job, it s nearly 50 percent. When the numbers are added up, under this administration more than 60 percent of young black people are no longer even part of the labor force. It s the lowest ever recorded in our history.

He shares Trump s hatred for People of Color, and despite being Jewish, Savage supports Israel but has a complicated relationship with Jewish people. It s no wonder, then, that Savage experienced some existential angst when Trump was seen cozying up to Kanye West, who Savage called a  psycho rapper.  Then, a caller had this so say: I think as badly of it as I think of a lot of the things he s doing,  the caller said, referring to Obama.  Talking about, you know, Obama and how he agrees with Obama on so many things. When he was running for president, he didn t agree with Obama on nothing; neither did I, neither did you, neither did any of the people voting for him, and now he talks about how he has great respect for him and he s calling him for his opinion   and to invite this rapper up to Trump Tower  had he told us he was gonna do these things, do you think this movement would have been as big as it was? I don t think so. Savage agreed with the caller, and said,  I don t think you re alone.  He then complained about Trump s appointments of establishment Republicans (no complaints about billionaires, though) and the fact that Trump is no longer talking about building a wall. I m waking up and it seems to be a nightmare,  Savage said.

In this case, he actually got a secret briefing from one of Israel s spy chiefs, Yossi Cohen, Director of the Mossad. The Mossad is Israel s top intelligence agency, analogous to the CIA in many ways, and none other than Benjamin Netanyahu organized this secret meeting with Trump and his people.As if that wasn t suspicious enough, the meeting included discussions of the Iran nuclear deal, which Israel claims is a clear and present threat to its existence; along with discussions of Syria s civil war and terrorism.This is all stuff he could and should be getting from our own intelligence officials, but he s alienated our intelligence community twice now   first by shunning briefings, and second by insulting the CIA after they said they were confident that Russia hacked our election to help Trump win.It s quite clear that he looks upon our intelligence community with severe disdain. That s problematic, because if he s planning on getting a lot of intelligence this way, then it s also clear that he doesn t realize these foreign envoys don t have our best interests at heart. They have their own, and they will take advantage of him this way if they can.When it comes to the Russian hacking scandal, Trump is getting most of his intel from military generals who probably don t have the complex knowledge of digital espionage that Trump needs to be able to put a solid cybersecurity plan forward. So it wouldn t be surprising to find that he s getting more intelligence briefings from more sources, like this secret one from the Mossad.(What s worse is wondering what role Trump s ego played here. It wouldn t be surprising to find out that Trump took that meeting more because it made him feel special, and less because it was something he truly believes in.)For reference, the Mossad secretly helped supply Iran with weapons in their war against Iraq as part of the Iran-Contra Affair that embroiled President Reagan s administration in a deep scandal. Now they re reaching out to our president-elect not just for help with Iran and Syria, but also for help with Palestine. As Netanyahu has said in the past, Israel must occupy all the land for the foreseeable future. They see this as essential to their security (it s actually essential to their expansion, but they d never say that).Israel also wants Trump to stand against Obama on a U.N. resolution that Israel and its supporters see as advocating pro-Palestinian rights.The horror.It s just terrible when someone wants equal rights   a  problem  with which we here in the U.S. have some experience. And Obama is expected to speak out in support of this resolution and of restarting peace talks between Israel and Palestine.Trump has tapped his own bankruptcy lawyer, David Friedman, as the U.S. ambassador to Israel. Friedman a hardliner who doesn t believe in a two-state solution and wants to declare Israel s settlements in the West Bank legal. No wonder Israel sent a secret envoy to meet with Trump.Regardless, Trump needs to get his intelligence briefings on these subjects from U.S. intelligence officials, because he needs to see these things from our point of view. Israel isn t thinking about us, they re thinking about themselves, and could seriously undermine any efforts we re making in the Middle East. This meeting was for them, not for us.

Trump has also mentioned withdrawing United States support of NATO.The choice of Tillerson has made all of those concerns even more heightened.Tillerson worked with the Russia government for years as Exxon CEO and is even good buddies with Putin, who awards Tillerson the Russia Order of Friendship just three years ago.It s pretty clear that Tillerson will be in Putin s pocket just like Trump and that is concerning to lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle.Now we are learning that Tillerson has even deeper ties to Russia, and it should automatically disqualify him from being Secretary of State.According to documents shared by the Center for Public Integrity, Tillerson is the director of an offshore Russian subsidiary oil company known as Exxon Neftegas, details that Trump and Tillerson conveniently failed to tell the public.Tillerson was appointed in 1998 as a director of Exxon Neftegas, an ExxonMobil subsidiary involved in oil and gas operations in Russia, according to leaked documents from the Bahamas corporate registry received by the German newspaper S ddeutsche Zeitung and shared with ICIJ.Tillerson was named president of Exxon Neftegas in the same year, but his position on the board of the Bahamas-based company has not been previously reported. The Bahamas  corporate tax rate is zero and it is known for financial secrecy, dubbed by The Economist this year as  the holdout  even among island havens for its reluctance to share tax data.So Tillerson has a major conflict of interest and it should concern every American. State Department policy can affect the stock value of oil companies, especially one as deeply tied to Russia as Exxon, of which Tillerson is a major holder.Donald trump may believe Tillerson is qualified to be Secretary of State, but his closeness to Putin and his various business deals with Russia and his direct involvement in the Russia oil industry make it clear that he should not be allowed to serve as America s top diplomat, especially at a time when Russia is looking to be more of a threat to our European allies. Our next Secretary of State needs to be working for us, not the Russians.Featured Image: Getty Images/Alexey Druzhinin""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This is baffling to anybody with a functioning brain stem,  Jones began.  We have to be honest about this. Indeed, the CIA and 17 intelligence agencies along with the FBI all agree that Russia launched a cyber attack against our political institutions with one of the goals being to help Trump beat Hillary Clinton.Now Vladimir Putin will have a puppet in the White House for the next four years who refuses to condemn Russia because it would acknowledge that he is illegitimate. Yes, other presidents have tried to say nice things about the Russians,  Jones continued.  Not in the face of an active attack on the country! It s true. Past presidents have made attempts to be friendly toward Russia, but Trump is doing so after our intelligence community just concluded that Russia committed espionage, which is an act of war, against our country. But Trump is defending Russia instead. Cyber war is real war,  Jones explained.  So you have an active attack on our country and you have the president-elect who cannot find in himself to say this is wrong and it needs to stop. Jones pointed out that Trump has responded personally and as a partisan to attacks, but has demonstrated an unwillingness to respond as a patriot to an attack on our nation s sacred election infrastructure. This is an attack on our country!  Jones said in conclusion.  And I just think that everybody sitting here trying to pretend this is normal, this is not normal and it s dangerous. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump recently demanded that China return a United States Navy drone they seized in the South China Sea.

If said family is that of the elected President or Vice-President, that protection becomes the expense of the American taxpayers   no matter where those people are. In the case of Donald Trump becoming president-elect, that means that New York City is now paying astronomical amounts of money to protect the Trump family. This is especially expensive, seeing as how the Trumps, prior to The Donald running for   and eventually winning   the presidential election, lived in a golden glass tower in the middle of New York City s Fifth Avenue, which is one of the busiest streets in the world.Well, one person is sick of Trump being able to milk the taxpayers of New York City   a city that in no way voted for him   for huge amounts of money and even more inconvenience to protect him and his family and their staff in the Fifth Avenue version of a palace in America. New York City Police Department Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence, John Miller, is sick of the Trumps bleeding a city that can t stand the guy and his family and didn t want them in the White House to begin with, and he doesn t want the people of New York City footing the bill on this one. Miller says of the chaos and money Trump is causing the city: We went down to Washington and we described those costs to our congressional delegation from New York. They got it immediately. But Congress has failed to pass a budget again. And to get funding for this, they had a continuing resolution. We asked them to add $35 million to reimburse New York City for [Trump s security]. They came up with a figure of $7 million, which covers a piece of the overtime but not the rest of it. Miller continued on, saying that New York City is  obviously disappointed,  with the idea of protecting Trump via taxpayer dollars in a city that clearly despises the man. Miller continued: We really won t be able to gauge the long-term costs, John, until we know: Is he coming home every weekend?

We feel the difference now,  she said.  See, now, we are feeling what not having hope feels like. Hope is necessary. It s a necessary concept and Barack didn t just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes. Indeed, the only ones who didn t feel hope in 2008 were conservatives who vowed from day one to sabotage President Obama at every turn, hurling racism and hate every step of the way for the last eight years. But even more Americans are going to sorely miss him and the optimism he brought to the office. Donald Trump, however, is no Barack Obama. As Trump continues to hire people who hate the department they have been picked to head and picks fights with foreign nations and is poised to dismantle every program that made this country great already, millions of Americans are horrified and living in fear of what this nation is about to become.Of course, Pirro had a problem with Michelle Obama telling the truth, so she lashed out at her for five minutes by blaming her for everything from beheadings in the Middle East to protests against police.Basically, Pirro bitched about Michelle Obama in every little way and acted like a petulant child. To try and convince America that once you and Barack exit the White House, hope is removed for America is an outrage,  Pirro whined.  But I get it, for you hope is gone. You and your family and friends won t be able to fly to another 46 countries, with security and hair and make-up in tow. Michelle, you may not realize it, but Americans  rejected you and everything you stand for. Hope is when people   30,000 at a time   stand in line in the cold with their children hoping to get a glimpse of a man they think can change the course of their lives from the downward spiral that you and  Mister Hope and Change  have put them on. Here s the video via YouTube.Of course, Americans did not  reject  the Obamas in this election at all. In fact, Obama s approval rating is higher than Trump s and millions would have preferred voting for him a third time. Also, Russia helped Trump steal the election and Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes. Most Americans also fear a Trump presidency. Someone should explain to Pirro that fear is the opposite of hope.As someone who claims to support women s rights, one would think Pirro would also be concerned about Trump being in the White House considering the way he has treated women over the years. Pirro is also pro-choice, which goes against Republicans who currently aim to eliminate Roe v. Wade in the next four years. So women across the country have every reason and right to be losing hope since their freedom could be seriously restricted. But apparently, Pirro forgot about women and the plight they are about to face.Once again, Pirro is demonstrating that she s a racist bitch who hates successful women for speaking their minds and telling the truth.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It is assumed that Trump s team wanted the names so they could fire anyone who supports what science already tells us: that climate change is real and humans have contributed to it.Well, the Energy Department told Trump to go f*ck themselves.But now the hate group known as the Family Research Council is calling on Trump to persecute gay employees and any employee who supports LGBT rights within the State Department.In a letter to Trump s team, Tony Perkins whines about how President Obama and Hillary Clinton protected the LGBT community from anti-gay bigots who want to strip them of their human rights.He then complained about how America is offending some nations by hiring gay people. You know, because the Family Research Council is a fan of how Russia persecutes gay people. To carry out this extreme agenda, the Obama administration has systematically filled the ranks of State with LGBTQ and abortion activists,  Perkins wrote before calling for Trump and his team to conduct a witch hunt.  Unless the next secretary of state is willing to resist and remove this embedded agenda, the promotion and protection of true human rights, like religious liberty, will continue to languish. That s right, Perkins wants Trump to be like Joe McCarthy and he doubled down by literally demanding that LGBT people and those who support LGBT rights be  ferreted out  and replaced by anti-gay bigots.It s for this reason that I have raised concerns about the nomination of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. I certainly don t see Tillerson cut from the same cloth as Clinton or Kerry, but he doesn t have to be for these anti-life, liberal social policies to continue. He must have the courage to stop the promotion of this anti-family, anti-life agenda, which is very much a question mark given that he capitulated to activists pushing to liberalize the Boy Scouts  policy on homosexuality when he was at the helm of the organization.The incoming administration needs to make clear that these liberal policies will be reversed and the  activists  within the State Department promoting them will be ferreted out and will be replaced by conservatives who will ensure the State Department focuses on true international human rights like religious liberty which is under unprecedented assault.But Donald Trump was in no mood for Perkins  hate and sent a strong message delivered by Trump spokesman Jason Miller that discrimination will not be tolerated. President-elect Trump campaigned on a message of unity in order to bring all Americans together. To think that discrimination of any kind will be condoned or tolerated in a Trump Administration is simply absurd. In other words, Perkins can go f*ck himself.Now, this doesn t mean that we should trust that Trump will keep to his word. After all, he has repeatedly flip-flopped through his campaign and ever since the election. But it should be noted that Trump sent a similar message to anti-bigots last month. After being asked about marriage equality, Trump told 60 Minutes that same-sex marriage has been settled by the courts and that he s  fine with that. So for now, at least Trump is being consistent when it comes to LGBT right. Conservatives must be furious.Featured Image: Sara D.

Economist Robert Reich sees a serious problem here as anyone should and said on his Facebook page: Is anyone else uneasy about Trump s daughter and son-in-law becoming White House advisors to President Trump? It s not just their extensive Trump business holdings and conflicts of interest that worry me. It s also their family ties.We ve elected a president, not a king.A president hires advisors. A king bestows privileges and titles on his family.A president wants advice from experts who will tell him what s in America s best interest. A king wants advice from people who will tell him what s in his own personal best interest.A president assembles a White House staff. A king assembles a court.A president dismisses advisors who don t perform. A king doesn t get rid of family members, except when he cuts off their heads. And that s it, in a nutshell. That s the difference between the elected president of a democracy, and a man who would crown himself king like Cheetolini seems to want to do.What has the dark side of America done in electing this autocratic demagogue? Trump supporters are brainwashed; that much is clear. There are so many conflicts of interest with Trump as president that it s insane. Now, those conflicts involve him giving his daughter and son-in-law jobs like a king bestowing lands and titles on his family.

She recently said that the law has exceptions that can open up a  realm of possibilities.  She then tried to assure us that  there will be complete distinction and separation,  without any ambiguity.Sure. Right. And Trump canceled the press conference where he was supposed to explain when and how he was divesting from his businesses because reasons.People whined up one side and down the other about the Bush dynasty and the Clinton dynasty during the election.

Trump s ensuring that his family has the ties they need to to take over after he s gone (whether he s gone via election or death).Reich is right.

In the letter published by the Huffington Post, the professors stated that they had  grave concern  about Trump s erratic behavior.

Professional standards do not permit us to venture a diagnosis for a public figure whom we have not evaluated personally.His widely reported symptoms of mental instability   including grandiosity, impulsivity, hypersensitivity to slights or criticism, and an apparent inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality   lead us to question his fitness for the immense responsibilities of the office.

But now, he s bringing Dick Cheney on board to help ensure that Rex Tillerson is confirmed next year as Trump s secretary of state.Some Republicans have made it clear they have reservations about Tillerson s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. So, Cheney is now Trump s surrogate in order to serve as a bridge between the Trump team and skeptical Republicans. Cheney is a former oil executive and longtime friend of Tillerson s, according to Politico.It s a scenario no one could have possibly foreseen: that one of the key architects of the Iraq War, which Trump slammed on the campaign trail, is now being enlisted as an emissary for a man Trump wants to help steer his ship of state.Wrong, Politico. At the present time, nothing is surprising anymore after Trump s election.Another transition aide said Cheney s imprimatur may serve as  a good housekeeping seal of approval  with Republican skeptics. And indeed, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio received a call from the former vice president earlier this week. The goal:  To move Marco the right way,  according to a source familiar with the conversation. Rubio will cast a pivotal vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve the nomination before it proceeds to the full Senate.Cheney is also in close contact with senior Trump aides and speaks frequently with Mike Pence who has said he hopes to model his vice presidency on Cheney s.

Even the FBI agrees with the CIA. But Republicans don t care because Russia helped their candidate win. If Russia had helped Hillary Clinton win, you can bet that Republicans would be screaming bloody murder and threatening impeachment along with endless investigations because they are total hypocrites when it comes down to it.During his final press conference of 2016, President Obama shamed Republicans for abandoning American values by approving of what Russia did and favoring Vladimir Putin, who will now have a puppet in the White House after January 20th unless the Electoral College rejects Trump on December 19th. Unless the American people genuinely think that the professionals in the CIA, the FBI, our entire intelligence infrastructure, many of whom, by the way, served in previous administrations and are Republicans, are less trustworthy than the Russians, then people should pay attention to what our intelligence agencies say,  Obama said. They can impact us if we lose track of who we are,  Obama continued about Russia.  They can impact us if we abandon our values. President Obama explained that Putin can weaken us if we  buy into notions that it s okay to intimidate the press  or persecute political opponents or discriminate against others. Obama then slammed Republicans for being so anti-Democrat that they ve started to view Russia and Putin favorably.And then he invoked Ronald Reagan to demonstrate just how shameful Republicans are acting today. There was a survey some of you saw where   now this is just one poll, but a pretty credible source   37% of Republican voters approve of Putin. Over a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB. Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave. And how did this happen? It happened in part because for too long everything that happens in this town, everything that s said is seen through the lens of does this help or hurt us relative to Democrats or relative to President Obama. Obama concluded by predicting that we will continue to be  vulnerable to foreign influence  unless Republicans change.Here s the video via YouTube.Rather than admit that Trump is an illegitimate president-elect, Republicans would rather defend Russia so they can have power. That s really what this is about. They are absolutely okay with Russia meddling in our elections as long as they are the ones who benefit from it. That undermines our democracy and damages the integrity of our elections. It also opens the door for foreign entities to meddle in our elections on behalf of both parties, because if Republicans are allowed to get away with winning an election with support from Russia, what stops Democrats from getting help in 2020 from China or a different nation? The answer is nothing, because if Republicans whine about it they ll be nothing more than hypocrites.If the election results are allowed to stand and Trump is allowed to take office, the American people will have surrendered our political process to foreign powers. We will no longer control our own destiny and will instead be driven by propaganda from our enemies. That may be okay with Republicans, but the American people as a whole should be outraged and should demand a new election immediately.Featured image via Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Current law gives Democrats the majority because Cooper is going to be governor, and the governor is able to make the majority of the appointments to the board. McCrory had this power himself, but he signed SB 4 to strip it away from Cooper.Furthermore, Republicans also passed House Bill 17 requiring state Senate approval for Cooper s cabinet picks, which means the state of North Carolina will likely be denied leadership in various state agencies because Republicans will more than likely refuse to approve of anyone Cooper picks. McCrory has yet to make a decision about that piece of legislation.Republicans also gave McCrory the power to appoint a member of the Industrial Commission to a six-year term instead of his appointment only being allowed to fill the remaining term of a commissioner who resigned due to health issues. And he picked the wife of his chief-of-staff to fill the seat. The commission hears appeals of worker compensation cases, so McCrory s pick serves as a  f*ck you  to workers across the state.Furthermore, another bill would slash Cooper s staff from 1,500 employees to 300, a move that would cripple the governor s office.Protesters stormed the statehouse over the last two days to voice opposition to the power grab, which is basically a coup. But as usual, Republicans ignored the protests and passed the bills anyway because they are petty losers. You can bet that had McCrory won the race Republicans would not be passing or even proposing any of these bills. They are only doing it to sabotage Cooper.These petty moves by Republicans are unconstitutional and should be declared null and void by the courts. The people of North Carolina should be enraged by what has happened here, and if these new laws are allowed to stand Republicans had better prepare themselves for the retribution that will occur when Democrats retake the legislature.

However, a new report regarding how his son-in-law Jared Kushner tried to manipulate the press into covering the Trump campaign in a better light is downright disturbing. According to The Hill, Kushner offered better access to the campaign in exchange for more pro-Trump news pieces.The first attempt to control messaging in this way was done by asking Sinclair Broadcasting   an outfit that owns local stations nationwide   to have anchors refrain from commenting on Trump s rallies, statements, and interviews, and just air footage of the rallies and interviews instead, and in the most flattering light possible. Kushner revealed this tactic while speaking to New York City business people. The trade off was that the Trump team would be more cooperative with friendly networks.In fairness, it seems that Sinclair Broadcasting s efforts here were noble, and likely if it were anyone but the highly manipulative Team Trump, it would likely be fine because no other campaign would ever make such demands. Sinclair Vice President Scott Livingston said of the deal: Our promise was to give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position share their position with our viewers. Certainly we presented an opportunity so that Mr. Trump could clearly state his position on the key issues. Our commitment to our viewers is to go beyond podium, beyond the rhetoric. We re all about tracking the truth and telling the truth and that s typically missing in most political coverage. Okay, fair enough, but it seems Livingston underestimated Trump and his campaign. They have no respect for journalists, do not tolerate voices that are critical of Trump, and they refuse to cooperate with media outlets that are not explicitly pro-Trump. This attitude is never more apparent than what happened when Trump s team tried to get CNN to have more Trump supporters included in their famously heated political panel debates. This was a request from Jared Kushner as well, and when CNN s Jeff Zucker shot that request down, the Trump people became increasingly difficult for the network to deal with.CNN s refusal to kowtow to his request seemed to irritate Kushner so much that he couldn t stop talking about the network at the New York business meeting. One person who was in the room said of Kushner s CNN remarks: He kept going on and on about it. It was around this time when Trump started calling CNN the  Clinton News Network  and trashing them on Twitter.This does not bode well for the free press and the First Amendment in general under a Trump Administration. Clearly, these people want to control the message   and that message better be pro-Trump or else. Likely, Breitbart will be a Trump propaganda arm, and he will, slowly but surely, sow distrust in any press that is not explicitly flattering and supportive of him. He already has a head start, as most of his supporters do not trust anything that isn t said by Trump himself.Welcome to your Banana Republic, America.

Kudlow isn t just an advocate of the failed trickle-down theory of economics, he also claimed, back in 2007, that no recession was coming. As we all know, 2008 proved him dead wrong, and now Trump wants him in a top economic position.According to Craig Harrington, Director of the Economic Policy Program at Media Matters for America, this is how bad Kudlow is: According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), an award-winning nonprofit research organization that is perhaps best-known for determining a chronology of American business cycles and recessions, the Great Recession began in December 2007. Yet Kudlow published blogs on December 5, 6, and 7 of that year titled  The Recession Debate Is Over,   There Ain t No Recession,  and  Bush Boom Continues,  in the conservative National Review. By July 2008, as the unemployment rate continued to balloon in the seventh month of recession, Kudlow was still arguing in National Review that there was no recession or housing crisis. In  The Recession Debate Is Over, Kudlow claimed that the jobs numbers and business profits added up to no recession at all. In  There Ain t No Recession,  he doubled down on all of that, and in  Bush Boom Continues,  he actually said:That last one was published on Dec. 7, 2007. Eight months earlier, we began to see serious signs of an economic crahs with New Century Financial Corp., a major subprime lender, filing for bankruptcy. Unemployment began rising in Dec. 2007, and the Fed lowered short-term interest rates for the fifth time in four months.Kudlow didn t see any of that. He was focused entirely on the November jobs reports and business profits. He totally ignored other economic indicators. He s almost as bad as those who look only at the stock market for an idea of how our economy is doing.Moving on from Kudlow s absurdly incorrect predictions, in Feb. 2008, President Bush signed the first economic stimulus package into law, and then in March, the financial industry began crashing with the collapse of Bear Stearns. In April 2008, the Fed reduced interest rates yet again, and then in September, Lehmann Brothers collapsed.We all remember the chaos of the rest of 2008.This is more than simply putting someone who will work hard to make the rich richer and the poor poorer into an economic advisory position. This is someone whose economic experience and ideas are so far off that he couldn t, or wouldn t, see a recession coming despite the housing bubble collapse beginning in late 2006.Most economists worth their salt could see that foreshadowed the Great Recession, and knew that the Great Recession began at the end of 2007 (although Trump was  excited  for the housing crash because it meant more money for him).However, what can we expect from a president-elect who seems to see the presidency as just another reality show? Kudlow has published no scholarly papers on economics, and has no degree in economics at all, so he s not exactly qualified for the top economic position in our government.He plays an economist on television, though, and that s enough for Trump. Many of his cabinet picks seem to say that he has to know people from television in order to consider them for his cabinet. Kudlow is just another possibility that shows Trump has no idea what he s doing and thinks this is just another reality show.Featured image by Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 2.0 via Flickr ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Trump himself even encouraged the Russians to keep committing espionage against this country so that he could benefit from it.Now he s trying to deflect by tweeting about how Russia hacked the DNC and discovered that Hillary Clinton supposedly received debate questions in advance. Of course, Trump conveniently ignores the fact that he got questions in advance, too.Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2016You see, Trump wants the public to focus on Hillary Clinton again instead of the fact that Russia helped him win.

According to TMZ, the one-time child actor, now a huge Trump supporter, says Nancy Mack attacked him at an elementary school function over his support for the president-elect.The alleged incident happened on December 10 but TMZ reported it on December 15.Consequence of Sound reports:Baio told law enforcement that the incident occurred at a school event on Saturday in Thousand Oaks, California when Mack, who is staunchly anti-Trump, began  berating and cursing  him over his support of a man who said  Grab  em by the pussy. Baio said that Mack asked the washed up actor how he could support a man who said,  Grab  em by the pussy.  According to Baio, she repeatedly kept saying,  Grab  em by the pussy  even though he had asked her to stop. Baio told police officers that Mack then attacked him by grabbing underneath his arms and shaking and pushing him.However, Mack said she was merely demonstrating how Donald Trump hugs women, rather than assaulting Baio, according to sources close to the drummer s wife.TMZ further states that the Ventura County Sheriff s Dept. is investigating the incident and Mack is listed as a battery suspect.In one tweet, Renee Baio, Chachi s wife, said that her husband wasn t  hugged  but was  grabbed  by Mack.She also says she s being attacked on social media.  I m not sure why me, my husband or child is getting bashed. Scott & BB were the victims. I was a witness. Hard to stand back & do nothing,  she tweeted. Well, her husband is probably being bashed because he s a moron. At one point during the presidential campaign cycle, Baio threatened to sue anyone who called him a moron, so naturally, everyone started calling him a moron. Baio ended up blocking half of Twitter after that. There s also that time he circulated a meme calling Hillary Clinton a  c*nt.  He also thinks President Obama, who identifies as a Christian, is really a Muslim.

In addition, many were fairly certain that Russia had direct involvement in our election. And now, as it turns out, both things definitely did affect the election, and the first person who will agree with that definitely seems to be Hillary Clinton herself.Breaking her silence while speaking to donors about what seemed to directly impact the election away from her winning, Clinton didn t hold back and called out Russian President Vladimir Putin by name.According to NBC News: Hillary Clinton told donors on Thursday night that her loss was partly due to U.S. election hacks directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and FBI director James Comey s election-eve letter to Congress related to her use of a private email server. Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this Election,  Clinton is heard saying in an audio recording first obtained by the New York Times and verified as authentic by several sources present at the event to NBC News. Clinton also said: He is determined not only to score a point against me, which he did, but also to undermine our democracy. And as it turns out, Putin was directly involved with the hacks and how the information gained was to be used. In fact, NBC News reported: Putin s objectives were multifaceted, a high-level intelligence source told NBC News. What began as a  vendetta  against Hillary Clinton morphed into an effort to show corruption in American politics and to  split off key American allies by creating the image that [other countries] couldn t depend on the U.S. to be a credible global leader anymore,  the official said. Putin very clearly wanted Donald Trump to win and used information gained to release only what he wanted to skilfully get what he wanted out the the U.S. election.And now that all of this has been revealed, President Obama is vowing retaliation against Russia, saying: I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will at a time and place of our own choosing some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be. And while Donald Trump and his campaign are clearly pleased with the election results and want to peacefully continue a transition while thinking all accusations against Russia are just excuses for a Clinton loss, evidence proves quite to the contrary.Hopefully, we will get to the bottom of this and justice will prevail.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will,  President Obama said.  At a time and place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be.

Anderson Cooper pointed out the President Obama only has one month left in office but Van Jones explained that he s still the president. He went on to explain that Russia is a direct threat to our European allies and that we created NATO for that very reason.Of course, Kayleigh McEnany whined and claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton have worked with Russia in the past and demanded to know why they did so if Russia is such a threat.That s when Van Jones crushed McEnany into silence. There was a time when the bigger threat was from Iran and the concern that Iran was going to get nuclear weapons,  Jones replied.  So Hillary Clinton, in her brilliance, was able to pull together both the Chinese, not our friends every day, and the Russians, not our friends any day, in an alliance to deal with Iran. You have to pick. You have to have sequences. And then Jones delivered the knockout blow by comparing how President Obama and Hillary Clinton have worked with Russia to how Donald Trump has invited Russia to attack us. At no point do I believe that we said,  Well, geez, we re going to now say that you can attack our country. At no point did the United States tell Russia,  you can hack our infrastructure, you can mess with our elections, and that s okay, too. McEnany could only sit in silence knowing that she got schooled.Here s the video via YouTube:Obama and Clinton worked with Russia when it was necessary and beneficial to both nations and the world. But when it came down to it, both were tough on Russia on issues of human rights and Russian aggression towards Europe, which is why sanctions were slapped against Russia after they invaded Ukraine and seized the Crimea. Donald Trump not only asked Russia to keep hacking our infrastructure, he intends to drop the sanctions against them as a reward for helping him get elected and has expressed his intention to weaken NATO, which would just invite further Russian aggression without challenge from the United States.Donald Trump is a threat to national security and world peace and once President Obama leaves office people who foolishly voted for Trump are going to wish they had him back.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

While it seems likely that Trump inexplicably will get away with his role, Putin and Russia may not get off so easy if President Obama has anything to say about it. I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will at a time and place of our own choosing,  Obama told NPR on Thursday, adding that   some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be. The President (the last legitimate one if Trump has anything to say about it) did not go into more detail, but he seems to be ready to take action before he leaves office on January 20. Obama s options vary, ranging from sanctions to giving Russia a taste of their own medicine with a star-spangled cyber attack of their own. There are still a whole range of assessments taking place among the agencies. And so when I receive a final report, you know, we ll be able to, I think, give us a comprehensive and best guess as to those motivations,  Obama told NPR.  But that does not in any way, I think, detract from the basic point that everyone during the election perceived accurately   that in fact what the Russian hack had done was create more problems for the Clinton campaign than it had for the Trump campaign. Obama says that he has directly confronted Putin about the attack. Mr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this, because I spoke to him directly about it,  he told NPR. Officials confirm that the President made Putin well aware of the many, many possible U.S. responses.An increase in sanctions or a cyberattack against Russia could be very, very big (potentially crippling, if done right) and incredibly uncomfortable for both Putin and his friend Trump.But here s the kicker   even though the White House acknowledges that The Donald  obviously  was aware of and eager to take advantage of the hacks, unless something is done to stop Trump from assuming office any action we take is for naught. Trump, who once tweeted that he hopes Putin will be his  new best friend, will be in a position to undo any sanctions or to stop any other U.S. reaction on day one.At this point, we as a nation need to turn to our electors whose one job at the moment is to ensure that a tyrant installed by a foreign power does not take office.

He s a liar, he s a hypocrite, he s an autocrat, he s a narcissist. And he promises to continue talking out of both sides of his mouth the same as he did on the campaign trail.And his audiences will continue to eat up every syllable. Why on earth do they do that? Matt Bai, a political columnist at Yahoo! News, boils it down to this one sentence: Trump is a pure opportunist, a pitch-perfect crooner of whatever note resonates.  [emphasis mine]BOOM! There it is, right there. Trump knows exactly what will make people respond favorably to him and he says it. In doing so, he renders anything he said before irrelevant, no matter how contradictory. Look at all his cabinet picks that followed his promise of  draining the swamp  of Washington insiders, elites and cronies. His cabinet is Wall Street bankers. It s establishment politicians. It s members of the very same military leadership he called stupid during his campaign.Trump embodies a type of leader known as the  charismatic leader,  and that s not necessarily a good thing. True, not all charismatic leaders are bad, but they aren t all good either. In Trump s case, this is a very bad thing. In Management Today, columnist Adam Gale says the world that Trump comes from is one where  force of personality is more important than collaboration or cold reasoning. That s all that matters, and why we re suddenly living in a post-fact world. Facts, truths, and reason don t matter if Trump can convince people they don t matter. And he himself admitted to playing his audiences like the violins they re not in The Art of the Deal: I play to people s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That s why a little hyperbole never hurts.  [emphasis mine]Think he won t do that as President? Think again   he s already done it. His loyal subjects still bleat about how amazing he is to have struck a deal with Carrier to keep jobs here in the U.S. They completely ignore the facts that Carrier is still sending jobs to Mexico and is planning to raise prices. They don t seem to care that they re going to automate their Indiana plant, which will destroy some of those jobs Trump supposedly saved so they can keep their costs down. Their parent company s CEO, Greg Hayes, said that outright: We re going to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive. Is it as cheap as moving to Mexico with lower cost labor? No. But we will make that plant competitive just because we ll make the capital investments there. But what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs. In the case of the Carrier deal, Trumpkins  specific fantasy is the idea that Trump can coerce, cajole, and even strongarm companies, one by one, into not only keep jobs here, but also into at least maintaining their current workforce, or adding more jobs. The fantasy is that Trump is going to be able to erase every individual s personal economic distress.That s impossible, but that s what they see through their rose-colored glasses. There are other fantasies, too, like this: My whole life I ve been greedy, greedy, greedy. I ve grabbed all the money I could get. I m so greedy. But now I d like to be greedy for the United States. Washington Post columnist and The Nation publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel hit the nail of that Trumpkin fantasy on the head with this: It was a compelling story: the rapacious mogul turned Robin Hood, setting out to reform the rigged system that made him rich in the name of the common good. She went on to describe how that s an illusion that Trump has created for his faithful subjects, but which his actual policy positions during his campaign should have shattered.This is how Trump s followers can keep right on crowing about Trump s awesomeness and how he s the president we need to be great again. One could even say that they re brainwashed in a very real way (they also seem to be too stupid to see how stupid they are, but that s a different subject).Oh sure, there are a few who are angry. There are a few who have woken up. Former Congressman Joe Walsh, of Illinois, is one such person (and agreeing with that man on anything at all makes us feel like we re in a bizarre alternate reality where night is day, hell is cold, and dragons really do exist, but, well, there it is).Sarah Palin called out his deal with Carrier as crony capitalism.But so many others? They re on social media being as trashy as ever toward the press, toward Democrats, toward anyone who doesn t march exactly to Trump s drumbeat. They re calling any news that doesn t reinforce the golden crown they see on Cheetolini s head  fake news,  and completely ignoring how many campaign promises Trump has already broken. They trust him implicitly because he knows exactly how to sing their tune in perfect time and pitch. Whether he means it is irrelevant.And he ll keep right on playing them. Bai said he ll do it until someone can prove to him that there s a real cost. Bai is right.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But the Constitution says that officeholders in the United States government may not receive presents, emoluments, or titles from foreign states.Article I, section 9 states,No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.And since Trump s business receives money from foreign nations, he would be violating the Constitution on the first day of his administration. And it s even worse when one considers that Trump s businesses have ties to businesses backed by foreign governments such as in the Philippines, and that foreign governments could blackmail Trump by threatening his profits or his foreign business partners. Trump could also use the presidency to extract business deals from nations in exchange for American support or aid, even if helping certain nations goes against the best interests of our country.In short, Trump should be forced to put his company in a blind trust or sell it altogether to avoid these problems and put these conflicts of interest to rest.That s why Senate Democrats plan to introduce a bill to do just that. Our President-elect has significantly greater risk of business and financial conflicts of interest than any other president, yet has so far refused to follow the precedent set by previous presidents. To this day, President-elect Trump has refused to address his conflicts of interest,  Senator Chris Coons said.Coons, along with Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ben Cardin, Dick Durbin, and Jeff Merkley have all endorsed the legislation and pointed out that presidents have divested their financial interests to avoid violating the Constitution for decades. If Trump is allowed to be president and keep his business decades of precedent would be wiped out, paving the way for anyone to use the presidency for personal profit. The American people deserve to know that the President of the United States is working to do what s best for the country   not using his office to do what s best for himself and his businesses,  Elizabeth Warren said.  The only way for President-elect Trump to truly eliminate conflicts of interest is to divest his financial interests and place them in a blind trust. This has been the standard for previous presidents, and our bill makes clear the continuing expectation that President-elect Trump do the same. Republicans, of course, will probably refuse to bring the bill to a vote on the Senate floor, and if they do they ll be helping Trump violate the Constitution that they claim to hold so dear.Senate Democrat s are preparing for a war and they should be. After all, Republicans have established precedent for obstructing and attacking a president over the last eight years and turnabout is fair play.

In fact, an elector in Texas reports that Trump supporters threatened to rape and murder his family if he doesn t vote the way they want him to vote.Christopher Suprun shared the grisly threat with his fellow elector Art Sisneros, who shared the threat with Texas Monthly. You vote for Trump or we rape your wife and daughters with a knife before we kill you,  the threat reads.  Do as told or face consequences. Sisneros explained that he has also been receiving threats from Trump supporters. The Trump supporters and the people on the right thought that I absolutely had to vote for Trump, and to do otherwise was some kind of treasonous act,  he said.Except that Sisneros can vote for whomever he pleases when December 19th rolled around, and that is getting easier to figure out since left-wing groups are reportedly encouraging the electors to choose anyone but Trump, even if it s not Hillary Clinton.Right-wingers and Trump supporters, on the other hand, are being downright scary and are acting like the electors are required to vote for Trump. They were far more aggressive and far more nasty,  Sisneros said.  I received a lot of threats. I just didn t think it would do any good to share them or make a big deal out of them. There were several nasty ones to vote for Trump, or else. Some of them were pretty vague like,  We re going to hunt you down,  that kind of stuff. Some were like,  We re going to find out where you work and come after you. Frankly, threats like these ought to immediately disqualify Trump from office. After all, he and his supporters are the ones threatening the electors with dire consequences. This should really make it easy for the electors to reject Trump outright. He is a danger to our democracy and his cabinet picks are a threat to our government and democratic institution. Trump is even a danger to our continued survival as a free people considering Russia interfered with our election and helped Trump win so Putin can have a puppet in the White House.The Electoral College has a chance to do what they were designed to do and that is making sure that a demagogue and con artist is prevented from holding the highest office in the land. So the electors need to have courage to save our nation.

Current law gives Democrats the majority because Cooper is going to be governor.Another bill would eliminate 80 percent of the governor s staff, from 1,500 employees to only 300, which would make Cooper s job excruciatingly difficult.Furthermore, Republicans are trying to pass a bill requiring state Senate approval for Cooper s cabinet picks, which means the state of North Carolina will likely be denied leadership in various state agencies because Republicans will more than likely refuse to approve of anyone Cooper picks.Republicans are literally trying to cripple Cooper s administration before he even takes office. But that s not all.Republicans also introduced a bill that would prevent the state Supreme Court from reviewing cases for years by requiring cases to go through the state Court of Appeals first. Democrats gained the majority on the Supreme Court in November while Republicans have the majority on the Appeals Court. So, it s pretty clear what Republicans are doing. Instead of a court-packing bill, it appears we got a court-denial bill,  Southern Coalition for Social Justice director Anita Earls told The Charlotte Observer.  This proposal seems to delay Supreme Court review of cases, including those involving citizens  constitutional rights. Unconstitutional laws could be in effect for years before the state Supreme Court would finally get the case and rule. Republicans are also trying to take cabinet positions away by turning them into independent agencies whose leaders would be appointed by the lieutenant governor, who happens to be a Republican.In short, North Carolina Republicans are screwing over the people and the state because they can t handle losing an election. They are pathetic losers who should be forced out of office before they do any more damage.North Carolina pastor William Barber is reporting that Republicans have introduced 15 bills in all targeting the power of the governor and he is organizing protests against the GOP power grab. This is extremism gone amuck,  Barber told Joy Reid on Wednesday night.  These folks are not even Republicans. They re on some other world. I mean, my great-grandfather was a Republican. They are just power hungry. Here s the video via YouTube:The people of North Carolina should be outraged by what Republicans are doing. They voted for Roy Cooper as their governor but Republicans are trying to sabotage him to prevent him from doing the job the voters elected him to do. Republicans are acting like petulant children because they lost the governor s race. If Democrats did this, they would be throwing a temper tantrum.Featured Image: Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He cannot stand to be criticized, and any publication that dares to do so risks his ire. He banned a long list of publications from his campaign rallies, and now that he has been elected, he continues to attack the Fourth Estate. Trump s latest target is Vanity Fair, and the reason could not be more petty.Apparently, one of the magazine s writers, Tina Nguyen, wrote a scathing article criticizing the quality of Trump Grill, which is an eatery in Trump Tower. Nguyen says of the place: The allure of Trump s restaurant, like the candidate, is that it seems like a cheap version of rich. Nguyen also goes on to say that Trump Grill s quality  reveals everything you need to know about our next president. Of course, one of the things that sticks in Trump s craw the most is anyone questioning his wealth, or his status among the elite. There are many people who believe that Trump is not a billionaire at all, and that if only he would release his tax returns, we d see a man who knows nothing of finances and money, who is a tax cheat, as well as a cheapskate who donates nothing to charitable causes like most truly wealthy people do.The article provoked a thinly veiled threat against Vanity Fair, as Trump insisted the magazine was in  big trouble :Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2016Of course, the mention of editor Graydon Carter is telling as well, as to Trump s ability to hold long and enduring grudges. Carter is, after all, the one who dubbed Trump the  short-fingered vulgarian,  and it is a moniker that is appropriate and has stuck. That s why the GOP primaries devolved into dirty jokes regarding hand sizes. Of course, this speaks to Trump s insecurity about his own masculinity, which is something else that Trump cannot stand to have challenged.All in all, this is part of a much deeper and more troubling pattern, though. Trump is directly attacking the First Amendment, and it does not bode well to have a president who is so hostile to the press. He has already done a remarkable job of making his supporters blindly believe that the press hates them, that they are out to get them and their chosen king. Now, Trump s direct attacks on the press and specific publications means that he will likely use the bully pulpit of the White House to do the same for the next four years.This is how autocracies start, folks. Look for Trump to try to set up some kind of state-funded propaganda network, similar to what they have in Russia, to drive the message he wants and to shut out all other voices. This will likely start in the form of Breitbart News, which will then morph into some kind of television network on behalf of the Trump Administration.These are scary times, folks. Remember   we must resist. We can no longer count on the institutions we ve long taken for granted to prevent the slow formation of a dictatorship.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Ever since Donald Trump came on the scene, famed political commentator Keith Olbermann has been on a tear with one mission and one mission only: To warn Americans of the dangers of a Trump presidency. During the campaign, Olbermann had a show on GQ s YouTube channel called  The Closer.  Now that Trump has won, his efforts are called  The Resistance. In Olbermann s latest piece, he reminds us all what Alexander Hamilton said regarding the creation of the Electoral College in the Federalist Papers. In short, Hamilton s creation was largely an effort to be a safety valve of sorts, a check on the worst impulses of the public when it comes to choosing a president. Hamilton said of the Electoral College: The process of the Electoral College affords a moral certainty, that the office of the president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. In other words, Hamilton created that government body to remedy precisely this situation. In that spirit, here is what Keith Olbermann has to say on the matter, first quoting Hamilton: Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union? Then, Olbermann himself says: If the Electoral College is still not what Hamilton described, it is still what Hamilton intended. It is there to weed out the unqualified, the unprincipled, the merely famous. And especially to weed out  a creature  of foreign powers. Or, in Donald Trump s case, all of the above. That s just the thing. The Electoral College was never meant to be nothing but a formality and only a rubber stamp; quite the opposite, in fact. The meeting of the electors after the November election is supposed to be a serious deliberation on the qualifications of the president-elect. If they deem that person unfit, then the electors have not just the authority, but the patriotic   and indeed Constitutional   duty to install a person qualified for that office.Olbermann continues, this time turning to the confirmed Russian interference in our 2016 electoral process, with the clear intention   and eventual success   of electing Trump: Would it be an act of victory over the Russians who committed an act of war against us by interfering with our election? Would it be defense against Trump and this banana Republican government of his which will turn the world over to Vladimir Putin and, oh by the way, end our democracy? Before you answer that, answer this: We can t have Clinton, Alexander Hamilton is dead, and the alternative is an unelected dictator. Would you now trade Donald Trump for a President Mitt Romney, a President John McCain or a President Evan McMullin? Me? In a heartbeat! You re damn right I d take any of those three over Trump. As much as I d rather have Hillary, I ll take Romney or McCain gladly   and I d especially love McMullin, since he s been busily sounding the alarm on how dangerous Trump is this entire time. He is reasonable and would do a good job. Further, he isn t an extremist, just a run of the mill conservative.In short, Olbermann is right. It is time for the Electoral College to stop being a rubber stamp, and to do their job. They all know that Trump is unqualified, and therefore should not assume the office of the presidency.Watch the video below:It s as if 83,549 days ago Alexander Hamilton saw Trump coming and provided the way to stop him with HRC as the hero pic.twitter.com/lBCaVnXy3o  Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) December 15, 2016Featured image via Frederick M.

That s right   Trump only gets briefings once per week, and his Vice President Mike Pence gets these briefings six times per week.These briefings are so important that President Barack Obama, who has been running the country for eight years, still gets updated on a daily basis. So having someone as unqualified and stupid as Trump turn these briefings down is really terrifying.On Wednesday, former CIA director Leon Panetta pointed out the consequences of such ignorance when he stated that Trump could be held responsible for any future terror attack if he continued to refuse more regular briefings. Panetta said that Trump s resistance to knowing what is going on in the world beyond Twitter  can t last : I ve seen presidents who have asked questions about whether that intelligence is verifiable, what are the sources for that intelligence, but I have never seen a president who said,  I don t want that stuff.' If we endure another attack and the intelligence officials had indications or information regarding that attack and the president did not want to listen to that, for whatever reason, the responsibility for that attack would fall on the president. To refresh, Trump s reason for not receiving more frequent briefings   which he confidently broadcasted on Fox News over the weekend   was that they were repetitive and that he already knew about potential threats. Trump said in a fit of pure ignorance: You know, I m a smart person. I don t have to be told the same things in the same words every single day for the next eight years. Panetta (and the rest of America, pretty much) disagrees. The ex-CIA chief also advised that Trump should get on board with what the U.S. intelligence agencies are reporting regarding Russia s interference in the U.S. election   a claim that Trump has denied and called  ridiculous . Panetta said: When it comes to Russian interference in our last campaign, 17 intelligence agencies agree that Russia is involved in that effort. I think the President would do well to say we ought to find out what Russia s role was, we ought to investigate it and ensure that it never happens again. If Trump is to increase the amount of briefings he gets, it s going to be because he s forced to   not because he thinks he actually needs them. Trump is incapable of coming to terms with his excruciatingly obvious shortcomings, and it s going to backfire tremendously on America and its people.Featured image via Brian Blanco/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But Merrill is about to win a trip to prison after prosecutor David Pascoe officially charged him with 30 counts of ethics violations and misconductAccording to The State, Merrill is being accused of using his political office to receive over $1 million through his company, Greechie Communications, or directly.Merrill is accused of failing to disclose contributions and expenditures made to and from the House GOP Caucus operating account and improperly using that account for campaign purposes. That failure allowed Merrill to collect $164,564 from the House Republican Caucus without without accountability between Jan. 1, 2005 and Dec. 31, 2008, according to prosecutors.Merrill is charged with using his office for financial gain as a House member for receiving $108,169 to Geechie Communications from the GOP caucus just from Jan. 1, 2010 through Dec. 31, 2011.He is accused of using his position from 2005-2008 while serving as House GOP leader to direct $82,515 from the caucus to his PR firm.In addition, the indictment alleges Merrill directed $186,332 from the caucus to Geechie Communications, in excess of the fair market value for services it rendered between 2008 and 2010.In addition, Merrill  illegally received payments totaling at least $276,561 from the S.C. House Republican Caucus  through multiple accountsAnd those are just the tip of the iceberg.As it turns out Pascoe had to fight in court to keep the investigation because Attorney General Alan Wilson attempted to help Merrill, who happens to be his friend, by trying to assign another prosecutor to the case.This isn t the first time Trump has hired people who have since been charged with committing crimes.A Trump campaign staffer in Michigan was convicted of election fraud late last month.It makes one wonder just how many criminals Trump hired to help him win and how many will be in his administration.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Trump has since chosen a close friend of Putin s as Secretary of State and wants to end sanctions against Russia. Trump also expressed his intention to possibly abandon NATO, which would open the door for Russia to be more aggressive toward Europe with no United States to challenge them.The only reason why Republicans are fawning over Russia and Putin is because they would not have won the White House without their assistance. This is a sad time for our country. The political party that once saw Russia as our mortal enemy is now happy to be in Putin s pocket.

This week, Trump canceled a much-anticipated press conference on his private business dealings, saying he was too busy nominating Cabinet members, but he was seen meeting with Kanye West. Trump promised to address his conflicts of interest but we suppose meeting with a rapper is more of a priority for the president-elect. Trump has not held a press conference since July 27th even though he blasted Hillary Clinton for not meeting with the press during the campaign.Vox reports that Trump now has a different excuse for not meeting with the press for interviews:The press mangles his  beautiful  sentences, and he has had enough of it, Trump told a crowd in West Allis, Wisconsin, at one of his Victory Tour rallies.Trump literally said that.  For the last month I decided not to do interviews, because they give interviews and they chop up your sentences and cut them short,  he said.  You will have this beautiful flowing sentence where the back of the sentence reverts to the front and they cut the back of the sentence off, and I say I never said that. So, I said, you know what, I am not going to deal with them. They are very dishonest people, I said. Vox had linguists weigh in on Trump s speeches. His speeches are full of non sequiturs,  says Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a Calvin College historian who has done a comparative study of Trump and Clinton s speaking styles. It s a completely different style from nearly any other politician you normally see on a big stage.What s even more peculiar about his remark is that after each incendiary statement he made during his campaign, it was as if his defenders felt the need to step in to say what he really meant.

Last month, Flynn retweeted a fake news link that accused Hillary Clinton of engaging money laundering and sex crimes out of a D.C. pizza joint.

It s as bad as you d imagine. While he encourages men to dress to exhibit  authority,  the women have much different criteria. Women are to dress to look attractive, but not too attractive. Not gaudy but not plain. Women need to wear makeup, but not too much makeup. They should  accentuate the positive/disguise the negative. The most serious of Flynn s foibles, though, is a revelation that he shared classified information with foreign military officers in Afghanistan. The investigation took place in 2010, and it was determined that while he did  inappropriately share  classified information,  there was no actual or potential damage to national security.

The women included those who were able to get an abortion and those who were not able to get one. The purpose of the study sought to discover the mental effects of having an abortion or being denied an abortion.The results of the study will likely cause conservatives to throw temper tantrums.As it turns out, women suffer worse mental health consequences when they are denied the abortion they are seeking.In short, conservatives are lying when they claim that abortion causes long-term psychological problems.Dr. Diana Greene Foster, the co-author of the study, said that  mental health improves over time regardless of the outcome but the conservative claim that abortion is harmful to women s mental health is factually false. Eight days after seeking an abortion, women who were denied an abortion reported significantly more anxiety symptoms and lower self-esteem and life satisfaction, but similar levels of depression, as women receiving abortions; outcomes improved or remained steady over time,  the study concluded. Abortion denial may be initially associated with psychological harm to women and findings do not support restricting abortion on the basis that abortion harms women s mental health. At the time we started, there was a lot of debate and very little data about the actual mental-health consequences from abortion,  Foster said.  There was a public dialogue that abortion hurt women, but not much evidence, and even the best of studies didn t have a comparison group. So much of our debate is ideology with no factual reference to real women s experiences,  Foster continued.  What this study does is give an objective look at what real women making this decision and living their lives experience.

Seriously, though, Russia is thrilled with Trump s selections so far.But it is Rex Tillerson s nomination for Secretary of State that, as The Guardian notes,  confirms Vladimir Putin as one of the strategic victors of the US presidential election. The Wall Street Journal notes that  Friends and associates said few US citizens are closer to Mr Putin than Mr Tillerson.  And, of course, Tillerson will now be in a position to make a f*ckton of money in his new position, as The Guardian points out:The 2011 Exxon-Rosneft agreement was frozen when sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Exxon Mobil estimated the sanctions cost it $1bn and Tillerson has argued strenuously for the measures to be lifted. We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions,  he said, at a shareholders  meeting.In June, two years after sanctions were imposed and in an apparent show of support for Sechin, Tillerson reportedly turned up at a St Petersburg economic summit.If the sanctions were lifted, the Arctic project would probably go ahead and Tillerson s retirement fund of Exxon Mobil stock would increase in value. He would most likely have to divest himself of stock by the time he entered the office on the seventh floor of the state department. It might be harder to divorce his judgments entirely from the oil company where he spent his career.Tillerson s nomination can be called a lot of things   but pro-Kremlin Russian political commentator Sergei Markov calls it what it is:  some kind of Christmas gift from the American people to the Russian people  especially in light of the  artificial  Cold War  that was started with Russia  over the country s involvement in hacking Donald Trump s political enemies for him (at his request, no less).Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, which advises the Kremlin, says that Tillerson represents  profound changes in U.S. foreign policy  that stands to favor Russia heavily. Mr. Tillerson is very well known to the important people here, and neither Mr. Putin nor the others will need time to learn who he is and how to deal with him,  Lukyanov says.

Electors have the weight of the world on their shoulders as December 19 approaches.

Public Schools spokeswoman says she isn t aware of a single band in the district that had applied to participate in the January 20 inaugural parade.Trump s problem doesn t extend to just high school bands.

Alexander Hamilton wrote, in Federalist 68, that the purpose of the Electoral College was to prevent unqualified individuals (like demagogues such as Trump) from assuming the highest office in the land. One lawyer, who s actually a former presidential candidate himself, says that at least 20 Republican electors are ready to uphold Hamilton s ideal and reject Trump.We need 37 of them to flip their votes to anyone else. While it s unlikely they ll vote for Hillary instead, just denying Trump the minimum 270 votes he needs to secure the White House could have a major effect on how Congress decides the issue. According to Larry Lessig, who is a constitutional law professor at Harvard: Obviously, whether an elector ultimately votes his or her conscience will depend in part upon whether there are enough doing the same. We now believe there are more than half the number needed to change the result seriously considering making that vote. Lessig s anti-Trump group, known as  Electors Trust,  has been giving legal counsel to Republican electors who don t want to vote for Trump. They ve also been giving these electors a way to discuss their intentions privately, which is extremely important given that Trump has threatened to destroy any of  his  electors who don t vote for him.Of course, the RNC disagrees with this statistic vehemently. They ve been conducting a whip operation, which is basically an effort to ensure that all their electors plan to vote  properly.  They re only aware of Chris Suprun, a Texas elector who has gone on record numerous times as saying he s unable to vote for Trump. He s also been trying to convince his fellow Republican electors to follow his lead.Why would any Republican elector openly admit to the RNC that they re considering casting their votes for someone else? That s one thing the RNC doesn t seem to be considering. In fact, they re acting clueless about the discontent over Trump that exists within their party.And frankly, most of us would lie through our teeth if we were afraid an autocratic, thin-skinned, egotistical manchild of a Cheetolini was going to try and ruin us for defying him.This isn t set in stone, and we only have five days left before the Electoral College formally recognizes or denies Donald Trump, so there s no time to lose.

Republicans have largely sat on their hands because they don t care if a foreign power rigged our election as long as their candidate wins.But now Russia has a measure of control over the United States that they have never had before and that means Vladimir Putin was able to execute a coup in this nation without firing a single shot   and the unwillingness of Trump and Republicans to do anything about it enraged Keith Olbermann, who tore them to shreds for it. We are at war with Russia,  Olbermann began.  Or perhaps more correctly, we have lost a war with Russia without a battle. We are no longer a sovereign nation, we are no longer a democracy, we are no longer a free people, we are the victims of a bloodless coup. Indeed, if Russia and the GOP are allowed to get away with this coup, nothing stops Republicans from seeking help from foreign powers in any election. Democracy would be dead, and our government would no longer be chosen by the people.Olbermann shamed Republicans for not taking Russia s espionage seriously and wondered  if the Russians hacked the RNC and have kept what they found there to make sure Trump and the Republicans obeyed. That would certainly be an explanation for why Republicans have been defending Russia.And that s why Olbermann called for the immediate appointment of a special prosecutor and called for preventing Trump from taking office until we know what Trump knew and when he knew it. After all, Trump did encourage Russia to continue hacking our political process during the campaign.

Trump is already stocking his cabinet with pro-Russia officials, including Putin s personal friend Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. And because Trump wants to build a hotel in Moscow and owes Russia for getting him elected, it s likely Trump will be beholden to Putin, which means a weaker NATO and a weaker America as Russia grabs for power around the world with no United States to challenge them. It will not be a peaceful change of power   it will be a usurpation,  Olbermann concluded.  And the usurper has no validity, no credibility and no authority under the Constitution. This is a reality, and this will be the only reality until this country rids itself of Donald John Trump. He is not a president   he is a puppet. Here s the video via YouTube:Donald trump and the Republican Party are ignoring Russia s meddling because they won the election. If the situation were reversed and Hillary Clinton has won with Russia s help there is no denying that Republicans would be crying foul right now. So they need to stop being hypocrites and start standing up for the integrity of our election system. They need to keep Trump from taking office and the best way to do that is to get the Electoral College to vote against him. Our nation s future is at stake.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Unfortunately for Trump, they seem to be taking the Russian hacking thing seriously, demanding a full briefing before they vote. We intend to discharge our duties as Electors by ensuring that we select a candidate for president who, as our Founding Fathers envisioned, would be  endowed with the requisite qualifications,  the open letter from electors to U.S. Director Of National Intelligence.  [T]he Constitution envisions the Electoral College as a deliberative body that plays a critical role in our system of government   ensuring that the American people elect a president who is constitutionally qualified and fit to serve. According to reports in the Washington Post, New York Times, and other outlets, the United States intelligence community has now concluded definitively that the Russian interference was performed to help Donald Trump get elected, yet even today Mr. Trump is refusing to accept that finding,  the letter continues.  Separate from Mr. Trump s own denials of Russian involvement in the election, the confirmed communication between Trump s aides and those associated with the Russian election interference activity raise serious concerns that must be addressed before we cast our votes. This may present a problem for a guy whom the CIA confirmed had a lot of help from a foreign power via hacking and propaganda, but Trump s solution is simple (terrifyingly simple): threaten them into compliance. We have gotten reports from multiple people,  an elector told Salon under condition of anonymity,  that the Donald Trump campaign is putting pressure on Republican electors to vote for him based on . . . future political outcomes based on whether they vote for Donald Trump or not.  These reports, the elector says, come from Republican electors who say that violence was not threatened   instead, the Trump camp threatened to ruin careers and livelihoods. It s all political, basically,  the elector said.  If Trump becomes the president, he s going to be able to put pressure on the state parties and they won t be involved anymore. Let s think about this for a moment: the expected incoming President of the United States was revealed to have been effectively installed by a foreign power after asking them to hack his political opponents. The intelligence community has confirmed that Russia heard his plea for help and stepped up to get him into office. Now, instead of even feigning surprise, Trump is attacking and threatening anyone and everyone who says anything negative about it   the media, electors, even those same intelligence agencies whose investigations proved inconvenient for him.Keith Olbermann recently pointed out that if Trump assumes office, the chances of us ever having a free election again diminish severely. With Trump now threatening those whose job it is to ensure that a tyrant like him doesn t get into office, he seems to be right.Featured image via Getty Images/Steve Pope""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""During the revelations that Russia had a giant hand in influencing our election, one word has been used throughout the media: unprecedented. Well, unprecedented is not exactly true. While it is true that Russia s hacking has been blatant and Trump s involvement is becoming undeniable, this isn t the first time a foreign and hostile government has played a role in installing a Republican leader and we don t have to go very far back to see examples.Nearly 50 years ago, in 1968, the most famously scandal-ridden President began his term under a scandal. After his Democratic opponent Vice President Hubert Humphrey switched course from his president, Lyndon B. Johnson, and promised that we would pull out of the Vietnam war, Nixon began falling in the polls. On October 30th, Johnson, though, announced that there would be peace talks and Nixon s lead disappeared. So, Nixon invited Vietnam to intervene.Nixon s team met secretly with Anna Chan Chennault, a wealthy supporter of Taiwanese President Chiang Kai-shek, co-chair of Republican Women for Nixon and confidante of South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu. At Nixon s behest, Chennault informed Thieu that Nixon would secure a better deal for his country than either Humphrey or Johnson, and that the Democrats were effectively prepared to sell out Saigon in order to secure peace at any price. If Chennault could convince Thieu to stay away from the negotiating table, the talks would collapse, LBJ would look foolish and the Democrats  11th-hour gambit would fail.Johnson and the Democrats knew it was happening. The National Security Agency had intercepted cables between Thieu and his D.C. ambassador.( [I am] still in contact with the Nixon entourage, which continues to be the favorite despite the uncertainty provoked by the news of an imminent bombing halt,  one communiqu  began.) On the basis of these cables, LBJ ordered the FBI to tap Chennault s phone; the bureau, in turn, concluded that she  contacted Vietnamese Ambassador Bui Diem and advised him that she had received a message from her boss (not further identified) which her boss wanted her to give personally to the ambassador. She said the message was that the ambassador is to  hold on, we are gonna win  and that her boss also said,  Hold on, he understands all of it. Johnson didn t mince words. He called it  treason,  and a gross violation of the Logan Act, which prohibits civilians from negotiating with foreign governments. Still, there wasn t enough to firmly plant the smoking gun in Nixon s hands, so the American people didn t have this bit of information before the election.South Vietnam pulled out of the peace talks and well, we got a President Nixon. The rest is history, and well, people should be reminded that an administration that begins in scandal will likely end in scandal.The second recent instance happened fewer than 40 years ago. In 1979, university students in Tehran, Iran stormed the American embassy there and took 63 American hostages. In hindsight, we were kind of asking for it. In 1953, the CIA helped overthrow Iran s government because of oil. Instead, we installed the Shah, who was corrupt and brutal. When the Shah fell in 1979, then President Jimmy Carter allowed the Shah to seek medical treatment for cancer in the United States. Iran s new leader, Ayatollah Sayyid Ruhulla Musawi Khomeini, who hated us anyway, demanded extradition so the Shah could face trial. Carter refused.Still, as we were nearing the election, it appeared that the hostage situation was coming to a resolution, which would have nearly assured Carter of reelection. The Reagan camp couldn t let that happen. Reagan s campaign manager, William Casey talked to sources close to the ayatollah and convinced them to delay the release of the hostages. Reagan went on to win the election and the hostages were released on inauguration day.Of course, details of both these cases are different from the details in the Trump/Russia hacking scandal, but I would argue that today we are in a worse situation. By helping Trump, Russia is providing themselves blackmail ammo in case Trump does something they might not find agreeable. More than that, though, in the days when cyber security is at the top of everyone s minds, what Russia has done to us is as dangerous as any terrorist act and the ramifications are far bigger. Trump has allowed a hostile foreign government to infiltrate our electronic communication, which is almost everything. What s next, credit card information and IRS records of individuals who speak out against Trump?The bottom line is that we can t allow Donald Trump to take office. There s too much at stake. We can t afford another Nixon. We can t even afford another Reagan.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They hope to have a conversation with Pence to discuss the negative impacts of fake news. As we are sure you are aware, Comet Ping Pong, a beloved neighborhood restaurant, has been under a savage attack as the result of a detestable  fake news  story, claiming that the restaurant and its owner are involved in a child exploitation ring tied to Hillary Clinton,  the letter reads.  This falsehood first appeared on so-called  alt-right  news sites and then quickly spread across the Internet. Although it is preposterous on its face and has been repeatedly debunked by law enforcement, the story has provoked a deluge of death threats, menacing visits, and other threatening conduct aimed at the restaurant and its employees.

Heck, he doesn t necessarily even believe that science is real. Maybe global warming is just a Chinese  hoax,  right? And the people he has picked for his cabinet are far from environmentally friendly.Well, scientists have taken notice and are taking action. They are scrambling to copy U.S. climate data before Trump s administration has the chance to make it all just disappear.The Washington Post reports:The efforts include a  guerrilla archiving  event in Toronto, where experts will copy irreplaceable public data, meetings at the University of Pennsylvania focused on how to download as much federal data as possible in the coming weeks, and a collaboration of scientists and database experts who are compiling an online site to harbor scientific information.Nick Santos, an environmental researcher at the University of California at Davis, is one of the scientists who is not risking it. Over the weekend he started copying government climate data onto a public server. Something that seemed a little paranoid to me before all of a sudden seems potentially realistic, or at least something you d want to hedge against,  Santos said. Doing this can only be a good thing. Hopefully, they leave everything in place. But if not, we re planning for that. Michael Halpern, who is the deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists, said in an email that the people Trump has picked to head up government agencies so far have been a  band of climate conspiracy theorists. They have been salivating at the possibility of dismantling federal climate research programs for years. It s not unreasonable to think they would want to take down the very data that they dispute,  he wrote.  There is a fine line between being paranoid and being prepared, and scientists are doing their best to be prepared. . . . Scientists are right to preserve data and archive websites before those who want to dismantle federal climate change research programs storm the castle. Trump has never said he intends to manipulate scientific data, but scientists located across the country aren t taking chances. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are feverishly trying to figure out the best ways to copy and preserve their data.The University of Toronto is holding a guerrilla archiving  event this weekend to collect vital federal environmental data before Trump takes office. According to organizers, the event  is focused on preserving information and data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which has programs and data at high risk of being removed from online public access or even deleted. This includes climate change, water, air, toxics programs. Lawyers with the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund will be available to meet one-on-one with concerned researchers at the American Geophysical Union s fall meeting in San Francisco. The organization is also handing out booklets at the event titled,  Handling Political Harassment and Legal Intimidation: A Pocket Guide for Scientists. We literally thought about it the day after the election,  said Lauren Kurtz, the legal defense fund s executive director.  I have gotten a lot of calls from scientists who are really concerned. . . . So it s intended in some ways to be reassuring, to say,  There is a game plan; we re here to help you. Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist who describes himself as a  climate hawk,  issued a call to action via Twitter on Saturday when he posted, Scientists: Do you have a US .gov climate database that you don t want to see disappear?  Mountains of data immediately began pouring in. I don t actually think that it will happen,  he said of the possibility that Trump s administration could alter or destroy scientific data.  But I think it could happen. . . . All of these data sets are priceless, in the sense that if there is a gap, it greatly diminishes their usefulness.

Some of the questions asked left many in our workforce unsettled,  said Eben Burnham-Snyder, a department spokesman.  Our career workforce, including our contractors and employees at our labs, comprise the backbone of DOE (Department of Energy) and the important work our department does to benefit the American people. We are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees at our labs and across our department. We will be forthcoming with all publically-available information with the transition team. We will not be providing any individual names to the transition team.  Burnham-Snyder s email had the last sentence in boldface for emphasis.So lets just recap.

We desperately need to address it or many of our coastal cities, including our nation s capital, could be under water in a matter of decades. And it would kill our economy and leave millions of people homeless regardless of their political affiliations.Trump is targeting the Department of Energy and is demanding names he should never receive. Federal employees should not be persecuted for doing their jobs and they certainly should not be persecuted for understanding science.

So has the United Nations. But because Trump has a hotel that is nearing completion in the Philippines, he is already sucking up to Duterte. Trump has even invited Duterte to the White House.That s right, Trump is palling around with a mass murderer because he doesn t want to lose money. Seriously.According to Newsweek,The Trump family has an enormous financial interest in keeping Duterte happy. Trump Tower at Century City in Makati, Philippines, is on the verge of completion, with potential buyers having placed deposits on at least 94 percent of the condominiums, according to Century Properties, the Trump Organization s business partner there.In addition, Trump has also been trying to build hotels and resorts in Taiwan, which is probably the reason why he pissed off China by calling the Taiwanese president. American presidents have recognized China as the one and only China in the world since 1979, which is why presidents do not directly contact Taiwan. By doing so, Trump is signaling that he recognizes Taiwan as a nation, something the Chinese dispute. But once again, Taiwan has leverage over Trump because his business is trying to build resorts there. So Trump is willing to risk war with China for the sake of profiting from Taiwan. Trump could also be just using the threat of doing business in Taiwan in order to force Beijing to allow Trump to build hotels in China instead.The same goes for Russia, too. Trump has been trying to build a hotel in Moscow for decades. Now he can give Vladimir Putin something in return for allowing construction to commence. In other words, Trump may drop all sanctions against Russia and ignore their aggression towards Europe in exchange for a multi-million dollar business deal for himself and his children.Turkey is currently trying to blackmail Trump by holding his financial interests hostage. Turkish President Erdogan had a Turkish executive who works with Trump s business partner arrested, which is putting pressure on the cash flow Trump s company receives from Turkey. Millions of dollars are at stake if Trump doesn t bow down to Erdogan s demand that the United States hand over a person the Turkish government claims is a terrorist, even though they have provided no evidence to support the claim. Once Trump takes office, he will likely do what Turkey wants in order to keep the money flowing to his pockets.Trump also has conflicts of interest with Japan and Argentina.When Ivanka Trump sat in during her father s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and was included in a phone call with Argentine President Mauricio Macri, there were business deals at stake in both countries.At the same time, officials with her clothing company were working on a licensing agreement with Sanei International. The largest shareholder of Sanei s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, which is wholly owned by the Japanese government headed by Abe.And Argentina recently stopped blocking a building project from moving forward after Trump and his daughter spoke with Macri on the phone only days after the election.In short, Trump is using the presidency to increase his family s fortune instead of dong what is best for our country. And this is a major threat to our democracy and our security because other nations now have the power to influence Trump simply by threatening to pull the plug on building projects or cutting off profits from being sent to Trump s bank account. It s a MAJOR conflict of interest that sets up a constitutional crisis the second Trump takes office. And that cannot be allowed to happen if we do not want America to be trampled over by foreign governments.Featured image via Steve Pope/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

During an MSNBC town hall in Kenosha, Wisconsin (aka  Trump Country ), Sanders confronted Trump voter Gail Sparks about her inaccurate views on what Trump actually stood for.Sparks admitted that she hadn t voted in 2012, but got herself to the polls for Trump this year because she wanted change. She connected with his fear mongering about undocumented immigrants   she even called them  those people  and accused them of stealing jobs and being the reason she made less money. But when Sparks brought up the social safety net, Sanders couldn t take it anymore and had to stop her in her tracks to give her the facts. Sparks said: Who s paying for this? Who s paying for the Medicaid? Who s paying for the Social Security? Who s paying for the Medicare? Now, have any of you seen down on the streets that it seems as though we have become the silent minority and not the majority? MSNBC host Chris Hayes asked Sparks who she was talking about and Sparks responded, The people who need the Medicare, the people who need the Social Security, who need the help with the education. That s when Sanders respectfully decided to prove to her that she d made the wrong choice when she voted. Sanders said: Good point. Let s see if we can go forward on this. I am assuming that you believe, correct me if I m wrong, that we should not cut Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid. Is that correct or not? Sanders let Sparks agree that the social safety net shouldn t be cut before dropping an epic truth bomb. He continued: Do you know who is now working very hard to try to do that? Republicans in Congress have a plan under the guise of saving Medicare and saving Social Security, making devastating cuts. That s what the Republicans are now trying to do. As Sanders went on, a look of shock, disappointment and embarrassment washed across Sparks  face   but Sanders didn t stop: The other point that you made is, who is going to pay for this stuff? And that is a very fair point. What all of us should know is that over the last 25 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth in this country from you to the top one-tenth of one percent. In other words, the middle class has shrunk and trillions of dollars have gone to the top one-tenth of one percent. Do you think it s inappropriate to start asking those people to pay their fair share of taxes so we can adequately fund Medicaid and make public colleges and universities tuition-free. Is that an unfair thing to ask? Sparks took a second to digest what Sanders was saying and replied, I don t think it s an unfair thing to ask. They got rich off of us, so it s time they put back. Sanders said,  Okay, that s what I m saying. This conversation between Sparks and Sanders proves that a lot of Trump supporters have no idea what Trump and the GOP are actually doing, and they re just as unclear on Trump s policies as he is.

Now that Donald Trump has been kinda-sorta elected president by a historic minority of voters and a system put in place thanks to lobbying by slave owners, Republicans have decided that a headline-grabbing fake investigation into Hillary Clinton just isn t necessary anymore.In multiple desperate attempts to blame the tragic Benghazi terrorist attacks on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, Republicans spent years betraying taxpayers by knowingly wasting millions of their dollars doing their best not to uncover the truth, but to turn public perception against the president and the former secretary of state. Principled  conservatives and other stupid people rallied around the cause as Trump and Stein supporters, unable to tell fact from fiction, used Benghazi and any other fake scandal they heard about on Infowars to demand that Clinton be jailed or even executed for imagined crimes.Yes, it was propaganda   it was effective taxpayer-funded propaganda. But it s over now. Trump will be our next president, the committee has lost interest, and (most importantly),  the truth of the millions-of-dollars-worth of investigations is laid bare: it was all an effort to hoodwink voters. Every. Single. Bit. Of. It.While the panel s chairman, Trey Gowdy, loudly trumpeted every facet of this witch hunt at every step of the way, the final report was added to the official house record without so much as a peep from him. The reason? He d accomplished his purpose. There s no longer any need for him to abuse his position to play politics now that the game he was playing is over. USA Today has a nice rundown of the damage that was done:The special committee was created in May 2014 to investigate the terrorist attacks at the U.S. compound in eastern Libya where four Americans died, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.In June, the Benghazi Committee report was endorsed by the Republican committee members but not the Democrats. It severely criticized military, CIA and Obama administration officials for their response as the attacks unfolded and their subsequent explanations to the American people. It accused the government of incompetence at various levels, including a failure to deploy needed military assets, CIA intelligence reports that were  rife with errors,  and misguided planning even in the midst of the violence. The report did not single out wrongdoing by then-secretary of State Hillary Clinton, although some Republicans on the panel alleged that overall concern for her political future influenced and hampered some of the decision-making surrounding policy in Libya.Clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of State was revealed as part of the Benghazi investigation, but the committee did not investigate whether the setup led to improper handling of classified information. The FBI declined to pursue criminal charges regarding the email system, but it was a major issue in the 2016 presidential election.Gowdy on Monday called the report the  final, definitive accounting  of the Benghazi attacks. The committee is proud to have been able to tell the story of the ingenuity and bravery displayed by our nation s heroes in Benghazi, who banded together to save one another when no other help was ever on the way,  Gowdy said when asked about the report. But Rep. Elijah Cummings, the panel s Batman to Gowdy s Aryan Joker, was quick to call it what it was. Republicans voted on this partisan report five months ago, but delayed filing it and completing the committee until after the election,  Cummings says.  Republicans promised a process that was fair and bipartisan, but the American people got exactly the opposite. If any Republican mentions any aspect of the Benghazi investigation to you ever again, be sure to point out that conservative  principles  only exist long enough for them to work to someone s political benefit. Then they just disappear like this investigation did after Trump  won  and Ebola after the midterms.Featured image via Getty Images/Mark Wilson""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It s been more like a reality show and a quest for public humiliation and revenge than the dignified affair that it has been for presidents past. Now, Team Trump has another problem: The inauguration. You see, usually, presidents-elect have pop stars and other A-list stars from around the globe scrambling to get a spot at the plum event. For instance, Barack Obama had the likes of Beyonce and Aretha Franklin celebrating his swearing in. Not the case, however, for Donald Trump. In fact, the opposite seems to be true.According to BBC News, the Trump team is so desperate for inaugural talent that they are actually offering to pay the stars to come   something that never happens. Of course, Trump s Inaugural Committee is denying this, saying via spokesman Boris Epshteyn: No one with any official position at, or official relationship with, the presidential committee is engaging in the conduct described. Of course, this is likely a lie, since another mouthpiece from Trump s inaugural clown car lied and said that Sir Elton John would be showing up. As soon as that news was out of the box, Sir Elton s publicist released a strongly-worded rebuke of Team Trump that said: Incorrect. He will NOT be performing. There is no truth in this at all. Further, a source close to the inaugural efforts said of the team s desperation: They re calling managers, agents, everyone in town to see who they can get and it s been problematic. They are willing to pay anything. Other stars weighed in as well. Singer John Legend says that he is  not surprised at all,  and continued: Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate. We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that s preaching division and hate and bigotry, it s unlikely he ll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him. Queen frontman and American Idol star Adam Lambert said of the potential gig, even if there was lots of cash involved: I don t think I would take the money on that one. I don t think I d be endorsing that. They might struggle. Less well-known singer Matt Healy, who fronts The 1975, seemed to think the whole thing might be good for a laugh: I ll do it if they give me cash up front. Then watch what would happen. It would be a riot. Even the comedy isn t enough for Healy, though, as he continued: What do I want? Well, he s got gold seatbelts in his plane   so at least a million quid. Well, this ought to be an interesting affair. It will probably look like the Republican National Convention did, with people like Pastor Mark Burns and Sheriff Clarke giving hateful, hellfire and brimstone speeches, with Chris Christie once again prosecuting Hillary Clinton from the stage, protesters outside, and with the only musical talent being people like Kid Rock and Ted Nugent.Get ready for another national disgrace courtesy of Donald Trump, folks.

Jones and Stone are both conspiracy nuts, but what Stone told Jones was no conspiracy. According to Stone, Trump only interviewed Mitt Romney for the Secretary of State position to  torture him  for refusing to endorse the Orange Man. Donald Trump was interviewing Mitt Romney for Secretary of State in order to torture him,  Stone claimed on the program.  To toy with him. And given the history, that s completely understandable. Mitt Romney crossed a line. He didn t just oppose Trump, which is his democratic right, he called him a phony and a fraud. And a con man. And that s not the kind of man you want as Secretary of State. While Trump s official team hasn t confirmed or denied Stone s allegations, it s far from out of character for Trump, who seems to relish in vindictive retribution.Actual (we can t confirm or deny that Trump is a billionaire either) billionaire Richard Branson called Trump vindictive and dangerous.What concerns me most, based upon my personal experiences with Donald Trump, is his vindictive streak, which could be so dangerous if he got into the White House. For somebody who is running to be the leader of the free world to be so wrapped up in himself, rather than concerned with global issues, is very worrying.Trump has vowed to sue all the women who accused him of sexual misconduct. In fact, Trump threatens to sue everyone who crosses him. He cuts off media sources when they write negative things about him.A psychologist had this to say about Trump:Psychology research shows that vindictiveness is strongly correlated with narcissism, a personality trait that countless psychologists say Trump shows all the signs of having. Studies have also found that those who seek revenge are often very energetic and have dominant personalities. Further, vengeful people often seek powerful positions that allow them to inflict what they see as well-deserved hurt on their enemies. That pretty much describes Trump to a T.If, in fact, Trump did only invite Romney to meet with him to  torture him,  this is beyond troubling.

And tonight, on  The Daily Show,  Obama directly accused Trump of being responsible for Russia s interference.Obama spent some time talking about the ACA and why it shouldn t be repealed, but that s not really what makes this episode a must-see. Obama went so far as to blame Trump s request to Russia however much his sycophantic dick-blowers were when they claimed he was joking at the RNC for the results of our election.Noah asked Obama about the intelligence on Russia, and the rush to get it out, and Obama said: [W]hen the DNC got hacked, we immediately assigned our intelligence community, our law enforcement, to investigate what had happened. And we determined and announced in October that it was the consensus of the all the intelligence agencies and law enforcement that organizations affiliated with Russian intelligence were responsible for the hacking of the DNC materials that were being leaked.So that was a month before the election; this was not a secret. And the reason that I have called for a review is really just to gather all the threads of the investigations; the intelligence work that has been done over many months so that the public and our elected representatives, going forward, can find ways to prevent this kind of interference from having an impact on the elections in the future.

Bloomberg said: President-elect Donald Trump is postponing until next month a previously announced news conference to outline how he ll handle his far-flung business operations while in the White House, according to senior Trump transition officials.Trump had planned to make the announcement Dec. 15 but wants more time because he s been occupied with filling out his cabinet and top administration posts, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Spicer said that any evidence that the Kremlin was trying to help Trump win is based on the fact that the RNC was hacked, and it was not hacked.  He said: That does call into question the intelligence and the conclusions they came to. Snow then asked Spicer to clarify whether or not he is saying he doesn t believe the CIA   and that s when Spicer devolved into a toddler (obviously taking hints from Trump) and began throwing a temper tantrum.

China views Taiwan as a rogue province and the U.S. agreed not to recognize their government as part of the  One China  policy. Naturally, Trump has no f*cks to give.Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, published a scathing editorial on Monday slamming Trump for his remarks regarding the One China policy. They speculated  that Trump may use the policy to force China to make a compromise on trade. The One China policy is not for selling. Trump thinks that everything can be valued and, as long as his leverage is strong enough, he can sell or buy. If a price can be put on the US Constitution, will the American people sell their country s constitution and implement the political systems of Saudi Arabia or Singapore?Trump needs to learn to handle foreign affairs modestly, especially the China-U.S. relationship. More importantly, a hard struggle against Trump is needed to let him know that China and other world powers cannot be easily taken advantage of. The piece then lays out the following threat, most likely in reference to North Korea:  If Trump gave up the One China policy, publicly supported Taiwan independence and wantonly sold weapons to Taiwan, China would have no grounds to partner with Washington on international affairs and contain forces hostile to the U.S. In response to Trump s provocations, Beijing could offer support, even military assistance to U.S. foes. The One China policy has maintained peace and prosperity in Taiwan,  notes the article, before adding that the  U.S. has no control over the Straits, and Trump is na ve to think he can use the One China policy as a bargaining chip to win economic benefits from China. The editorial then offers Trump an out, because they do realize that he is a babbling idiot, saying,  It s very likely that Trump may not have put too much thought into it. He is no geopolitical maniac, but just has little experience in diplomacy. He doesn t understand how dangerous it can be when he involves the U.S. in such an explosive game. After all, this requires some personal experience. But the piece then ends with a warning to the world: China needs to be fully armed and prepared to take a Sino-U.S. rollercoaster relationship together with Trump. And many others in the world will probably also need to fasten their seatbelts. China has filed an official complaint with the U.S. government regarding Trump s chat fest with the Taiwanese leader.

The man you re going to see today is just a man in a suit, dressed up like Santa, but Santa does not exist,  Grisham said.  Parents, y all need to stop lying to your children and telling them that Santa Claus is real when, in fact, he s not. Grisham continued to repeat that Santa isn t real and told parents they should be teaching them about Jesus instead. When you substitute the lie of Santa Claus in the heart of your child for the truth of Jesus Christ, you are bearing false witness against God. Don t lie to your children and tell them there s such a thing as Santa, when you know in reality that there are no flying reindeer, there is no workshop at the North Pole, there is no elves making toys, that you buy all the gifts and put them under the tree. Some angry fathers confronted Grisham to make his leave. Quit talking this mess, you understand me?  one man tells Grisham.  Now stop. I ve got my kids over there, we don t need you coming over here and blabbing whatever the hell you re blabbing. Now go on   go. Now. That s not your decision to tell my kids what s the truth and what s not. Here s the video via YouTube.This is the example of the so-called  war on Christmas  that Fox News has been looking for, but they won t report on it because it s a conservative pastor waging it.In fact, there is more evidence that Santa Claus is real than there is that Jesus is real.While scholars rely on the Bible as their source for Jesus  existence, the person we call Santa Claus today was born Nikolaos of Myra in 3rd century Greece and was declared a saint during the 4th century. Saint Nicholas is reputed to have performed miracles, and his reputation for secretly giving gifts to people in need gave rise to the story of Santa Claus. Over time the life of Saint Nick was blended with Nordic folktales that have turned into the story of Santa we know so well today. Sure, the story of Santa Claus has changed through the centuries to include a sleigh, flying reindeer, milk and cookies, going down chimneys, elves making toys, and living at the North Pole, but Santa is still based in reality and there is evidence that he existed.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay? Clinton brought it up again during the second debate. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election,  she said.  And believe me, they re not doing it to get me elected. They re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. Trump responded, maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know   I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.

Ten Electoral College electors penned an open letter to ask U.S. intelligence officials for more information on ongoing investigations into Trump s relationship with Russia.The group of electors, including the daughter of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), wrote the letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper asking for the information ahead of their Dec. 19th meeting in which they are to formally vote for the next president. The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations,  the letter states.  We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States. Allegations that Donald Trump was receiving assistance from a hostile foreign power to win the election began months before Election Day,  the letter continues.  When presented with information that the Russian government was interfering in the election through the course of the campaign, both in private briefings and public assessment, Donald Trump rejected it, refused to condemn it, and continued to accept their help. Donald Trump even made a direct plea to the Russian government to interfere further in the election in a press conference on July 27, saying,  Russia, if you re listening, I hope you re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. The letter also notes:Russian government officials revealed that they had maintained contact with the Trump campaign during the election, and stated that they were familiar with most of the individuals associated with Mr. Trump.Media inquiries into whether the FBI was investigating Donald Trump s July plea for Russian interference in the election resulted in a  Glomar response  neither confirming nor denying the existence of an investigation, rather than the more typical response of denying the request outright.U.S. intelligence officials reportedly probed Trump foreign policy advisor Carter Page in regard to travel to his Moscow during the campaign.The FBI reportedly began an inquiry into Trump associates following reports of a multi-million dollar business relationship with pro-Putin figures in Ukraine and Russia, and reports of an effort to sway American public opinion in favor of Ukraine s pro-Putin government.Michael Flynn, Trump campaign aide and the announced incoming National Security Advisor, traveled to Russia in December of 2015 for a gala event celebrating RT, a state-controlled propaganda network, at which he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin.The letter is signed by nine Democrats and one Republican. If Trump is sworn into office, his administration will be the most compromised in U.S. history.

Look, it s time to take sides,  she began.  The election is over. You re either with us or against us. That is, with the United States or against the United States. As you may recall, President Bush and conservatives used this same phrase often to question the patriotism of Americans who opposed war in Iraq. We have a new president-elect. His name is Donald J. Trump. So move over Barack,  Pirro continued, going on to refer to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats as  namby pamby pathetic losers. Pirro then made a bullshit claim. There was a time in this country when we were united behind the flag in celebration of America s new president, our new leader. We all did in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected. We had high hopes for a united country, irrespective of our politics. It s time for the left, assuming they re capable, to show the same dignity and class, to the 45th president-elect. When President Obama took office in 2008, Republicans vowed to make him and America fail. They obstructed at every turn, called him every name in the book, and disrespected him. They even declared their love and allegiance to foreign leaders like Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu. So Pirro is a damned liar for daring to claim that Republicans united behind President Obama because they absolutely did not. Republican leaders had a meeting before he was even in office and agreed to block him at every turn and make him a  one term president. Then Pirro suggested that investigating Russia for interfering with our election is also un-American. You know, because America somehow has a long tradition of letting Russia rig the election for the presidential candidate they prefer. This isn t about the election, is it Mr. President?  she asked.  This is about domestic politics. It s not about November 2016, it s about January 2017 and your attempt to prevent Donald Trump from the smooth transition of power and your inability to face the overwhelming Electoral College win that the American people gave him. Except Trump s supposed  victory  was not even close to being  overwhelming.  He lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes and his Electoral College margin is one of the smallest in the last 100 years. Even President Obama s victories in 2008 and 2012 were bigger. So in anyone had a mandate to lead, it was Obama. And Republicans worked to sabotage him.Pirro demanded to know why everyone is  so obsessed with Russia  and claimed that she would rather sympathize with Putin because he s supposedly a  Christian.  Yeah, a  Christian  who murders political opponents and denies his people basic human rights. I despise all dictators,  she claimed,  but between the dictator that thinks I m an infidel and wants to have our heads cut off and the dictator from whom I simply want to keep my distance  the choice is a no-brainer. Here s the video via YouTube:In other words, like other crazy Republicans, Pirro loves Putin and has no problem with Russia rigging our election as long as they rig it in favor of the conservative candidate. That s a dangerous path that could lead to Republicans seeking help from foreign powers to help them win elections in the future. And the only way we can stop it is to investigate and if Russia did help Trump win, he should be disqualified immediately and we should either hold a new election or install Hillary Clinton as the rightful winner.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Unfortunately for the world, that wasn t a deal breaker for the 25 percent of Americans who voted for the demagogic self-described billionaire. Since rumored sexual assault isn t a big enough deal to keep someone out of the White House, why not put more people who are accused of violence against women in, right?As Trump has named cabinet pick after cabinet pick, each worse than the one before them, the fact that each comes with a controversial past seems to bother no one on the right.Trump s pick for national security advisor is a white nationalist who tweeted this:U decide   NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes w Children, etc MUST READ! https://t.co/O0bVJT3QDr  General Flynn (@GenFlynn) November 3, 2016His secretary of education hates schools. His pick for the head of the Environmental Protection Agency doesn t believe the environment needs protecting and (how s this for draining the swamp?) his treasure secretary pick is a former Goldman Sachs exec   you know   one of the companies that crashed the economy. It gets worse, though. According to Alternet, three of Trump s key team members have been accused of sexually or otherwise violently assaulting women.The first is the charmer, Steve Bannon. In a 1996 report, the white supremacist and former head of Breitbart was accused by his then wife of grabbing her by the neck during an argument. He was charged with domestic violence, misdemeanor witness intimidation and traumatic injury and battery. The charges were dropped, though, because his wife didn t show up for court.This one will probably surprise few. Trump s pick for labor secretary is fast food CEO Andrew Puzder. His restaurants include Hardee s and Carl s Jr., both of which are known for scantily clad women in near pornographic situations in their ads. During their divorce, Puzder s ex-wife accused him of attacking her three times, including punching her when they were riding in a car.Then, in 1986, Henning said Puzder  attacked me, choked me, threw me to the floor, hit me in the head, pushed his knee into my chest, twisted my ar m and dr agged me   on the floor, threw me against a wall, tried to stop my call to 911 and kicked me in the back. Source: NY MagazinePuzder responded to a reporter who asked him about the incident in a way that sounds a lot like his soon to be boss. He issued a thinly veiled threat against the reporter: There was no physical abuse at any point in time. If ever something was filed to gain personal benefit, this is it. If you re trying to smear me by raising the fact that my ex-wife made some charges against me, you re making a big mistake. It would not be good journalistic practice to publish this. Puzder s ex-wife has withdrawn the charges.Trump has also had numerous charges of sexual assault levied against him, beginning with his ex-wife Ivana.

On Sunday, Bolton appeared on Fox News to let the world know to ignore the CIA s evidence that Russia actively worked to install The Donald in the Oval Office because it s all big gubmint propaganda or something  a  false flag operation,  to be exact.Yes, this is a term that we have heard applied to the Sandy Hook shooting and pretty much anything that places conservatives in the uncomfortable position of having to self-analyze their horrific positions on guns, race, gender, and other topics. The phrase was largely made popular by Trump ally Alex Jones and deceased right-wing propagandist Andrew Breitbart (Yeah, the guy conservatives think Obama had killed for knowing too much. They ve even combined this conspiracy theory with the one about Hillary Clinton having child sex slaves in some circles. But I digress) and usually virtually assures that the person who uttered the term is a f*cking idiot.Which, of course, brings us to Bolton. It s not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation  are words actually uttered by someone Trump just placed in a very important position. Talking Points Memo provided a pretty handy transcript of what went down:BOLTON: It s not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation. Let s remember what FBI director James Comey said dealing with Hillary s home brew server. He said we found no direct evidence of foreign intelligence service penetration, but given the nature of this, we didn t expect to. Meaning, a really sophisticated foreign intelligence service would not leave any cyber fingerprints. And yet people say they did leave cyber fingerprints in the hacks regarding our election. So the question that has to be asked is why did the Russians run their smart intelligence service against Hillary s server but their dumb intelligence services against the election  SHAWN: When you say false flag, that s a very serious charge. False flag by whom? Here is  The Washington post.  The Post reported the CIA has concluded individuals with close ties to the Russian government hacked the e-mails. Intelligence officials have determined that Russia s goal was to help trump win rather than simply undermine confidence in the election. Are you actually accusing someone here in this administration of trying   in the intelligence community of trying to throw something?BOLTON: We just don t know, but I believe that intelligence has been politicized in the Obama administration to a very significant degree.SHAWN: Would the intelligence officials politicize this to go so far that could damage our republic and what we have for 200-plus years stood for.BOLTON: I think the whole thing is called into question and an independent investigation becomes extremely important. I think it s critical to answer the question I posed. If you think the Russians did this, then why did they leave fingerprints?SHAWN: Maybe because we have such sophisticated and  BOLTON: James Comey and the FBI couldn t find any fingerprints  SHAWN: They use a different standard. It s been shown they have a criminal start by the CIA has more of an intellectual  BOLTON: Let s hear the debate.SHAWN: What do you want to hear? Something from the CIA director?BOLTON: I d like to know. I think we have something now. We don t want to compromise intelligence sources and methods but when you make that kind of allegation, if it were true, and the Russians have the capability and the intention of doing it, I m not by any means trying to exonerate them, but if you say they ve done that, let me be clear, either in the cyber world or elsewhere, we should retaliate. It is unacceptable for the American constitution to be assaulted by foreigners in that way. So it is absolutely critical as well that we get the facts right on this, and I don t think we have anywhere enough in the public domain to know what the facts are.SHAWN: The president has ordered a review. Senator McCain and others of the Armed Services Committee are having hearings on this with the new congress. Let me read you a statement from both Senators McCain, SenatorsGraham, Schumer, and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, both bipartisan. For years foreign adversaries have directed cyber attacks at America s physical, economic, and military infrastructure while stealing our intellectual property. Now our institutions have been targeted. Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American. This cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. McCain this morning called Putin a thug, a killer, and a murderer. The president has ordered a public review. What are you calling on the president to do before January 20th? To reveal the classified information? To bring it all out so Americans can know if Russia had a hand in this election?BOLTON: One thing that makes me very nervous is Barack Obama saying let s have this report before the 20th of January so I can wrap it up. I think the burden for well or ill is going to fall on Mike Pompeo who has been named as president-elect trump s cia director. I think he s trusted by republicans and democrats. He doesn t bring any baggage. He s a new official at the CIA. I d look to him to head up an investigation across the entire intelligence committee. I just think these are such serious charges, again, if the Russians or any other foreign government think that they can undermine the integrity of our elections or defeat our constitutional process, this is just as serious an attack as a military attack.SHAWN: For those who are bothered by your claim of a potential false flag, that s very disturbing as an American.BOLTON: We would want to know who else might want to influence the election and why they would leave fingerprints that point to the Russians. That s why I say until we know more about how the insurance   intelligence community came to this conclusion  While he didn t say definitively that he believed this to be a  false flag,  Bolton made it clear that he might-or-might-not believe that President Obama   whose administration has a history of politicizing intelligence  to a very significant degree,  wink, wink   might or might not have told the CIA to falsely claim that Russia helped Donald Trump get elected because reasons.

However, the two sources who spoke to reporters said that the New Jersey governor was not offered the one position he had coveted and ass kissed for after his own bid for the presidency went down in flames: attorney general.The sources said that Christie just didn t think any of the positions he was offered were a good fit for him.

When Christie s own White House dreams went up in smoke, he quickly fell in line behind Trump. Christie was put in charge of Trump s transition team in May and for a while, it looked as if he might be chosen as Trump s running mate.A few weeks ago, shortly after Trump won the election, Christie announced that he would be serving out his final term as New Jersey governor. For some reason, people think I m equivocal about this,  the governor said  on Nov. 29. And I m not. I m completing my term.

Carl Bernstein was one of the Washington Post reporters who broke the scandal wide open.Throughout his presidency, Richard Nixon repeatedly lied and misled people. And when Watergate happened, he tried to cover it up by any means necessary. In the end, Nixon was forced to resign because he was going to be impeached. He remains the only president who has ever resigned the office and the Watergate scandal became the scandal by which other political scandals are judged.Well, Donald Trump has spent the last few days defending Russia and desperately trying to cover up the fact that Russia hacked into our election to help Trump win. He doesn t believe the CIA assessment concluding that Russia interfered and claimed on Fox News Sunday that Democrats are pushing a lie to taint his  great victory. In short, Trump threw American intelligence agencies under the bus to defend Putin and accused Democrats of making up a scandal. This is something that Richard Nixon would do. But unlike Trump, Nixon didn t deny facts at every turn, nor did he lie every time he spoke.Trump does exactly that on Twitter every day, launching attacks and smear campaigns against anyone who criticizes him or runs a story he doesn t like. Trump also exaggerates his supposed accomplishments like the Carrier deal, which is nothing more than a windfall for Carrier at taxpayer expense while jobs are slashed anyway.Carl Bernstein knows this first-hand, which is why he declared Trump a bigger liar than Nixon during an appearance on CNN. Trump lives and thrives in a fact-free environment,  Bernstein said.  No president, including Richard Nixon, has been so ignorant of fact and disdains fact in the way that this president-elect does. And it has something to do with the growing sense of authoritarianism that he and his presidency are projecting and the danger of it is obvious and he s trying to make the conduct of the press the issue, not his own conduct. Bernstein used Trump s Carrier deal as an example of his lies and Trump s attack against a steelworkers union leader as an example of Trump denying facts and lashing out at anyone who dares to call him out. He doesn t go to a fact-based argument, he goes to an emotion-base argument,  Bernstein pointed out.  What we have seen throughout the campaign is pathological disdain for the truth. Jeffrey Lord, of course, whined about Bernstein s analysis, but Berstein stood by what he said and doubled down. We now have a president-elect who, in terms of truthfulness Richard Nixon was nothing, in terms of lying, compared to what we have seen from Donald Trump. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is more unfit to be president than Richard Nixon. We could very well be looking at the most scandal-ridden administration in American history and it hasn t even taken over yet. At this rate, Trump might as well resign now before he becomes the first president to lose an impeachment trial.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Isn t that a huge conflict of interest, sir?  Wallace asked.Trump s response was that it was okay because everyone in the world knows he s a big real estate tycoon and he denied that he will be involved in the management of the company.To Wallace s credit (and I don t say that often), the Fox anchor countered that Trump  hammered Hillary Clinton over the Clinton Foundation and pay to play. Trump responded that that was  different because she takes massive amounts of money from foreign countries.  That s not true, but Fox didn t point that out.Wallace continued, noting that Trump will also be making  massive amounts of money  because  foreign countries are already booking events at the Trump hotel in D.C.,  and that Trump has  business operations, deals with foreign countries isn t this on steroids. Trump was seemingly appalled, but Wallace went on, saying that foreign governments were trying to curry favor with the United States through Trump s hotels.Trump, though, made the claim that he is  turning down billions of dollars in deals  because of potential conflicts of interest, but he did claim that he didn t know if he d be  doing deals,  and said that  under the law (he has) the right to do it,  but he doesn t want to.Here s the video:It s becoming increasingly clear that Trump is a danger, not just for domestic policy, but that he and his conflicts of interest present a real threat to the world. This issue is resonating with the American people, nearly 2/3rds of whom have expressed concern with Trump s conflicts of interest. As for why Fox is waking up to that reality now, and not before the election, well, perhaps they see it as their ticket out of a wildcard Trump presidency.

Ever since then, Trump and his team have been desperately defending Russia and insisting that Democrats made the whole thing up and that Russia would never interfere in our democratic system.During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Chris Wallace asked Trump about the Russian hacking. Trump responded by bragging about his victory and claimed that our intelligence agencies can t possibly know that Russia hacked anything. I think it s ridiculous,  Trump said.  I don t believe it. I don t know why and I think it s just   you know, they talked about all sorts of things. Every week it s another excuse. We had a massive landslide victory as you know in the electoral college. Hacking is very interesting,  Trump continued.  Once they hack, if you don t catch them in the act, you re not going to catch them. They have no idea if it s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace. Trump just demonstrated that he knows nothing about how technology works beyond how to use Twitter. Hacking leaves traces that experts can follow to identify the culprit. But instead of believing the experts, Trump tried to pin everything on the Democrats. I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country,  Trump claimed.  And frankly, I think they re putting it out. It s ridiculous. Trump went on to lecture that the CIA should blame other countries or individuals for the hack if they are going to report on what happened, but he couldn t end the interview without bragging again. We had   many people are saying   one of the great victories of all time. Here s the video via YouTube.First of all, Trump s  victory  is not even close to being one of greatest of all time. As it turns out, we keep the records of every presidential election and the records show that in the last 100 years alone, there are 18 elections in which a candidate did way better than Trump, including President Obama is 2008 and 2009. So it was NOT a  landslide  or a  mandate  like Trump imagines.Second, Trump is clearly denying the facts again, which is why Senator John McCain delivered the hard truth on Face The Nation.McCain said that he wants a bipartisan investigation by Congress to confirm the CIA assessment and he is totally bewildered by Trump s defense of Russia despite the evidence. I don t know what to make of it,  McCain said of Trump s claims.  Because it s clear the Russians interfered. Now whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate, I think that s a subject of investigation. Facts are stubborn things.

Supposedly, we used to be the perennial powerhouse of the entire world (like Duke, North Carolina or Arizona are perennial powerhouses of NCAA basketball), but we ve fallen from that status, and now we don t win anything like the number of games we used to.In other words, we used to be able to tell the world what they would do, and they would do it. Now they don t. So Trump promised our working class that he would change that, and bring their jobs back, and make us so prosperous that those jobs would never disappear again and everyone would be begging to trade with us so they could have a tiny slice of our awesomeness.Whether Trump actually knows the truth or not is anyone s guess. He s too focused on  winning.  And he s told our suffering working class particularly blue-collar workers whose jobs are disappearing that the reason their jobs are gone is because we ve given too much to countries that don t deserve our largesse or whatever. He s convinced half the country that the 45 percent tariff he wants on imported goods from China, and the 35 percent tariff on goods from Mexico, will keep companies from outsourcing manufacturing.And the people who bought that are the ones who will hurt the worst from Trump s actual trade policies.The Economist pointed this massive problem with Trump s rhetoric out with a single chart. We have free trade agreements not just with two countries, but with 20. Those 20 countries represent a third of our imported goods, yes, but they also represent half of our exported goods:Image via The EconomistExport is one of the major drivers of our economy, and our dear Mr. Trump conveniently forgets that part of the equation when he rails against China, Mexico, and everyone else.In the chart above, the dark blue, on both sides, represents our trade due to NAFTA. We do an awful lot of exports to both Mexico and Canada, in addition to imports. It s not quite equal, but it s also not so disparate that we re at the horrible disadvantage that Trump claims we are with NAFTA. Millions of American jobs actually depend heavily on NAFTA remaining intact.As far as China, yeah, we seem to be at a big disadvantage. However, it actually balances out pretty well when we factor in our trade with other countries. China isn t raping us the way that Trump claims they are.In short, when you look at imports versus exports, we re not getting robbed at nearly the rate that Trump would have us believe. To listen to him talk, we only import foreign goods and we export nothing. If that were true, then yes, our trade agreements would be destroying American jobs the way he claims. The problem with that attitude, though, is not only that it s false, but it also shows that Trump s protectionist policies will destroy American exports and thus, American jobs.That, in turn, will further destroy the American working class   the very class that believes Trump will save them, their jobs, and their dignity from the evil, horrible, liberal Democrats that want to assassinate them. We wish these people knew how to look at this, but they don t. They re virtually killing themselves in their blindly staunch defense of Trump because they either can t, or won t, educate themselves.Education is for liberal elites anyway, so they shun it.Do we import more than we export? Yes. But imagine if some countries decided to stop accepting our products in retaliation for our not accepting theirs without a huge penalty attached. Our exports would fall off drastically, and thousands more Americans would lose their jobs, even with Trump s one-by-one coercion of companies looking to outsource.Seriously, Trump does not seem to understand any of this. We have a fucking president who doesn t get this and won t listen to the people who do because he thinks he s this amazing business genius and everyone else is just jealous, or something.He doesn t have to listen to anyone because he already knows everything, in other words.If he starts a trade war, which is what his trade policies would do should they actually be implemented, the working class he s claiming to protect will die an even more horribly painful death as countries retaliate against us for our unfair trade tactics.The global economy is far more complex than Trump and his idiotic, entitled, hypocritical, privileged, rich family and friends understand. We can t just implement protectionist policies, bring back those millions of lost manufacturing jobs, and give the world the finger. It does not work that way. It will never again work that way.

In fact, so far he s only shown plans for the exact opposite.Many Americans believe there s too many people on welfare, but when they make only eight dollars an hour, how else are they supposed to get by? Meanwhile, more often than not, their CEOs make in an hour what they make in a year. Sadly this is likely to remain unchanged, or get even worse with our new Secretary of Labor.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Virtually all the emails they released publically were potentially damaging to Clinton and the Democrats, the official told Reuters. That was a major clue to their intent,  the official said.  If all they wanted to do was discredit our political system, why publicize the failings of just one party, especially when they have a target like Trump? Trump has nominated a Secretary of State candidate, Rex Tillerman, who is a friend to Russia and Vladimir Putin. This is not a coincidence, nor is it a surprise. He has nominated a would-be National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, an ally to Russia and spreader of fake news. This also is not a coincidence. This is the reality of the United States, post-Obama.No, this was not some 400 pound guy in his parent s basement, as Trump would suggest. This is a world power that has their hands in several world crises   Syria, Ukraine and so forth.So while Republicans   and indeed left-wing defectors from the Democratic Party   hyper focused on the Clinton/Podesta emails, Trump was on the cusp of a victory thanks in part to Russian hackings   which may even extend to voter hackings in November.The Russians may or may not have physically intervened on November 8th to help Donald Trump win. However, it has now been proven by 17 security agencies, both private and governmental   that Russia played a key role in souring the public s perception about Clinton and the Democrats.It wasn t just because of hackings. The Kremlin paid and trained trolls to flood the internet with fake news and multiple Twitter/Facebook accounts to create a world of hate for Hillary Clinton, a world of praise for Donald Trump.Luckily, Republicans like John McCain and Lindsey Graham are starting to see the big picture, but its not enough. They, along with their conservative colleagues and liberal adversaries, were A-OK with smearing Clinton with Russian propagated lies if it meant having an R in the White House.When it comes to Donald Trump and Russia, we Democrats hate to say it, but, we told you so.

Trump picked Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his nominee, a man who has strong ties to Russia.Watch:The following year after Tillerson negotiated an energy partnership with Putin in 2011, the Exxon CEO received the Russian Order of Friendship, one of the highest awards the country bestows upon foreign nationals. The deal he made with Russia had been put on hold due to sanctions levied against the Kremlin for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. However, ExxonMobil said the company intends to resume the deal after sanctions are lifted. As Secretary of State, Tillerson could help expedite that process.During the recount in Wisconsin, City of Ashland Cyber Security Consultant Eric Ellason and Bayfield County Director of Information Technology Paul Houck said that both municipalities have seen an unusual amount of traffic coming to their sites from Russia.Trump is filling up the swamp quickly and it s starting to have a Russian accent.Our election process was hacked.

Not only does Tillerson and Big Oil stand to profit mightily from closer ties with Russia, Tillerson is a close friend of Putin and will likely treat Russia in a way that goes entirely against American interests and security.According to the New York Times,Mr. Tillerson has worked to strengthen Exxon Mobil s ties with Russia.

At the time, the White House had been looking for broad, bipartisan support from Congressional leaders in coming out with the information. They were worried about looking like they were, in fact, playing politics.McConnell, however, decided to threaten the White House with that accusation regardless: The Democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously. Republicans, however, were divided, with at least two GOP lawmakers reluctant to accede to the White House requests.According to several officials, McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics. He did not want this information getting out, although why is anybody s guess. We know that the RNC was hacked as well, but whatever those hacks discovered was never released: We now have high confidence that they hacked the D.N.C. and the R.N.C., and conspicuously released no documents  from the Republican organization, one senior administration official said, referring to the Russians. Why? It raises all sorts of questions, including whether McConnell had an idea about that and was afraid of the GOP looking like they were actively working with Russia to secure a Trump presidency.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Russian interference in our election should immediately disqualify Donald Trump from the presidency.On Friday, a CIA assessment found that the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies and officials is that Russia hacked our election system to not only hurt American confidence in our democratic institutions but to help Trump win against Hillary Clinton.According to the Washington Post,The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton s chances.This, of course, is a huge blow to Trump s legitimacy because he and his transition team have been strenuously insisting that Trump won by historic margins and that the country needs to unite behind him and kiss his ass. Now we know why.In response to the CIA report, Trump s team issued what amounts to a  nothing to see here, move along  statement, all while throwing intelligence officials under the bus. These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It s now time to move on and  Make America Great Again. In fact, most intelligence officials and agencies warned President Bush that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. So Trump just pushed a Bush Administration lie in order to hurt the credibility of our intelligence agencies.Also, Trump s  victory  is hardly one of the biggest in history. This is merely Trump trying to convince everyone that he s legitimate by exaggerating his election performance. The only problem is that we have the records from past elections. All of them. In just the last century alone, 18 other presidential election victories are bigger than Donald Trump s. That includes President Obama s victories in 2008 and 2012.Furthermore, Hillary Clinton is winning the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which Trump is desperately trying to undermine by claiming that 3 million people voted illegally.Evidence of Russian hacking is what originally caused activists to call for recounts late last month in three battleground states, including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. A recount in underway in Wisconsin while courts are preventing them in the other two as Green Party candidate Jill Stein continues to fight for election integrity.Now that our intelligence services have concluded that Russia DID hack our election in an effort to help Trump steal the election, it is more important than ever to make sure these recounts happen. In fact, they should happen in every state. Until then, Donald Trump should be considered an illegitimate president-elect.The fact that Trump and his team have been desperately trying to kill these recount effort is even more suspicious and gives the appearance that they are trying to hide something or prevent something from being discovered.Let s also not forget that Donald Trump himself encouraged Russia to continue hacking American institutions for his benefit. And they obeyed his request.This is a serious moment for our democracy. Allowing Trump to take office while ignoring the evidence that he cheated to win will only irrevocably damage American confidence in the integrity of our elections it will set a dangerous precedent. If Trump is allowed to get away with being aided by foreign agents, nothing stops Republicans or even Democrats from employing the same strategy in future elections. This needs to be stopped now before it it too late and the only way to do that is to stop Donald Trump from taking office and declaring Hillary Clinton the true victor.Impossible, you say? Not so fast. As it turns out, there is precedent for installing a defeated candidate when evidence of fraud is found. Huffington Post notes that a state Senate race in Pennsylvania was overturned and awarded to Republican Bruce Marks over Democrat William Stinson after real evidence of voter fraud was brought to light.Two of the elected officials who testified in the Pennsylvania case said under oath that they were aware of the fraud, had intentionally failed to enforce laws, and hurried to certify Stinson the winner in order to bury the story. The narrative recalls the Washington Post s revelation that Republican Mitch McConnell was aware of the CIA s conclusion that Russians had intervened and opted to do nothing.In the end, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court order that Marks be sworn in to fill the Senate seat.So not only could the courts restore election integrity by ordering Trump to step aside, they can install Hillary Clinton as the true President of the United States by citing Russian interference in the election. The Electoral College could intervene as well by not voting for Donald Trump on December 19th. They should vote for Clinton instead.The bottom line is that Donald Trump had outside help, which means he owes Russian a huge favor should he be allowed to take office. Russia would own him and that puts our nation at serious risk. Russian interference makes Trump illegitimate and he should be disqualified from holding office. If we really care about our democracy, this is what needs to be done.Featured Image: Mark Makela/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It would return America to a time when insurance companies could deny people coverage because of pre-existing conditions, which would hurt women most since insurance companies consider being female a pre-existing condition. It would also reverse the ability of children to remain on their parents  insurance until the age of 26 and give insurance companies the power to raise costs like never before.Millions of Americans across the nation, especially those in red states would lose their healthcare coverage, causing the uninsured rate to skyrocket back to historic levels.Repeal would punish Americans simply for getting access to healthcare coverage.But repeal would be a windfall for the wealthy.That s right. Republicans are going to take healthcare away from Americans and give the rich a massive tax cut at the same time.According to Talking Points Memo,Two taxes that will be presumably axed with the law affect only those making $200,000 or more. The break the ACA repeal will bring to those taxpayers will amount to a $346 billion tax cut in total over 10 years, according to the CBO report on the 2015 repeal legislation GOP lawmakers say they ll be using as their model next year.These taxes help cover the subsidies many Americans received in order to help them afford a healthcare plan. But if Obamacare is repealed, those subsidies will be eliminated and will serve as a tax hike on the poor and middle class.This is how Republicans are going to begin 2017. They are literally going to prevent Americans from affording healthcare while giving even MORE money to greedy people who don t need it.On top of all this, Republicans are aiming to phase out Medicare by privatizing it and turning it into a worthless voucher system and have introduced legislation to slash Social Security.In short, Republicans are planning to break the back of the middle class and screw over the working class once and for all.

It s an almost-standard part of Republican rhetoric to ignore the lopsided vote among this key set of Americans instead of denigrating the choices this group of citizens has made at the ballot box.During the campaign, Trump also generated a backlash among black voters, describing the black community as crime-ridden and uneducated, while telling black voters they had  nothing to lose  by voting for him. A vast majority of them evidently rejected his message, perhaps in large part coming from his decision to woo white supremacist support while also supporting the racist birther conspiracy against President Obama.While Clinton did not get as strong a turnout with black voters as Obama did, she earned enough of their vote to end up with a popular vote victory over Trump, leading him by 2.7 million votes and making him the second Republican in 20 years to win the presidency without getting most of the votes.Perhaps if Trump was less flippant or dismissive with black voters, his party would be competitive in that arena instead of the constant routs.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

According to the New York Times, the Republican National Committee was also hacked. But Russia chose not to release the data they retrieved from the RNC hacks. This is part of the reason intelligence agencies are so certain there was a specific agenda behind Russia s actions, namely to put Trump in the White House.The Times reports:American intelligence agencies have concluded with  high confidence  that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton s chances and promote Donald J. Trump, according to senior administration officials.They based that conclusion, in part, on another finding   which they say was also reached with high confidence   that the Russians hacked the Republican National Committee s computer systems in addition to their attacks on Democratic organizations, but did not release whatever information they gleaned from the Republican networks.Republicans insist that even though Russia may have tried to hack into their systems, these attempts were unsuccessful. However, one senior administration official said that American intelligence agencies  now have high confidence that they hacked the D.N.C. and the R.N.C., and conspicuously released no documents  from the Republican committee.Intelligence experts have reason to believe that the same hackers who penetrated the DNC also succeeded in breaching the RNC.The revelation that the RNC was also hacked by the Russians comes after a day of bombshells related to the country s meddling in the U.S. election. Friday began with Trump s fellow Republicans announcing plans to probe Russia s involvement with the hack. Not long after, President Obama ordered an investigation into Russia s interference in the election, which he wants to have completed before he leaves office in January.It was also revealed that a secret CIA assessment had confirmed that not only did Russia meddle in our presidential election, but that they did so to help Trump win. It now appears that part of the information intelligence experts used to come to this conclusion was Russia s choice not to release the data they obtained from hacking the Republicans.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

What they re busy doing, while keeping things humming along, is another story entirely. Trump s pick for head of the Environmental Protection Agency is enough to send alarm bells ringing, but then his transition team had to go and make things considerably worse.Trump s team has contacted the Department of Energy with some unusual requests that would worry pretty much anyone. They want to know who had attended the U.N. s climate summits over the last five years. As we all know, there was a major climate change summit in Paris at the end of 2015, and we eventually ended up signing onto the agreement that emerged, much to the dismay of climate deniers who want to derail all the progress we ve made as a global climate leader.Their questionnaire, which has 74 questions (more than many tests, employment exams, etc.), also asked who had attended any meetings on the social cost of carbon, which is what our government uses to determine the costs and benefits of new climate and energy regulations. They also want a list of all publications from employees who are at the 17 national laboratories run by the Dept. of Energy for the last three years. Dan Reicher, a professor at Stanford University, said: They re certainly sending an aggressive signal here with some of these questions and they need to be careful. Yeah well, Trump and his cronies, his lapdogs, and the people who are giving him blow jobs and sucking his balls don t really want to be careful. They want to prove they re on Cheetolini s side. Why? Likely because Trump is a massive climate denier, regardless of what he says now, and because everyone he s choosing to run the agencies in charge of both energy production and environmental protection are avid climate deniers.If you re not a climate denier, good luck keeping your job. Trump and his cabinet picks could undo every environmental regulation we ve implemented in the last, well, who knows? 20 years? 30? The people who oppose that, and the people who are just dying to sleep with King Cheeto, would rather perform fellatio than stick by the truth of climate change.Some employees at the Dept. of Energy feel like this is an  enemies list,  of sorts: When Donald Trump said he wanted to drain the swamp it apparently was just to make room for witch hunts and it s starting here at the DOE and our 17 national labs. Yup. Most likely. Energy and environmental policy are good places to start since not many people really think about those things. Care? Absolutely, but not think about on a daily basis, which is sad considering the fact that we still need this planet to survive, and if it changes faster than we can adapt, we ll all die.But who cares about that, right? Climate change is always happening, and it s not man-made because man can t be so arrogant as to thwart the Almighty Christian God, so trying to save the environment is dumb since businesses need profit and man will either survive or die anyway.Or that s how they sound.Anyway.The Dept. of Energy should be afraid because they might be the start of a government-wide purging of people who don t agree with every single syllable Trump utters, either in front of a mic or on his Twitter account.

They have total control over him just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton,  Trump said, claiming that he doesn t need money from Goldman Sachs and that doesn t want it, therefore, Goldman Sachs has  no control  over him. He railed against Goldman Sachs,  Todd told Conway.  Three Goldman Sachs alums. Fairly prominent positions. How is that not hypocritical? Of course, Conway tried to spin in defense of Trump. He railed against their political influence,  Conway said, which doesn t really make sense since Trump literally just gave three Goldman Sachs executives tremendous political influence.Nevertheless, Conway claimed that they  don t have influence over him politically and they will not have influence over him politically in the White House. However, Trump has said that Goldman Sachs  owns  Ted Cruz because he took loans from them. But that logic backfired because it turns out Trump has also taken loans from Goldman Sachs, which according to Trump means they own him. And now three of them are in Trump s cabinet.Todd once again cornered Conway and demanded answers.First, he wanted to know how she would react if Hillary Clinton had won and appointed three Goldman Sachs alums. She claimed that she wouldn t have whined about but we all know Trump and all of his supporters would be throwing a collective temper tantrum.The Todd wondered,  Was the trashing of Goldman just simply campaign rhetoric and sort of B.S.? The answer is yes but Conway again went with the whole  he was just talking about political influence  line, and Todd refused to let Conway get away with that bullshit. Those are political appointments!  Todd exclaimed.But the facts don t matter to team Trump, and Conway simply kept talking and talking and talking to run out the clock and force Todd to move one to the next topic.Here s the video via YouTube.Once again, Donald Trump gets caught being a complete hypocrite and his team spews bullshit to defend him.

That means anybody who is on Medicare or hoped to be on it soon are shit out of luck because Ryan s plan gives Medicare to private insurance companies, which means higher costs to get insurance and paying more for healthcare, even if the government offers pathetic vouchers to help pay for it.But now Republicans have unveiled their plan to cut Social Security as well.On Thursday, GOP Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas introduced the Social Security Reform Act of 2016 or H.R. 6489.The bill claims to be  saving  Social Security even though it is fully solvent through 2034 and could be infinitely solvent by applying the payroll tax to all income over $100,000. Republicans, however, like to complicate things and punish Americans at the same time.The most important part of the Republican plan is that they intend to raise retirement age from 67 to 69 for anyone who is 49 or younger. The GOP cites longer life expectancy as their reason for this change. In fact, life expectancy actually dropped in this country for the first time since 1993.So this is really all about screwing Americans out of their Social Security longer by making them work longer. Let s call it the GOP s  work till you drop dead  plan.The Republican plan will also slow the growth of benefits by basically changing the inflation metric so that benefits do not keep up with inflation, which means the cost of living will go up, but Social Security benefits won t.Furthermore, Republicans want to eliminate taxes on income after retirement, which would only take away from Social Security revenues.And that doesn t mean Republicans have given up the idea of privatizing Social Security. After all, President Bush wanted to do exactly that. He didn t get to, but had he been successful Social Security would have been wiped out by the Great Recession in 2008.Donald Trump promised his supporters that Social Security and Medicare would not be touched if he was elected. But apparently they got duped again just like he has been duping them about everything else, and they are about to pay a hefty price for it. Republicans DO NOT care about the American people.

And the first victims of the Republicans newfound power? Coal miners.Yes, coal miners, the very people that represent the backbone of manual labor in the United States. From the hills of West Virginia all the way down to Kentucky, coal miners are what keeps America s energy bills under control and our electricity efficient. Democrats (like Hillary Clinton) lost big in coal country because of a  failure  to  connect with them (even though she was the only candidate to offer them alternative programs to the dying industry). Trump and the Republicans pounced, promising them revitalization and a basket of goodies to make them great again.And now the United States may face a looming shutdown because of them. Why? Republicans don t want to pay their healthcare and pension plans.That s right, the same people who promised to be their champions are now turning their backs.Labeling the plan a  bailout,  Republicans are stonewalling Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who offered an amendment to the chief funding bill of the United States government that will revitalize the United Mine Workers  health and pension system, which went broke because of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.If Republicans continue to block the legislation   which would lead to a shutdown   over 16,000 retired coal miners and their families will lose their healthcare and pension plans. Manchin s amendment would offer temporary assistance until April 28 when another budget would have to be considered. Working with Manchin is West Virginia s other Senator, Republican Shelly Moore-Capito and Democrat Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also supports the amendment being added but blocked it from consideration last year.McConnell, however, has asked that Democrats step aside and not block the continuing resolution over the miner s benefits.Aside from Moore-Capito and Mitch McConnell, no Republicans have expressed support for the measure, and the opponents have called it a  government bailout  that sets a precedent to  bail out  other troubled pension systems and healthcare benefits.If Republicans want to see what a precedent looks like, they should ask Trump about his Carrier deal.So Democrats are accused of turning their backs on the working class. Meanwhile, Democrats Joe Manchin and Sherrod Brown are spearheading an amendment that helps that very class of workers, and Republicans are slamming it as a  government bailout.  If Republicans don t get Manchin, Moore-Capito and Brown on board with a continuing resolution, it won t pass.So bankers can get a trillion dollars in tax payer bailouts, but coal miners, who were promised their pensions and healthcare and who power our country, get squat and demonized?Democrats have been, are, and will be for the working class. They may not be as theatrical and slick as Republicans, but let today s example show who really has the back of the working class.

She chaired the powerful Appropriations Committee, becoming a ranking member. Coining the term  Macaroni and cheese economics,  Mikulski worked tirelessly for working families, children, women, and veterans, who too often fell prey and victim to a system that was rigged against the little guys.Harry ReidSenator Reid, who entered the United States Congress in 1983 and the Senate in 1987, bringing with him a unique and humbling story of hope, handwork and perseverance.

These Senators will be missed greatly, and their legacies will live on long after they leave their seats.

For some reason, millions of people in Europe and America have forgotten about what white nationalists have done in the not-so-distant past. Jews were the ones being persecuted during World War II. Muslims are the ones being persecuted now. And fascism is once again poised to destroy democracy. The only question is who is going to stand up and fight against it if the governments and military forces of the free world are dominated by evil?While we may not necessarily agree with what Soral did, at least he had the courage to fight a white nationalist in defense of human rights. After all, white nationalists have been committing hate crimes and killing people for decades.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

We may have crossed into a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after-action, to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,  she said.She added that Obama wants the report completed before Donald Trump takes over on Jan. 20.The intelligence community placed the blame for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic Party groups on Russia clear back in October. Emails obtained in the hack, some of which appeared to be damaging to Hillary Clinton, were placed on Wikileaks.A statement released by intelligence experts said the leaks were consistent  with Russian tactics. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,  the statement said.According to Monaco, Obama instructed the intelligence community to identify  lessons learned and report to a range of stakeholders,  including lawmakers.On Friday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that Trump s bromance with Putin has created an  added urgency. Given President-elect Trump s disturbing refusal to listen to our intelligence community and accept that the hacking was orchestrated by the Kremlin, there is an added urgency to the need for a thorough review before President Obama leaves office next month. Even Trump s own party is giving him the middle finger when it comes to Putin and announced on Friday that they are preparing to launch a wide-ranging probe into Russia s involvement with the DNC hack and their meddling in the presidential election.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Going against the incoming administration, several Republicans are preparing to launch a wide-ranging investigation into Russia, particularly their involvement with hacking and alleged interference in the presidential election.The Washington Post reported:Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (Ariz.) is readying a probe of possible Russian cyber-incursions into U.S. weapons systems, and he said he has been discussing the issue with Senate Select Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (N.C.), with whom he will be  working closely  to investigate Russia s suspected interference in the U.S. elections and cyberthreats to the military and other institutions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been apprised of the discussions. Burr did not respond to requests for comment.Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) also said he intends to hold hearings next year into alleged Russian hacking. Corker is on Trump s shortlist for secretary of state, according to the Trump transition team.Two of the most vocal voices on team Probe Putin are McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham.Graham said that Russia will  keep doing more here until they pay a price.  Next year, he plans to head up legislation and hold investigative hearings on  Russia s misadventures throughout the world,  which will absolutely include Russian interference in the U.S. election. I m going after Russia in every way you can go after Russia. I think they re one of the most destabilizing influences on the world stage. I think they did interfere with our elections, and I want Putin personally to pay the price,  Graham told CNN on Wednesday.McCain said his Armed Services Committee is going to be investigating Russia s cyber capabilities and the extent that they could be used against the U.S. military and our weapons systems,  because the real threat is cyber.  McCain added that this investigation will probably veer off to include looking at the possibility Russia was behind the DNC hacking. Also on the list to be probed is the hacking of state-based election systems, including that of Arizona, McCain s home state. See, the problem with hacking is that if they re able to disrupt elections, then it s a national security issue, obviously,  McCain said on Thursday.He noted that the Armed Services Committee was  still formulating  just exactly how they would go about dealing with the issue, but said   there s very little doubt  that Russia was meddling in the U.S. election process, which he insists is very worthy of examination. Trump has dismissed the possibility that Russia was responsible for the DNC hacking, despite the fact that he himself called on the country to find  Hillary Clinton s missing emails. I don t believe they interfered,  Trump said.  It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey. I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals. Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images and Thierry Chesnot/Getty Images.

Between lying through his teeth about what the deal entailed, then unleashing multiple Twitter rants targeting Carrier s union president when he was called out on it, his behavior has not been what most would consider presidential, to say the least!Thursday night, during his segment  A Closer Look,  Seth Meyers took the opportunity to dig deep into the deceptive Carrier deal and discovered that hardly any of what Trump is bragging about adds up. So Trump first claimed he would stop Carrier from moving jobs to Mexico, then claimed he was saving over 1,100 jobs and then it turned out he was saving only 730 which The Washington Post reports is just 37 percent of the total who were due to leave the state. Meyers points out that while saving those 730 jobs is likely a big relief to the families of those workers, it isn t nearly good enough compared to what was promised   and to add to that, the hypocrisy from the right regarding this so-called deal is astounding! Despite its many flaws, there s no denying the deal was politically popular. But for Republicans, what s so surprising about this new policy of strong-arming companies into making business decisions is that the GOP has spent eight years calling Obama a  socialist  for his economic policies. Remember how they reacted to the auto bailout, which saved as many as 1.5 million jobs  They accused him of coercion and hijacking capitalism.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Trump mouthpiece Kayleigh McEnany attacked former Labor Secretary Robert Reich on Thursday night and quickly discovered that she was out of her depth.While CNN awaited Donald Trump s appearance at a rally, Anderson Cooper turned to Reich for his thoughts on Trump conflicts of interest and his cabinet selections.Reich slammed Trump s picks, pointing out that he has chosen people to run departments that they want to destroy. For instance, Jeff Sessions has been chosen to run the Department of Justice and he s an opponent of civil rights and the Voting Right Act. Betsy DeVos hates public education and she has been chosen to run the Education Department. And Andrew Puzder was recently chosen to run the Labor Department even though he is hostile towards workers and opposes minimum wage, overtime pay, and basic labor regulations.Well, of course, Kayleigh McEnany threw a hissy fit about what Reich said and she proceeded to attack him and offer a pathetic defense of Trump s choices. I just want to quickly say to Secretary Reich, I thought it was really unfair the way you characterize the cabinet picks,  she began.  You know Jeff Sessions is a great guy. He s not against the Voting Rights Act. But that s not true. Jeff Sessions is, in fact, against the Voting Rights Act. He has often claimed that its provisions are unconstitutional and actually cheered when the Supreme Court gutted a key piece of it in 2013.And then McEnany defended Trump s Labor pick. I think the pick today, Mr. Puzder, is a guy who his employees have said he cares about the cashier the same way he cares about the business owners,  McEnany said.  I think it s really unfair to characterize him that way. She continued to defend Puzder by noting that he only opposes the federal minimum wage, which really doesn t help since without federal minimum wage many red states would set their already low wages even lower. She then accused Reich of attacking Puzder just because he s a conservative. Just because he s conservative, it doesn t mean he s anti-worker,  she whined.But Reich was prepared for such bullshit and promptly ripped McEnany a new one. I m not saying he s anti-worker because he s conservative,  Reich replied. I m saying he s anti-worker because he s anti-worker. The Department of Labor came into his restaurants and found that half his restaurants had wage and labor violations that violated the law of the United States. You think that s pro-worker? You think it s pro-worker that his weekly paycheck equals the average yearly paycheck of his workers and he s against a minimum wage increase? You think that is pro-worker? I m sorry I ve never heard of that. McEnany then resorted to accusing Reich of being a socialist and claimed that Puzder is qualified because he s a rich fast food CEO. Of course, she doesn t mention that he s a staunch opponent of the  Fight for $15,  a movement by fast food workers to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. In other words, he has a conflict of interest because by taking the Labor Secretary job he can destroy the drive for fair wages that his own employees are part of.And Reich called McEnany out for it. But why should they be Secretary of Labor when they are in charge of enforcing the labor laws and they have a record of not even obeying the labor laws?  he asked.McEnany then spouted bullshit about how trickle-down will work because it worked in the 1980s, which forced Reich to shut her down. It did not work in the 1980s,  Reich forcefully declared.  Wages were flat The median wage started to flatten and decline. And that s because we had a president who believe in supply-side trickle-down economics and nothing trickled down Nothing nothing trickled down to typical workers. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, the only people who saw gains because of Reagan s policies were the wealthy. And his economic policies are still punishing Americans to this day and all Republicans want to do is double down on them like they did in Kansas, and as we all know, Kansas  economy has imploded.The next time McEnany thinks about attacking a former Labor Secretary who was also a former Harvard professor and current professor at the University of California at Berkeley, she should just keep her mouth shut. She won t embarrass herself that way.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The partisan gap in ratings of the job Trump has done so far is wider than it has been for any prospective president dating to the 1988 election. Further: Trump also receives low marks for his initial cabinet choices and other high level appointments. By 51% to 40%, more say they disapprove than approve of the cabinet choices and appointments Trump has made so far. In contrast, majorities approved of the choices made by the past four president-elects.

However, those headlines have been hiding a sinister fact that everyone should be aware of: the McMahons are major funders of Trump. They ve given the Trump Foundation and Super PACs supporting the candidate millions of dollars. A donor is being given a spot on the incoming administration.Here s more, from The New Civil Rights Movement:Donald Trump has named former WWE CEO Linda McMahon to become his Small Business Administration chief. McMahon gave a Trump Super PAC $6 million during the final months of the campaign, despite having denounced his comments about women as  deplorable. McMahon, who ran for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut but failed, twice, is the top outside donor (along with her husband) to the Trump Foundation, giving the controversial family charity $5 million between 2007 and 2009  more than Trump himself gave.Apparently, she s totally fine with Trump s comments as long as she gets to buy a spot on his administration.As Trump said when speaking about the Clinton Foundation,  Follow the money.  If she s not buying a position in the administration, why would you appoint someone who has donated over $10 million to support you? After all, the appearance of impropriety and impropriety itself are often not far separate in public life, where perception can be everything. It s very obvious that Donald Trump is either corrupt, or doesn t care if people think he s corrupt. And considering his settlement for fraud, thousands of stiffed contractors, thousands upon thousands of lawsuits, and general business record, it seems most likely it s the former option.Can you imagine the level of scrutiny Hillary Clinton would have faced if she appointed someone to her hypothetical administration who had donated over $10 million to her? Conservatives would be frothing at the mouth   and rightfully so, in that case. Pay-to-play is simply not the way a government should be run. Of course, since it s Trump, conservatives are silent.Plus, she s not even qualified:Like many of the President-elect s cabinet appointments, McMahon s professional qualifications appear to be out-of-step with the duties she will assume when she is confirmed. Despite her family s entrepreneurial streak, the WWE has a near monopolization over the industry and has been accused of allegedly prioritizing money over the health of its wrestlers.  We of course had a responsibility to our shareholders,  McMahon told the Times in response, denying the allegations.  But every good chief executive understands that in addition to maintaining profitability, companies that hope to be successful in the long term absolutely have to put people first.  Whether McMahon will be able to use her experience with big business to benefit small businesses around America has yet to be seen.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""It s the lame duck session for Ohio s legislature, which means they re going bananas pushing  Christmas tree  bills   and measures added to bills   through before their term ends. This process tends to favor the majority party, which is the Republican Party, and they ve already made headlines for two unconstitutionally restrictive anti-abortion bills, as well as an aptly-named  guns everywhere  bill.And that s still not enough for Ohio Republicans. In their latest act of legislative war, they ve taken aim at labor and local democracy. How? By adding a measure banning local municipalities from raising the minimum wage to a bill against bestiality, of all things. Governor Kasich has not yet stated whether or not he will sign, but Republican legislators are optimistic.It should be noted that an anti-bestiality bill passed the Ohio Senate with bipartisan support earlier in the term.This measure appears mostly aimed at the city of Cleveland, which is about to vote on whether to raise the minimum wage locally to $15 over the next few years. A local group in Cincinnati, Cincinnatians for a Strong Economy, wants to do the same.Republicans generally claim to be in favor of local government   after all, who knows the needs of a given city or state better than the people that live there? However, incidents like this have made it clear that individual matters of ideological concern trump  principles  every time in the GOP.It should be noted that this is merely coming from a place of ideological support and politics   there is absolutely no evidence that banning cities from raising the minimum wage is good for the economy. See, until 2012, only five local districts in the entire country had minimum wage laws. Since then, dozens more have followed suit, allowing for numerous case studies on whether or not a local minimum wage raise  kills jobs,  as Republicans claim, as opposed to accomplishing that dastardly progressive agenda of keeping workers out of poverty.In many cases, large cities   which typically have higher cost-to-live and unique economic considerations   are a better choice for a minimum wage raise than an entire state, anyway. Take Seattle, for example, which saw the nation s first $15 minimum wage law (although San Francisco will get there faster):As one of my colleagues wrote last week, the  unemployment rate in the city of Seattle   the tip of the spear when it comes to minimum wage experiments   has now hit a new cycle low of 3.4%.  Meanwhile, a University of Washington study on the minimum wage law found little or no evidence of job losses or business closings.Although you can never declare a game over until the final whistle, this experiment is starting to look like a rout. I continue to believe that we should assess the data as it comes in, honestly and as free of bias as possible. This is a complex issue   Seattle, with its vibrant tech industry, high median household income and growing population, is different from many U.S. cities. States and cities must adjust their minimum wages to fit their local conditions; this is why a national minimum wage should rise at a pace different from the most economically vibrant locales.Taking away the ability of local cities to determine their own economic needs is bad policy, and allowing state officials to interfere in municipal democracy is undemocratic. Not only that, but workers deserve a raise. Minimum wage nationally is $7.25, frequently referred to as  poverty wages,  and the minimum wage in Ohio   $8.10   is not much higher. Republicans who are against welfare for human beings seem to have no trouble picking up the tab for deadbeat businesses that refuse to pay workers their fair share.From QZ:It could be that the fears of minimum wage opponents are overstated. One innovative 2015 study examined prices at online menus from local restaurants in San Jose, California, after the city enacted a 25% increase in minimum wages, and found that restaurants were able to accommodate higher costs of doing business through minor price increases. By looking at restaurants within a half-mile of the city s border, they were also able to demonstrate results  challenging the suggestion that local minimum wages disadvantage a city s economic competitiveness.  These experiments, however, have benefitted from the steady growth of the Obama economy, with its record 72 months of labor market expansion.With Donald Trump s presidency on the horizon, Democrats locked out of national influence will no doubt continue to press a progressive agenda locally, in the cities and states where they have more sway. But as wage floors rise, especially in jurisdictions with older or shrinking populations, they will have to be pragmatic about overreach, keeping in mind the lesson of Kansas  Republican governor Sam Brownback, who enacted a radical agenda in his state as an example to the nation a conservative one, rather than a progressive one, it should be noted and saw the local economy crumble.It s just a fact   liberals are better at managing the economy. That s what history and the facts show. This is undemocratic and anti-labor   in other words, everything the GOP stands for.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

However, Trump inflated the numbers, and, worst of all, left out the problematic nature of the deal, which included $7 million in tax cuts for the company in exchange for keeping the jobs in the United States.Chuck Jones, the leader of the union for the workers at that Indiana plant, said that Trump, quote,  lied his ass off, about the deal, including the number of jobs saved. Well, this led Trump to attack Jones via Twitter, and voila! A new Trump feud is born. Now, as if it weren t bad enough that Trump himself is acting like a spoiled child rather than the president-elect, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer is also joining in the dog piling on Jones. On Thursday, Spicer went on Fox News and said the following of Jones: He should be grateful for Mr. Trump and [Republican Indiana] Gov. [Mike] Pence s efforts to save those jobs. Here you have a guy that talked about Carrier and the importance of keeping jobs. He picks up the phone and closes a deal. You ve got a 1,000 people that are going to have a blessed holiday season that are not worried about jobs. They get to spend this time with family and friends knowing that they have a job with good benefits. That s something that should be celebrated. No, Trump s lies should not be celebrated, Mr. Spicer. Were SOME jobs saved? Sure. But the method by which they were saved is not a sustainable one, and it is costing Indiana taxpayers   you know, the folks Trump keeps promising to help   millions. Further, it s not Chuck Jones who lied. It s Donald Trump. Splicer insisted that it was Jones lying about Trump, though: And then you ve got a union boss that goes out and fabricates how the story went down for no reason. I think Mr. Trump is never going to sit back and let someone take a shot falsely at him without responding. This is the problem with Trump cronies and mouthpieces.

Some CEOs even make more than 100 times what their employees make. And some of those CEOs have the gall to whine that providing benefits, better wages, and healthcare to their employees is a waste of money.Well, if these greedy CEOs want to operate in Portland they ll have to pay an extra tax that could inspire other American cities to do the same thing.According to the Institute for Policy Studies,In a 3-1 vote, the council agreed to add a surtax on the city s existing business license tax for firms that pay their CEOs more than 100 times what their typical worker receives. This will be the nation s first tax penalty for extreme CEO-worker pay gaps.On how the tax will be levied and which companies will be affected, Truthout.org spoke to IPS co-editor Sarah Anderson, who explained that the city has already found over 500 companies that will see a rise in their taxes soon.Publicly traded companies with extreme pay gaps will pay a surtax on top of the city s current business license tax. The surtax will be 10 percent of the business tax liability for companies with a CEO-worker pay ratio of more than 100-to-1 and 25 percent for companies with a ratio of more than 250-to-1. The Portland government has identified more than 500 corporations that do enough business in the city to be affected by the surtax, including many that regularly dominate the highest-paid CEO lists, such as Oracle, Honeywell, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and General Electric.So once again, the fight on behalf of workers is centered in Oregon. Earlier this year, Oregon raised the minimum wage to nearly $15 an hour. Meanwhile, Donald Trump s cabinet is stacked with billionaires and his tax plan favors the top one percent.According to a Tax Policy Center chart posted to Twitter by Morning Joe economic wonk Steven Rattner, Trump s tax plan will give the top 0.1 percent a $1.1 million tax cut while the bottom 20 percent only get a cut of $110.Under Trump s plan, the top 0.1% get an avg tax cut of $1.1mm; the bottom 20% get only $110.

Why is our country over? Because of Donald Trump.Galtung has been predicting the demise of the U.S. as a superpower since 2000. Back then, he said it would come in 2025. That was before George W. Bush took office, though. That presidency sped up the inevitable, according to Galtung, by five years. Trump s election is going to speed it up even more.He told Motherboard the election of Mr. Trump  speeds up the decline , although he qualified the statement, saying:  Of course, what he does as a President remains to be seen. Source: IndependentOne of the pressing issues with Trump is his nationalism, and in particular, his hostility toward NATO. The collapse has two faces,  Dr Galtung told the tech news site,  Other countries refuse to be good allies and the USA has to do the killing themselves, by bombing from high altitudes, drones steered by computer from an office, special forces killing all over the place. Both are happening today, except for Northern Europe, which supports these wars, for now. That will probably not continue beyond 2020, so I stand by that deadline. Naturally, not everyone agrees. Yet Xenia Wickett, who heads the US and Americas program at the think tank called Chatham House said that the mere fact that the United States has the largest military and some great universities will protect our superpower status for a long time.Remember, though, that this has been a year of odd predictions coming true. Despite the media and the predictions of nearly every pundit, one professor, a professor who has a track record of predicting elections, predicted Donald Trump would win.As for our military and intellectual prowess, well, Trump intends to boost military spending while decreasing tax collection. That is a quick way to bankruptcy.

So much of a role, in fact, that they may have thrown the election to Donald Trump.Months after closing the investigation of Hillary Clinton s emails, FBI Director James Comey outrageously opened the investigation again during the home-stretch of the campaign season. It was a huge gift to Trump and Republicans that may have swung the election in their favor.Now a prominent Holocaust attorney who specializes in recovering artwork stolen by the Nazis has filed a lawsuit against the FBI to find out if Trump or someone from Trump s team convinced the FBI to drop a bombshell on the election.As we all know, the FBI cleared Clinton again not long after reopening the investigation. But the damage had already been done and now the country faces an uncertain and destructive future with Trump at the helm of the executive branch. I filed a lawsuit today against the US Department of Justice seeking immediate disclosure of the FBI search warrant for the e-mails of Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin on Anthony Weiner s laptop,  E, Randol Schoenberg announced on Facebook.  I think we need to see what  probable cause  was shown for obtaining the search warrant, because whoever thought there was going to be evidence of a crime was obviously mistaken. And that mistake probably changed the outcome of the election. Indeed, and if that someone was Trump or someone on his campaign, that could be grounds for impeachment. In fact, Rudy Giuliani used to be Comey s boss and he notably bragged about being in communication with the FBI during the investigation. So if it turns out the FBI reopened the investigations because of Giuliani, Trump could be in big trouble. What if the allegations were intentionally false?  Schoenberg asked on his blog. During the nine days when the investigation was underway, Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani made public statements suggesting he was in communication with the FBI about the ongoing investigation. It does not seem too far-fetched to believe that politically-motivated individuals might have tried to get the FBI to re-open the investigation of Clinton by making false allegations. Finding Huma Abedin s e-mails on Weiner s laptop might have been just an opportunity to carry out their wishes. Access to the search warrant is critical for the public to learn the basis for the re-opening of the investigation to ensure that the FBI acted in a manner consistent with its constitutional obligations under the Fourth Amendment,  Schoenberg continued.  This is potentially very serious, something that if traced back to Donald Trump might even lead to impeachment. It deserves to be investigated fully and openly, and quickly, because if a crime was committed in the course of the FBI investigation, it is the crime of the century. If Donald Trump or anyone in his corner used the FBI as some kind of secret weapon to launch an October surprise to steal the election it would be a serious crime that should not only result in Trump s impeachment, but the impeachment of every member of his administration.Furthermore, if the FBI abused their power the entire Bureau should face serious consequences.And finally, if Schoenberg s lawsuit successfully discovers treachery, this country should immediately hold an entirely new election because if Trump and the FBI worked together to rig it, Americans deserve it.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Cuomo said: There is a lesson in what happened in the election, and I believe when you get knocked on your tuchus, you should at least learn the lesson of what happened.I don t believe that Trump won. I believe that we lost that election. Noting that the Democratic Party had some soul searching over the next few years in order to get back on track, Cuomo suggested that the loss was not so much an open embrace of Trump as it was a disconnection in messaging from the Left. I think what it said to the Democrats is there is a middle class that we have not been attentive to and it s a middle class that s been suffering for a long time. Cuomo advised that New York and its citizens cannot stay silent when Trump s  tide of negativity  is encouraging others to discriminate and act out of fear and hate. Cuomo said: If you want to make America strong again then remember what made America strong in the first place. It s tolerance. It s brotherhood. It s acceptance. It s community. That is the way forward. Cuomo also said he was concerned about the intolerance and bigotry that was now resonating all across this country,  stating that there have since been many  racial incidents  in New York since Trump s election. Specifically, Cuomo spoke about an incident that happened just this week, in which a Muslim MTA worker had been attacked. These comments resonate with something Cuomo said about Trump a year ago, when Cuomo said Trump was  fanning the flames of hate  with his Islamophobic rhetoric.Cuomo, who has been rumored to be a 2020 contender, has been a solid voice in standing up to Trump s rhetoric and vowed to protect minorities in New York after Trump won the election.Featured image via Spencer Platt and Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And as this country brutally learned in 2001, these briefings can warn us about possible terrorist attacks so that we can try to prevent them.But George W.

He would rather spend his time bashing Saturday Night Live on Twitter instead of attending a briefing that may warn of another terrorist attack. And that puts our nation at serious risk.

Patterson of Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy analyzed coverage of the 2016 election and they found that coverage of the race often echoed attacks against Clinton from Trump and his Twitter account, drowning out anything positive about the former Secretary of State.There wasn t much in Clinton s general election news coverage that worked in her favor .Stories about her personal traits portrayed her as overly cautious and guarded and ran 3-to-1 negative. News reports on her policy positions trended negative by a ratio of 4-to-1. Everything from her position on health care to her position on trade was criticized, often in the form of an attack by Trump or another opponent. Her record of public service, which conceivably should have been a source of positive press, turned out differently. News reports on that topic were 62 percent negative to 38 percent positive, with Trump having a larger voice than she did in defining the meaning of her career. He was widely quoted as saying,  She s been there 30 years and has nothing to show for it. Even when the media evenly covered Clinton and Trump they often elevated nonsense stories about Clinton to the same level of serious concerns about Trump and his failures. Democrats saw many of these poorly constructed media stories in real time, and complained to the press about  false equivalence,  which allowed Trump to skate by on whether he has the temperament or maturity to be in charge of the world s largest nuclear arsenal.Thanks in large part to media malpractice, we re all going to find out if Trump can handle it.

The Hill reports Trump will not rip up NAFTA, contrary to his promises on the campaign trail:Anthony Scaramucci, a senior advisor on the Trump transition team, told a group of business leaders convened at a bipartisan meeting by the group No Labels that President-elect Donald Trump is a free-trader who is looking to make trade deals more fair, not scrap them. I don t think we re looking to rip up NAFTA as much as we are looking to right-size it and make it fairer,  Scaramucci said Monday.  He s got a great relationship, by the way, with the Mexican president. They talk regularly,  referring to Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto.Scaramucci said part of his role with Trump s economic team has been to study the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).While campaigning, Trump said he would  terminate  the deal. It was the  worst deal EVER  and needed to be  entirely renegotiated  from the ground up. What happened to that, Trump?Populist leaders on the left, such as Bernie Sanders, have been critical of NAFTA as well, so it s unlikely this will be the last Trump hears of it:Since 2001, nearly 60,000 manufacturing plants in this country have been shut down and we have lost over 4.7 million decent paying manufacturing jobs. NAFTA has led to the loss of nearly 700,000 jobs. PNTR with China has led to the loss of 2.7 million jobs. Our trade agreement with South Korea has led to the loss of about 75,000 jobs. While bad trade agreements are not the only reason why manufacturing jobs in the U.S. have declined, they are an important factor. Many labor, environmental, consumer and religious groups pushed back against NAFTA, arguing that it would create a  push-to-the-bottom in wages, destroy hundreds of thousands of good U.S. jobs, undermine democratic control of domestic policy-making and threaten health, environmental and food safety standards. The concern that the deal would undermine national sovereignty was a big one (as is currently the case with the TPP). As described by public advocacy group Public Citizen,  NAFTA contained 900 pages of one-size-fits-all rules to which each nation was required to conform all of its domestic laws   regardless of whether voters and their democratically-elected representatives had previously rejected the very same policies .Donald Trump has absolutely no interest in fulfilling any of his promises to the working class. Instead, he s giving away favors to the rich while the worst elements of the GOP step into power.Read more:Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Pruitt is busy suing the EPA.And now he s going to head it.No, really, Trump has tapped Pruitt to head an agency he s suing over Obama s rule to bring down carbon emissions. Sure, 27 other states are part of that lawsuit, but the fact that one of the participants in that suit has been chosen to lead it, well, that s a huge conflict of interest. Pruitt could render the agency toothless.Of course, environmentalists are upset with this decision, and they should be. Rhea Su, who heads the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement: The mission of the EPA and its administrator requires an absolute commitment to safeguard public health and protect our air, land, water and planet. That s the litmus test. By naming Pruitt, President-elect Trump has flunked. Exactly. Trump says he wants clean air and water and that s why he won t get rid of the EPA, but ensuring clean air and water means actually acknowledging science and using that to craft policy. Pruitt however, thinks whether climate change is man-made is still up in the air, and said so in The New York Times: Healthy debate is the lifeblood of American democracy, and global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates of our time.That debate is far from settled. Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind  Dissent is not a crime. No, dissent is not a crime. Yes, healthy debate is a good thing. Refusing to acknowledge that science says the debate is pretty much over is a bad thing. Obviously Pruitt wants his lawsuit to succeed, but now he might be able to drop or gut that rule so they win without having to worry about the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, where it s currently pending.Pruitt has to be confirmed and Democrats are starting to signal that they can t, in good conscience, confirm Pruitt because of what the EPA s mission is. Can they actually block his appointment, though?

Trump made a huge deal about  made in America,  and how American manufacturing has gone down the tubes over the last 30 years. Yet all his products are made overseas, as are most of what his daughter, Ivanka, sells in her fashion line. Trump has said that his $1 trillion infrastructure plan would have strong  buy American  requirements, so either the GOP doesn t care what their own leader wants, or Trump cares even less about American manufacturing than we thought.Or both.

This is a failure by House leadership to make a solid commitment to American manufacturers and workers,  said Senator Baldwin.  American workers should build our infrastructure with American products and taxpayers  money should not be spent on Chinese or Russian iron and steel. It s disappointing that the President-elect is sitting silent in Trump Tower. One would think that, if he can blast Boeing for something that isn t happening, then he can at least issue a statement of disappointment in House Republicans for removing the provision. Now Democrats have to introduce it as a separate amendment.It s true that the single-year provision ends up in appropriations bills for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which is a joint project between the states and the federal government for water infrastructure improvements. This particular bill would be part of that. But having to reinsert the  buy American  language in every appropriations bill every year makes it easier to remove.However, it s also true that, if Republicans were serious about bolstering American manufacturing, they d take a harder look at putting a permanent requirement in this kind of a bill. The free market certainly isn t doing anything to help, and gutting trade agreements could make things worse all throughout our economy.But whatever.

And that includes women who are raped since the amendment did not include an exemption for rape and incest.Ohio Senate President Keith Faber said his party made the move because Donald Trump won the election. A new president, new Supreme Court appointees change the dynamic, and there was consensus in our caucus to move forward,  Faber said.If Trump is able to replace deceased Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, not much would change from when he was alive since Scalia was anti-choice himself. However, if Trump gets to replace a liberal like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, it could tip the scales and pave the way for a ruling that destroys Roe v. Wade, which ruled abortion constitutional by a 7-2 margin in 1973.In addition to the fetal heartbeat portion of the amendment, doctors would be imprisoned for performing an abortion after six weeks, which also flies in the face of the Supreme Court decision in Roe, which barred states from outlawing abortion until fetal viability around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.Donald Trump is already a disaster for women s rights and reproductive health and he hasn t even taken office yet.

At least for now, Senate Dems are talking pretty big   and if the voters hold them to that path of action, it wouldn t make political sense not to continue.At issue right now is the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act as soon as they gain power, without designing a replacement first. The Republican strategy is this: repeal the ACA immediately, but with a delay until it goes into place. There is debate about how long that delay should be. Then, in the meantime, after it is repealed but before the repeal takes full effect, design a new system and pass it with partial Democratic support.In short, they want to take the healthcare of millions of Americans hostage on the off chance that Democrats will fold and do what they want.Not a chance, says Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. In an interview with the Washington Post, he had some interesting things to say about the Republican strategy moving forward: We re not going to do a replacement,  Schumer said of the Senate Democratic caucus.  If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it. Democrats will not then step up to the plate and come up with a half-baked solution that we will partially own. It s all theirs. Republicans appear to be calculating that the looming prospect of millions losing insurance will force Dems to cooperate with them to pass a replacement that covers far fewer people and offers less in consumer protection than the ACA does. (They may need Dems to pass a replacement, because some conservatives may not vote for anything that spends and regulates to expand coverage.) But if Democrats do hold the line against anything far short of the ACA, they may be able to leverage Republicans into replacing it with something that is not nearly as regressive as the GOP replacement might otherwise have been.This is what Schumer is now vowing to do. Asked directly if Democrats would refuse to support anything that falls significantly short of the ACA in terms of expanding social welfare, Schumer said:  The odds, after they repeal without any replacement, of us sitting at the table to do something that will chop one arm off instead of two is very small. Schumer said that in this scenario, Democrats would not toss Republicans a lifeline.  They broke it, they own it,  Schumer said.  All the problems in the health care system that they blamed on Obamacare will now be in their laps. We re going to make sure that we say things would have been a lot better, had they been thoughtful and careful and worked with us to fix Obamacare. And the fact remains that all Republican options on the table are horrible, anyway. They want to repeal the individual mandate immediately for political points   but removing the individual mandate will cause the price of health insurance to spike as the pool of those insured rapidly shifts to older, sicker people. Market instability will cause insurers to flee the markets, and is estimated to increase the number of uninsured to 60 million:The study found that 22.5 million people would lose coverage directly due to repeal of the law s subsidies, Medicaid expansion, and its individual requirement to carry health insurance.Another 7.3 million would become uninsured because of the ripple effects of market upheavals. That could happen if insurers lose confidence in the Republican promise of a replacement and abandon the individual market. A key industry worry is that a repeal law would get rid of subsidies and mandates but still leave insurers on the hook for covering people with health problems.The number of uninsured people would rise to nearly 59 million in 2019, and the nation would have a higher uninsured rate than when the ACA passed in 2010, the study found. (Source)That s right   if Republicans move forward with their current plan, they re going to leave things in a worse mess than they were before, and they re already expecting Democrats to fix it so that they can take all the credit. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has now made it clear: If this is the Republican plan, Democrats aren t playing ball.

California Rep. Eric Swalwell and Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings will introduce the bill in the lame duck sessionIn a letter to the White House, Schiff asked that President Obama share with members of Congress a classified report that details Russia s potential role in swaying the outcome of the election   and that it very well could have given us President Trump:We are deeply concerned by Russian efforts to undermine, interfere with and even influence the outcome of our recent election. By eroding Americans  and foreigners  trust in US institutions, Russia both weakens our country and sows global instability and uncertainty.The letter, signed by all six Democrats on the committee, comes days after Senate Democrats sent the White House a similar letter urging transparency on Russia.In Time magazine, Donald Trump told interviewers that he does not believe Russia had instigated a hack (or any other meddling) and that the concern of such was politically motivated by the Democrats: I don t believe it. I don t believe they interfered,  Trump said in an interview with Time magazine, which named him person of the year.When asked by Time if the conclusion reached by U.S. officials was motivated by politics, Trump responded,  I think so. While it s unclear how much of an impact the intrusions had on the election outcome, the revelations proved embarrassing for the Democratic Party and cost DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz her job at the top of the committee.Instead, Trump famously blamed any hacking and counter-election offenses by a 400 pound guy in a basement somewhere in the United States (without providing evidence).While Trump peddles conspiracy theories, Democrats seek to legitimize the electoral process of the United States.Featured image via Winn McNamee/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He has created a toxic atmosphere of hate that has only hurt this country and millions of Americans who now face the daily threat of hate crimes and bullying.

Can we agree, Mr. President-elect Trump, that at this stage it would be better for you to simply stop watching SNL?  Lauer asked.  As opposed to watching it and then complaining about it? As we all know, Trump has repeatedly thrown a temper tantrum every time he watches Alec Baldwin s perfect impersonation of him on the longtime comedy skit show.After Baldwin s latest performance, Trump took to Twitter to whine.Just tried watching Saturday Night Live   unwatchable!

The bill, titled Senate Bill 269, will allow for doctors to decide how much or which part of the plant to use in order to treat patients with chronic health conditions such as severe autism, epilepsy, PTSD and a wealth of other disorders that cause debilitating pain and mental and physical disabilities.After this unprecedented bill was filed in Texas on Tuesday morning, Menendez held a press conference along with citizens who were there to speak about why this bill is so important to their lives and what cannabis will do for their children and families who are suffering.Senator Menendez opens with his reasons for this crucial bill: No one has died from an overdose of cannabis in this country,  said Menendez. 44 people are dying every single day from overdoses of painkillers, prescription painkillers. Why if we re such a state that is always been, we thrive on talking about our independence and less regulation and less government and all of these things, why are we deciding to put more government or a politician s decisions between a patient and their doctors. One mother, Debbie Tolany, spoke at length about her 13-year-old son, Miles, who is affected by autism, has intractable epilepsy and a rare endocrine disorder called hypoparathyroid disease. In 2015, Texas passed a bill allowing for the limited use of cannabis for certain patients with epilepsy which a giant leap for the red state, but unfortunately, it wasn t enough to help Miles and others like him. Doctors, having little control over the treatment they prescribe, are forced to use medicines with chemical side-effects that can be severely damaging to the brain and can continue to be a detriment to the well-being of their patients.Debbie had this to say about her son and the side-effects that Miles recently endured from chemical medications prescribed to him: I watched a child with low muscle tone and usually low endurance for physical movement run in frantic circles around my living room for 30 minutes. His face and lips were completely white and he cried out in pain, looking at me for support, which his body would not allow him to receive. No parent should have to watch their son suffer in such a way and no human being should be FORCED by doctors, who are supposed to be taking care of them, to ingest chemicals that only make things worse.The answer for these families is pretty simple.

He s just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs. He s one of the great men of industry, so I just want to thank you very much. Thank you. Source: PoliticoHere s the video:Anyone who s followed business or has ever taken a business class knows that it s impossible to iron out a deal like this in just a few weeks. Well, that s because it hasn t been ironed out and, well, it s been in the works since October.SunBank is not a bank. They are a technology company with a majority ownership in Sprint. They had previously tried to merge with T-Mobile but gave up after Obama expressed a concern about growing telecom monopolies. This is likely the reason Son is excited about Trump s presidency.In October, SoftBank announced the creation of a $100 billion fund, backed by Saudi Arabia. It appears that this latest  deal  is part of that.The reason  deal  is in quotes in the above paragraph is that there is no deal. There is talk of a deal, but all we ve seen so far is a PowerPoint slide. There is no legally-binding contract, there is no timeline, although according to the PowerPoint slide, it would take place over four years. As for the $50 billion investment, only a portion of that will be coming from SoftBank if it comes at all.Son said in a speech Friday in New Delhi that $25 billion of the money was put up by SoftBank, $45 billion by the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, and the remaining $30 billion by other investors, according to Bloomberg.The fund, therefore, plans to invest half of what it has raised in the US. For comparison, a study of all 2015 venture capital funding in the world by EY found that roughly half of these investments were made in US-based companies, so this allocation does not appear to be out of the ordinary.Source: Business InsiderPerhaps the most important thing is that SoftBank, like Trump, can t be trusted. They are already a large American employer and just last year, Son announced his plan to cut thousands of jobs. However, even as early as last November, Son was hinting at this latest plan, saying that he plans on increasing the company s stake in Sprint.Featured image via Sara D.

Trump, however, is treating this like a simple business thing (because he doesn t know any better and considers himself to be the preeminent genius of the world), and it s not.Thankfully, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James was only too happy to enlighten Trump with some of the nuance behind a contract like this, which Trump would do well to learn: Air Force One, although it is a 747 platform, is way, way more than what you would think of as a commercial airliner. It really is, in many ways, a flying White House, in terms of the security. There s [electronic] countermeasures built in, communications, very high level communications, security of all types. After all, this is carrying the president of the United States. It has to go long distances, it has to survive under difficult circumstances, much more difficulty than a normal civilian airliner. So it is a bit more complicated than perhaps meets the eye. And then she dropped this truth bomb on Trump: There are professional security people who are in the White House who develop requirements for Air Force One. They are not political appointees; they are professional security people. Those requirements then come to the Air Force and our job is to build the acquisition strategy around it to deliver those requirements. In other words, we didn t make up all these security factors and communications standards. The price tag on these planes could be lowered, she notes, if you change the requirements on it. Since the White House sets the requirements based on what they need to protect the President, and what the President needs to do his job from the air, then neither Boeing nor the Air Force really sets a price. It s a negotiation and the price tag, at $170 million (not four effing billion) is probably very reasonable, given what all is involved.We should also note that these planes won t even be in service for another decade   well after Trump is out of office even if he were to win re-election in 2020.And yet, here s Donald Trump, on Twitter, acting as though the Air Force is just shoveling money into the fire willy-nilly, and/or that Boeing is severely overcharging just because they can.Her entire response can be paraphrased to,  With all due respect, sir, you don t get it.  In providing a detailed explanation, she was not only clarifying what was going on and allaying any worries that might arise from the cost, but she was also telling Trump that he was totally ignorant about the entire process.His tweet was dangerous. It sent Boeing s stocks tumbling briefly. Trump needs to get informed and stop tweeting on his own, or someone needs to take his phone away from him so this doesn t happen again.

We transition now to a national security adviser [Flynn]   in a political realm   who argues that an opponent, on the stump, should be locked up in prison, who argues that a billion plus Muslims should be grouped together.

In my own words:Flynn isn t as bad as Trump s other picks at first glance, that is. He seems to have no clue what he s talking about with regard to many political issues, but on the subject of national security, he does at least have some expertise. Unfortunately, that expertise is tempered with a  let s bomb the shit out of everything!  attitude combined with extreme Islamophobia. Lovely.

He may have overestimated the power of the US. He may have already been obsessed with the power he is about to have a grip on, and wishes the whole world should follow his lead. He may also believe that if China, the biggest power after the US, is awed by Washington, it will solve all other problems.No matter what Trump thinks, China must be determined to upset his unreasonable requests at his early time in office, and fight back if his moves harm China s interests, regardless of the consequences to the dynamics of the Sino-US relationship. If China behaves soft-heartedly for the greater good of the bilateral ties, it will only embolden Trump to be more aggressive.Trump s China-bashing tweet is just a cover for his real intent, which is to treat China as a fat lamb and cut a piece of meat off it. Trump wants to revive US economy, but he knows that his country is not as competitive as it used to be. He is trying to pillage other countries for the prosperity of the US. Trump sems to be wanting to make the US a new economic empire in the 21st century under his leadership, which is about to smash current world economic order. However, he doesn t know that the US is the biggest beneficiary from the current world order, and he wants to reshape the world order into a winner-takes-all one.China Daily chided Trump for his  lame  excuses about the phone call, noting that no matter the reason he  broke a decades-old bilateral diplomatic consensus and touched an ultra-sensitive diplomatic nerve.  The publication goes on to say that the incoming POTUS must familiarize himself with the way the world works outside his bubble because shit s about to get real when he is President and they can t roll their eyes at him any longer:Trump may dislike, distrust the diplomatic establishment in Washington D.C., and aspire to rework US foreign policies. But he should first come to terms with the real, not imagined, reality of international relations before wielding the scalpel, because a misstep as president will be far more damaging than one as president-elect.As president-elect, Trump can expect some forgiveness even when he is shooting from the hip.

Otherwise, he will make costly troubles for his country, and find himself trying to bluster his way through constant diplomatic conflagrations.Donald Trump hasn t stepped foot in the Oval Office yet and he s already an international embarrassment   and he needs to get his shit straight before he can do even more damage.Featured image via Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The only constant in the GOP universe these days is believing whatever it is Trump wants them to believe.That s the only explanation I can think of for the results of the following polls. This one, from Politico, shows overwhelming numbers of Republican supporting direct federal negotiation with individual businesses, tax breaks or incentives offered to specific individual businesses ( crony capitalism ), and advantages on government contractors for specific businesses:The best part? Even the GOP platform doesn t agree! Here s more, directly from the 2016 platform:Cronyism is inherent in the progressive vision of the administrative state. When government uses taxpayer funding and resources to give special advantages to private companies, it distorts the free market and erodes public trust in our political system. By enlarging the scope of government and placing enormous power in the hands of bureaucrats, it multiplies opportunities for corruption and favoritism. It is the enemy of reform in education, the workplace, and healthcare. It gives us financial regulation that protects the large at the cost of the small. It is inherent in every part of the current healthcare law, which is packed with corporate welfare. Crony capitalism gives us special interest tax breaks, custom-designed regulations, and special exemptions for favored parties. The Solyndra debacle is a perfect example. It creates both subsidies and restrictions to tilt the market one way or the other. By putting the weight of government behind the status quo, it leads to economic stagnation.Now, I feel it is important to note that I don t agree with Republican economic theories at all. There is no such thing as a truly  free market  when markets are an abstract concept defined by and regulated by a central authority   no matter how much libertarian-minded conservatives may wish otherwise. Yet it can t be denied that Trump and pence   and GOP views right now overall   do not see remotely eye to eye with the stance outlined in the platform.Strong regulatory rules that are the same for everyone (progressive economics) are a far cry from  whoever the president wants to win, wins.  What Republicans are currently claiming to be in support of isn t a free market. It s fascism, and it s as big as big government gets. Even Sarah fucking Palin understands that!It gets better. Another poll, from the Economist/YouGov, shows that Republicans are completely open with their newfound lack of free market economics:As you can see, traditional politics has been turned on its head   this poll shows MUCH higher support for free market economics among Democrats and independents than Republicans.Now, interpretation. I don t think anything has actually changed at all for the average Republican voter. They believe the same things day to day they always did. They re just not that smart, and they have way too much respect for authoritative leaders   they re authoritarian followers who think a  strong  leader like Trump always knows what is best. So this is less of a case of switched beliefs, and more a case of  whatever dad says goes. Some conservative leaders have tried to fight back against Trump s professed love of fascist economics, but the reasonable voices in the GOP (by their standard) should have learned that they were drowned out long ago. This is Trump s party now. And soon, it s Trump s America.The right wing has lost all sense of leadership and guidance and is now abandoning its own core principles in a desperate bid to retain power. And I don t mean over one election   they know the future of their party is in danger. Hillary s 2.6 million popular vote victory, the simmering anger of a large number of Americans, and the upcoming census elections are ensuring that the few smart Republicans left see the writing on the wall: unless they pull off some massive populist victories during the next few years, they re doomed.With Trump at the helm and support for fascism on the rise, things are not looking good.Featured image partial shot of embedded Politico poll""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

HOWEVER. There s a catch. Carrier has announced that it will raise its prices in January. A death spiral can begin with that, and it appears that it s something Trump only fleetingly considered.Carrier insists that their decision to raise prices has nothing to do with their decision to keep some jobs here. Indeed, they did announce their price increase a week before Trump reached a deal with them. The problem is that, if their prices go up and competitors  prices don t, they ll find themselves at a disadvantage if they find they actually need the price increase to offset higher manufacturing costs. Then those saved jobs could disappear anyway.There are also global forces that have taken manufacturing jobs away from the U.S. that we can t stop no matter how many individual deals Trump manages to strike. Carrier, and others, may find themselves not just at a disadvantage with each other, but at a severe disadvantage with foreign competitors, even if Trump tries to slap a tariff on those imports (which won t work).As many people have noted, striking deals with companies one by one is not the way to improve our jobs market or our economy. And economists all over the political spectrum believe this is a seriously bad idea   they destroy an economy from the inside out. Even Sarah Palin recognizes this as crony capitalism, and Sarah Palin is about as dense and clueless as they come. The government is not a business and Trump needs to stop acting like it is.Besides all that, other companies that game Trump to get bigger tax breaks could still raise their prices, and still basically do what greedy corporations do to enrich themselves and fuck the rest of us sideways with rusty chainsaws. We need broad economic policy and overhaul, not individual deals with manufacturers and huge tariffs on companies that offshore jobs.Whether Carrier was already going to raise prices or not, this little announcement shows one of the many dark sides of Trump s approach to saving jobs.

Icy Silence from Climate Alarmists https://t.co/uLUPW4o93V  Sci,Space,&Tech Cmte (@HouseScience) December 1, 2016The Weather Channel then when through claim by claim made and thoroughly debunked the misinformation, and even said: Here s the thing, science doesn t care about your opinion. Cherrypicking and changing the facts will not change the future, nor the fact, note fact, not opinion, the earth is warming. Here are the debunked claims:CLAIM:  Global land temperatures have plummeted by one degree Celsius since the middle of this year   the biggest and steepest fall on record. TRUTH: This number comes from one satellite-based estimate of temperatures above land areas in the lower atmosphere. Data from the other two groups that regularly publish satellite-based temperature estimates show smaller drops, more typical of the decline one would expect after a strong El Ni o event.Temperatures over land give an incomplete picture of global-scale temperature. Most of the planet   about 70 percent   is covered by water, and the land surface warms and cools more quickly than the ocean. Land-plus-ocean data from the other two satellite groups, released after the Breitbart article, show that Earth s lower atmosphere actually set a record high in November 2016.CLAIM:  It can be argued that without the El Ni o (and the so-called  Pacific Blob ) 2014-2016 would not have been record warm years.  (David Whitehouse, Global Warming Policy Foundation, quoted by Breitbart)TRUTH: NOAA data show that the 2014-16 El Ni o did not even begin until October 2014. It was a borderline event until mid-2015, barely above the El Ni o threshold. El Ni o clearly added to the strength of the record global warmth observed since late 2015. However, if the El Ni o spike is removed, 2016 is still the warmest year on record and 2015 the second warmest, according to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather (Berkeley Earth).CLAIM:  Many think that 2017 will be cooler than previous years. Myles Allen of Oxford University says that by the time of the next big United Nations climate conference, global temperatures are likely to be no warmer than the Paris COP in 2015. This would be a strange thing to happen if, as some climate scientists have claimed, recent years would have been a record even without the El Ni o.  (David Rose, U.K. Daily Mail, quoted by Breitbart)TRUTH: There is nothing unusual about a drop in global surface temperatures when going from El Ni o to La Nina. These ups and downs occur on top of the long-term warming trend that remains when the El Ni o and La Ni a signals are removed. If there were no long-term trend, then we would see global record lows occurring during the strongest La Ni a events. However, the last year to see global temperatures hit a record low was 1911, and the most recent year that fell below the 20th-century average was 1976.Watch the full video and breakdown from The Weather Channel HERE.As horrible as all of this is, it s actually kind of hilarious that The Weather Channel so thoroughly threw Breitbart under the bus. They deserve to be condemned and the fact remains that Climate Change is absolutely real and we need to start doing more to combat it.Featured image via The Weather Channel screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Boeing was quick to set him straight, however   considering the project is more than an order of magnitude less than Trump thinks it is. Here s Boeing s statement on the matter:We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.According to Rueters, in January, when the contract was awarded,  Details about the total value of the new contract have not been released, but the Air Force has previously said that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two replacement jets.

Even various right wing publications which have blown up the cost over the last year have not reported a figure over three billion, and even that was not sourced to any budget sheet.And, no matter the cost, it s very clear that Donald Trump has no idea what is being paid for. There will be multiple planes, first of all   two or three   and even if the project DID run that far over budget (there is no evidence of that), it s not just the president s version of a private jet:What drives the price tag isn t the cost of the plane, it s all the costly modifications and equipment that must be installed on such a unique aircraft,  said Loren B. Thompson, a senior aviation analyst and industry consultant with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.Air Force One is filled with communications gear and defensive equipment to evade airborne threats, such as anti-aircraft missiles. It s really not just about getting the president from point A to point B,  Buckley said.  It s adding communication equipment. It s adding defensive gear. It s adding everything that the president needs in order to execute his mission in that airplane. He has to be able to do everything in all his roles: commander in chief, chief executive, head of state, president of the United States. Boeing s 747 is the only U.S.-built jet that can support all the functions required of an airborne White House,  Thompson said.  The plane must be linked to all U.S. military forces worldwide and able to function even in the midst of a nuclear war.

Thus far, the costs of protecting him in that tower are around $1 million per day.Now, sure, President Obama, Michelle and their daughters needed protection when they were in Chicago, Hawaii, etc. However, they didn t go back to Chicago or Hawaii nearly every weekend, and Obama took significantly fewer vacation days than George W.

Politifact rated that statement  Pants on Fire,  because the actual cost was considerably lower, and Trump, true to form, had no basis for his outlandish claim.McClatchy went after Obama for the price tag of his vacations, which was supposedly upwards of $70 million. Their number came from the right-wing group Judicial Watch.

Republicans in general have that habit.During the second presidential debate, Donald Trump was asked whether he could be a president to  all the people in the United States.  He had a very specific answer:  I would be a president for all of the people, African Americans, the inner cities,  he replied. Later in the debate, he spoke again of how he was going to help  the African Americans,  who lived in  inner cities,  suffering from high poverty rates, bad educational systems, and no jobs.Source: The AtlanticWell, it s simply not true. Most African-Americans do not live in the inner city and most live above the poverty line, but that doesn t stop Trump and Republicans from their two dimensional view of African-Americans, which is likely the exact reason Trump chose Carson as his inner city spokesperson. Carson is African-American, and the fact that he has literally no experience at doing anything remotely relevant to that job is completely beside the point. You see, black people, according to Trump, are black before they are anything else   even black brain surgeons. Am I reading too much into the nomination? Well, here are Trump s words: I am thrilled to nominate Dr. Ben Carson as our next Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ben Carson has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities,  Trump is quoted as saying in a statement released by his transition team Monday.Source: Washington PostTo be fair, Carson did grow up in public housing. Although, he turned his back on the inner cities and despite the fact that he wouldn t be where he is without government assistance, he, like so many Republicans, wants to deprive others of government assistance.And then there s the fact that he has no experience in the government, and even he acknowledged that he was too inexperienced for a position he might have actually been qualified for. His name had been fielded for being in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services. Carson is reported to have turned it down, citing his lack of government qualifications.So why is he suddenly qualified for HUD? Well, it s likely because the Trump administration has no plans whatsoever to help those in need find housing.

I do think you need to be careful,  Cheney said.  But he ll learn as he goes along. I think he is putting some brains and good people with him. I am a big fan of [Vice President-elect] Mike Pence. I think one of the reasons people get so concerned about the tweets is it s sort of a way around the press,  Dick said.  It s modern era, modern technology. He s at the point where we don t need you guys anymore. I apologize,  Cheney added.Watch at around the 18 minute mark:Apology not accepted, Dick.Oh sure, just what we need. A president who has to  learn as he goes along.  Trump supporters wanted a man in the White House with zero political experience.

That claim is groundless,  Stephanopoulos said.  There s no evidence to back it up. Is it responsible for a president-elect to make false statements like that?

He would do this to avoid criticism and it s not illegal even though the Congressional Budget Act requires the president to submit the fiscal 2018 budget to Congress between January 2nd and February 6th. As Forbes notes, Trump could easily say that it was the responsibility of the outgoing Obama administration to comply with the law before the new president was sworn in on January 20.  Forbes  source of this news was someone in the GOP congressional leadership.Again, this is unprecedented, but there s a reason #TrumpFirsts was trending on Twitter yesterday. Clearly, the man doesn t know how to President:Every in-coming president since the Congressional Budget Act went into effect in the mid-1970s has submitted a budget. In many years, those budgets (or amendments to the outgoing president s final budget) were submitted months after the first-Monday-in-February deadline and were truncated versions of the usual multi-volume presentation. But, a fiscal plan with the new president s priorities was consistently released for over 4 decades.A newly elected President is typically eager to submit a budget the first year because it s an opportunity to display the details and plans for things to come. It s showing the new President s priorities. But after a budget is submitted, it gives a platform for those who will criticize the administration. So if there s no proposal then there s no criticism.And as for those promises Trump made: it would also eliminate the need for the administration to publish a table with the very optimistic GDP growth promised during the campaign, the high interest rates many economists think are coming and Trump s unrealistic assumptions on jobs and unemployment.This is coming from a man who didn t release his taxes during his campaign. That, too, is not presidential. We d love to hear a good defense on this from Trump supporters. Y all got burned and we re going to have to clean another Republican President s mess up when he creates an apocalyptic economy. By the way, the jobless rate is 4.6 percent right now.

Trump also intends to do away with regulations, which basically gives business owners the ability to do whatever the hell they want, which will be especially dangerous if the regulations Trump is talking about are safety regulations, food quality, etc Big businesses will be especially happy about this because they already pay little in taxes anyway.But then Trump threatens to punish businesses with a 35 percent tax if they move operations overseas.This doesn t make a lot of sense and businesses are probably laughing their asses off right now. Trump is already giving them a massive tax cut and less regulations, which means taxing them 35 percent isn t going to be much of a punishment at all.In fact, Trump s recent Carrier deal is the perfect example of how corporations will treat Trump s threats. Despite claiming that he saved jobs, Trump s so-called deal with Carrier cost taxpayers $7 million. Carrier gets that money and they STILL sent more jobs to Mexico than they kept in Indiana and then announced that they are closing another factory.

Hillary Clinton announced that she would back Stein s recount efforts in all three states, which prompted Trump to lose his mind. He railed against the efforts on Twitter and denounced the bid for recounts as nothing more than a  scam.  Ironically, he made the case for a recount of even more states at the very same time with his own claims of widespread voter fraud.It is unlikely that the recount would successfully change the outcome of the election in the long run, especially since a margin of this size has never before been overcome. However, Trump sure was acting like he was scared to death of a second look. It seems that, at least in Pennsylvania, he is going to get his way. In Wisconsin and Michigan, Trump has not been so lucky. The recounts in both of these states have already begun. But the push for a recount in the Keystone State seems to have come to an end.On Saturday night, the Pennsylvania GOP issued a statement that read, in part: The filing of a discontinuance of the Election Contest by Jill Stein s petitioners tonight is a recognition that their Election Contest was completely without merit, and meant solely for purposes to delay the Electoral College vote in Pennsylvania for President-Elect Trump Candidate Jill Stein s allegations created the false allusion that some unidentified foreign government hacked our state s voting systems when absolutely no such proof existed. We believe that she always knew that she had no such proof. Pennsylvania election officials published the updated vote count on Friday, which showed Trump s lead over his Democratic rival shrinking to 49,000 from 71,000. As shocking as this may sound, this did not meet Pennsylvania s 0.5 percent trigger for an automatic statewide recount.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

So far, his cabinet picks are basically a  who s who  of Washington insiders and big business executives, making the swamp slimier than ever.And the Democratic Party isn t missing the opportunity to highlight Trump s incompetence and hypocrisy.In a 30-second video released on Twitter, the Democrats lambasted Trump for hiring the very idiots who caused the financial crisis to undo all of the hard work done by the Obama administration to pull this country back from the brink of financial ruin.You can watch the video below: We ve seen so much economic growth over the last 6 years. Now Donald Trump is hiring the people who created the crisis we recovered from. pic.twitter.com/F7nQqDCmUM  The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) December 3, 2016Although the list is always changing (you can see a live updated version by The New York Times here), here s a quick rundown of his current appointments and their anything-but outsider backgrounds:Steve Bannon is a white supremacist and nationalist, and architect of Breitbart, which he has called a platform of the  alt-right.  Alt-right is the politically correct word for neo-Nazis that can t stand being called neo-Nazis. He was also an investment banker at Goldman-Sachs, and ran his own financial firm, Bannon & Co.Reince Priebus, who was chairman to the RNC and instrumental in the rise of Paul Ryan, Scott Walker, and others, is about as establishment as you can get. He s a lawyer and career politician, and was the chairman of one of two major political parties. What is more establishment than that?! Yet, for his early promotion of the Donald, he s getting rewarded with a spot in the White House. Trump doesn t give a damn about draining the swamp; he s giving favors to friends.Flynn isn t as bad as Trump s other picks at first glance, that is. He seems to have no clue what he s talking about with regard to many political issues, but on the subject of national security, he does at least have some expertise. Unfortunately, that expertise is tempered with a  let s bomb the shit out of everything!  attitude combined with extreme Islamophobia. Lovely. He s also been reported to have a loose relationship with the truth. A leaked email from former Secretary of State and four-star general Colin Powell is even more telling: I spoke at DIA last month,  Powell wrote to his son, Michael, on July 19 before relaying a story he apparently heard from Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, the current DIA director.  Flynn got fired as head of DIA. His replacement is a black Marine 3-star. I asked why Flynn got fired. Abusive with staff, didn t listen, worked against policy, bad management, etc. He has been and was right-wing nutty every [sic] since.  (The Washington Post)Come on, Trump, you can t do better than that? Who am I kidding   of course you can t.None of those require Senate confirmation, so they re already a done deal. The following names, however, are not yet set in stone, but are likely:I won t get into the many, many terrible policy positions of Jeff Sessions. That s not important here. What is important is that he is another career politician who is owned by the insurance industry and has no interest in fighting for the common citizen. He s yet another swamp monster in an administration that won an election on the promise of changing business as usual in Washington.It s hard to know where to start with Betsy DeVos. Her desire to privatize education, not improve it? Her belief in creationism? The fact that she thinks Christianity belongs in public schools? Or maybe just that she s another billionaire swamp monster? She married into Amway money. Amway, if you re not familiar, is a massive pyramid scheme under investigation in many countries for its  multi-level marketing  scam ( multi-level marketing  is code for  pyramid scam ). It s one of the largest privately held companies in the United States. And she is a HUGE political donor who is very fond of money influencing the political process.You know who would make the best Secretary of the Treasury when you re trying to get rid of  business as usual  in Washington? A billionaire investment banker and hedge fund manager who spent 17 years at Goldman-Sachs, that s who! Here s a flashback to Trump just months ago: I m not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We re going to tax Wall Street. Huh. How about that.Steven Mnuchin been sued by Trump, partnered with George Soros, and has done basically anything he can to make as much money as possible. It s hard to see how liberals or conservatives would support him, but Trump supporters will follow him no matter what he does or how many promises he breaks.And in case you forgot, people like Mnuchin caused the Great Recession. Now we ve gone from not regulating them enough and allowing them to buy politicians to directly placing them in power! That s some great swamp draining right there.Wilbur Ross is a predatory billionaire investor and former banker. Is this starting to sound repetitive? He also served under Rudy Giuliani, as well as Bill Clinton, and has been both a Democrat and a Republican as the need arises. Not exactly a political outsider!And heads up, coal miners: He s currently under investigation by multiple agencies for his degree of responsibility in the deaths of a dozen coal miners in West Virginia. The mine that collapsed had over 200 safety citations, and he was  intimately familiar  with the company and problems in question during the time leading up to the incident. Do you think Trump really gives a flying fuck about you when he s hiring people like that?Elaine Chao has served under two previous Republican administrations already, as well as obtaining a White House fellowship under Reagan. She was the Secretary of Labor under Dubya, and the Deputy Secretary of Transportation under his marginally more competent father, President George H.W. Bush.She s also Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s wife. Not only that, but she s worked at multiple banks as well as the Heritage Foundation. She is as deeply embedded in the world of politics and the swamp of Washington as it is possible to be.With this list of Washington insiders and bank executives on their way onto the White House team, it s more clear than ever that everything Trump told his supporters during his campaign was a lie. He s in it for himself, his children, and his rich friends. After that, he ll listen to anybody that pretends they like him or tells him what he wants to hear.

What I read was of no comfort. Trump, it seems, has total carte blanche for destroying the world. No one can stop him.If you recall, a few months ago Trump spoke with a foreign policy expert. Trump allegedly asked the expert three times why we can t use nuclear weapons.Beyond that, we know that Trump is terribly thin-skinned and set for vengeance upon anyone who dares offend him.Yes, that s terrifying, but doesn t Congress provide checks and balances? Even congressional Republicans certainly know the consequences of nuclear war, right? It turns out, it doesn t matter. With congressional approval or without it, Trump can do whatever the hell he wants with nuclear weapons.Now they re his. When Trump takes office in January, he will have sole authority over more than 7,000 warheads. There is no failsafe. The whole point of U.S. nuclear weapons control is to make sure that the president   and only the president   can use them if and whenever he decides to do so. The one sure way to keep President Trump from launching a nuclear attack, under the system we ve had in place since the early Cold War, would have been to elect someone else.Why in the world would a single person ever have that much responsibility? Well, the short answer is that no one ever anticipated that in our electoral system, there would be a President Donald Trump.The more complex answer is that the president is the check to balance a hawkish military.The members of Congress who wrote the law, largely with the backing of the scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project, framed it explicitly as a question of who controls the power to use nuclear weapons: Is dropping an atomic bomb a military act or a political one? If it is inherently political, above and beyond a regular military tactic, then that power could not be entrusted to the military. Ultimately, the president was supposed to be the check against the Pentagon pushing to use nukes more often.One person did predict a Trump of sorts. While the country was still reeling from Watergate in 1973, 21-year Air Force veteran Maj. Harold Hering asked:How could he be sure that an order to launch his missiles was lawful? How could he be sure, for example, that the president wasn t insane? Instead of an answer, he got the boot: an aborted promotion and an administrative discharge for  failure to demonstrate acceptable qualities of leadership  and for indicating  a defective mental attitude towards his duties. Now, there is one person between the President and nuclear annihilation, the secretary of defense. The SoD is actually the person to carry out the launch, not the President, but the SoD, unlike Congress, works for the President. It s unclear if he (or she) can even say no. Trump s nominee is James  Mad Dog  Mattis. He s a war hawk who once said that killing people was  a hell of a lot of fun.  In other words, even if he could tell his boss no, he probably wouldn t.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Now they re solidifying that with a  repeal and delay  plan.Or, rather,  repeal and let the sh*t hit the fan  plan. They still have no plan for replacing it, but they just have to repeal now so that s what they re going to do.

We will have a transition period so Congress can develop the right policies and the American people can have time to look for better health care options. Because Congress can totally agree on everything that needs to happen for Americans to have decent access to decent healthcare. Their delusion on this is deep and complex, too. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy believes that, once it s officially repealed, fewer people will want to play politics and more will be willing to come to the table and support a Republican solution.Har de har har.

Sabrina Corlette, who teaches at the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown, said: The idea that you can repeal the Affordable Care Act with a two- or three-year transition period and not create market chaos is a total fantasy.

But Trump supporter Betsy McCaughey repeatedly claimed otherwise and actually had the gall to accuse Democrats of being the real racists during a Saturday appearance on CNN with Democratic counterpart Symone Sanders, who is black. I think the campaign has been very gracious in victory,  McCaughey claimed.  But what disturbs me the most is to see the Democratic Party leaders and spokespeople like Symone are still making false accusations of racism   in fact, behaving like racists themselves. One reason Donald Trump won is Americans are sick and tired of reverse racism and that s what they heard from Hillary Clinton at the beginning. Except that Hillary Clinton s message was about coming together and building a stronger America for everyone. Trump, meanwhile, questioned President Obama s place of birth for years, accused a judge of being biased because  he s a Mexican,  repeatedly condoned beatings of black protesters at his rallies, and refused to denounce white supremacists among many other examples.McCaughey ranted on about how Democrats are to blame for racism in this country, only to be absolutely BURIED by Sanders. We ve got to cut this out,  Sanders said.  Betsy, people of color in America are victims of systemic racism and I think it s really important to note that while the Trump campaign, yes, they won. Donald Trump is going to be the next president, there are still some real underlying issues. The rhetoric that the campaign elevated, these fringe elements that they brought into the mainstream. These are the things that people in America are still dealing with. The Trump campaign has to at least own that so we can move forward. And the truth-bomb that Sanders dropped made McCaughey lose her shit to the point that she actually directed a racist term at Sanders and instantly proved Sanders  point. I don t appreciate these accusations of racism because they are untrue and the only reason that people like Symone constantly label their opponents as racist is because they don t have an argument they can win on the merits. Again, Symone Sanders is a black woman, so when McCaughey said  people like Symone,  it was instantly recognized as racist. Racists often use the term  you people  as a racial slur in order to dehumanize their opponent and blame an entire class or race of people for something.Even Sanders pointed it out.  Betsy just  You people-d  me. Thank you. Thus, Sanders won the argument and made McCaughey reveal herself as a racist on national television.Here s the video via YouTube.McCaughey is also dead wrong about Trump being gracious in victory. He has been anything but gracious. In fact, he s rubbing it in by going on an unprecedented victory tour. If President Obama had done that in 2012, conservatives would have thrown temper tantrums across the country and hurled the N-word at will.The bottom line is that Donald Trump did NOT win this election by having better policies. He won because he energized the racists in this country to vote for him. And the fact that he picked people like Jeff Sessions and Steve Bannon for key positions in his administration speaks volumes about how racist he is, especially since the KKK and white nationalists overwhelmingly approve of those two choices.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

For the first time in a long time, I feel very positive about this, because Donald Trump is not beholden to the pharmaceutical industry,  Wakefield said.  He didn t rely upon [drug makers] to get him elected. And he s a man who seems to speak his mind and act accordingly. So we shall see. Now Americans have to fear a world where anyone around them could be carrying a disease that could have been easily prevented by a harmless vaccine because Trump is listening to a crackpot.Thus far, the anti-vaxxer movement has caused outbreaks of whooping cough, rubella, and measles, just to name a few. Measles had been declared eradicated in 2000, but after many parents had a collective freak-out they stopped vaccinating their damn kids and opened the door for measles and other diseases to return. Measles kicked that door down in 2015 when the disease struck many who were unvaccinated after a visitor from another country carried it and spread it to others at Disneyland.At the height of the outbreak, Fox medical expert Dr. Marc Siegel blasted anti-vaxxers and defended vaccines as necessary for the public health. Let me be clear on this, I see no debate whatsoever,  Siegel said.  Period. This is the greatest vaccine that has ever been created in the history of vaccines. You know we stamped out measles in the United States in 2000. It was incredible because measles is the most contagious virus known to man. If you had measles there would be a 90 percent chance that I would get it by sitting next to you if I weren t vaccinated. It s so much more contagious than the flu. We were talking about Ebola, this is a million times more contagious than Ebola! Your celebrities did not go to medical school! In California, there s 13,000 parents that are taking a personal belief exemption, allowing their kids to go to school without that second MMR vaccine. You need one after you re 1 year old, and then you need one again before you re 5 or 6 years old. I think these parents are putting children at risk in schools. I think schools should consider not allowing these kids in. Make them be homeschooled if they don t have this vaccine. Why should my child be a risk because your child isn t vaccinated? Later that year, the first American in over a decade died after contracting measles.And if Donald Trump aids anti-vaxxers by changing federal policy, he will become a direct threat to the public health as it becomes more likely that diseases once considered eradicated in this country thanks to vaccines return with a deadly vengeance all because we let a bunch of stupid people who reject science influence policy.Featured Image: MNN""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And his recklessness has now drawn an angry response from the Chinese government.In a statement, the Chinese foreign ministry lodged a formal protest and warned Trump to beware of risking relations between our two nations again.  It must be pointed out that there is only one China in the world,  Chinese officials said.  We urge the relevant side in the US to adhere to the  one China  policy, abide by the pledges in the three joint China-US communiques, and handle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall China-U.S. relationship. Again, Trump has not even taken office yet and he is already screwing up decades worth of established foreign policy, proving once again that he is too irresponsible to be president.China is a major holder of U.S. foreign debt and is a major manufacturer of products sold by American businesses. So pissing the Chinese off could not only lead to a war, it could substantially cripple our economy.Donald Trump serious needs to read the relevant intelligence and foreign policy briefings so he doesn t do anything stupid like this again.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

His cabinet is set to be the wealthiest in history and most of his picks are Washington insiders and elites that conservatives loathe.And many conservatives now realize that Trump is going to help Republicans wipe out Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, programs Trump repeatedly swore to leave intact.Trump will also not prosecute Hillary Clinton and the  big beautiful wall  he promised to build along the Mexican border is apparently going to be more like a lame fence instead.So, many of Trump s supporters are regretting the choice they made on Election Day and are expressing that regret on social media.

The move left political observers scratching their heads and wondering how he could have possibly thought this was a good idea. The answer is simple. It s the same reason Trump does everything   he thinks he can get something out of it. In this case, another luxury resort.In 1979, the United States severed all diplomatic ties with Taiwan and adopted a One China stance. Since that time, no president (or president-elect) has spoken with the country s president. As far as China is concerned, Taiwan is part of China. Trump s phone call with Tsai Ying-wen, the president of Taiwan,  is likely to infuriate Beijing which regards the island as a renegade province. So why on earth would Trump do something like this? Go figure, the Trump Organization just happens to be looking at Taiwan as a location for their next luxury resort.The Shangiist, a publication that covers news in China, reported the following in November:The mayor of Taoyuan confirmed rumors on Wednesday that US president-elect Donald Trump was considering constructing a series of luxury hotels and resorts in the northwest Taiwanese city.A representative from the Trump Organization paid a visit to Taoyuan in September, expressing interest in the city s Aerotropolis, a large-scale urban development project aimed at capitalizing on Taoyuan s status as a transport hub for East Asia, Taiwan News reports. With the review process for the Aerotropolis still underway, Taoyuan s mayor referred to the subject of the meeting as mere investment speculation. Other reports indicate that Eric Trump, the president-elect s second son and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, will be coming to Taoyuan later this year to discuss the potential business opportunity.The dire consequences that could come from this simple phone conversation cannot be understated. The only thing less surprising than Trump s stupidity is his willingness to sacrifice the United States for his own selfish gains. His businesses and foreign financial ties have come under scrutiny for the conflicts of interest they create now that Trump is going to be president. He hasn t even been sworn in yet and already he is saying to hell with America for the sake of his own bank account.

Well, Trump only saved nearly 1,000 jobs while more than 1,000 jobs were still sent to Mexico. Oh, and Carrier got a sweet deal for it, too. Taxpayers in Indiana will be giving Carrier $7 million to keep the smattering of jobs that are left. It s a very high price to pay and is a waste of taxpayer dollars that sets the stage for more companies to do the exact same thing in order to snag millions of taxpayer dollars. All they have to do is threaten to send jobs overseas and get Trump to  negotiate  to keep some of them.In short, Trump is an easy mark for companies to exploit. But Sarah Palin is NOT supportive of what Trump is doing.In an op-ed for Young Conservatives, Palin blasted Trump s bad deal with Carrier as  crony capitalism  that will doom the free market and the country. When government steps in arbitrarily with individual subsidies, favoring one business over others, it sets inconsistent, unfair, illogical precedent,  she wrote.  Meanwhile, the invisible hand that best orchestrates a free people s free enterprise system gets amputated. Then, special interests creep in and manipulate markets. Republicans oppose this, remember? Instead, we support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail. Politicians picking and choosing recipients of corporate welfare is railed against by fiscal conservatives, for it s a hallmark of corruption. And socialism A $20 trillion debt-ridden country can t afford this sinfully stupid practice, so vigilantly guard against its continuance, or we re doomed But know that fundamentally, political intrusion using a stick or carrot to bribe or force one individual business to do what politicians insist, versus establishing policy incentivizing our ENTIRE ethical economic engine to roar back to life, isn t the answer.Trump s deal with Carrier was nothing more than a theatrical photo-op stunt designed to fool us into believing that he is saving American businesses. But he only did the exact opposite. Eventually, Carrier will threaten to send more jobs overseas and they will expect yet another government handout to be paid by taxpayers. It s free money for businesses. So businesses will likely take advantage of this and will decide to send jobs overseas in an effort to secure millions in taxpayer subsidies. It s windfall for corporations, but a costly disaster for taxpayers. Because now corporations will just hold jobs hostage and will demand taxpayer money in return for keeping just some of those jobs in the United States.Once again, Donald Trump is a loser who makes bad business deals, and this time he is dragging America down with him.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Right now, campuses are under attack because they re hotbeds for opinions and movements that politicians can t stand, and the Senate has decided to try and stop that.The bill sounds innocuous at first. It s called the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, and it s aimed at combating anti-Semitism, which has been on the rise thanks to Trump normalizing pretty much every form of bigotry there is. Combating anti-Semitism in the wake of his election through legislation is commendable.Combating it the way the Senate is doing, though, is not. What they saw in the rise of anti-Semitic sentiment and hate crimes here was not a real chance to address hate crimes and speech. They saw an opportunity to squash speech in favor of Palestinian rights in one of the places where it s strongest, and they pounced.This bill encourages the Department of Education to adopt the State Department s definition of anti-Semitism, which includes demonizing and delegitimizing Israel, applying double standards, and focusing on Israel only for human rights investigations.While the bill doesn t actually tell the Department of Education to use the language from the State Department, it does steer them in that direction. The Senate s hope seems to be that when they re investigating schools for anti-Semitic discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, they ll sanction schools with heavy anti-Israel sentiment.In fact, the definition is so broad that any speech criticizing Israel could be considered anti-Semitic hate speech, and thus, curbed lest the school get in trouble for daring to allow it.The Senate bill supposedly isn t meant to infringe on anyone s First Amendment right to criticize Israel, so long as they do it in the same way they would criticize any other nation. But we know how it ll actually be used. Groups like the Zionist Organization of America, AIPAC, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Jewish Federations of North America can t stand things like the BDS movement (boycott, divest and sanction) gaining steam. The Zionist Organization of America absolutely loves to file complaints with the Department of Education to try and silence any Palestinian rights speech on campus.That is only likely to increase if this bill becomes law. Students who fight for Palestine because Israel is guilty of murdering them for nothing, is guilty of forcing occupation and subjugating them, and is guilty of all manner of human rights abuses, already work in a heavily repressive environment. This will make that considerably worse.This has been simmering under the surface for a long time. Last year, Ted Cruz delivered a speech to AIPAC talking about how people involved with the BDS movement might end up in prison, depending on what s defined as legal and illegal protest behavior, and said that schools that support the BDS movement should lose their federal dollars.The University of California at Berkeley has faced tons of pressure to squash the BDS movement on their campus. And a student at George Washington University had campus police tell her to take a Palestinian flag out of her window.All of this is done under the idea that speech and expression in support of Palestinian rights are intimidating and frightening to Jewish students. However, a growing number of American Jews have a severe problem with how Israel abuses, oppresses and enslaves Palestine. Yes, it s a balancing act, but every right we have is a balancing act. In this case, the Senate wants to tip that balance towards censoring free speech. Do not expect them to stop there.The broader implication is that censoring pro-Palestine speech on college campuses could lead to censoring other speech on campuses. We do need to combat anti-Semitism along with other forms of hate. This, however, is just the Senate seeing their opening to end pro-Palestine speech on college campuses, likely with the hope that it ll die elsewhere.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

After all, it s the duty of the free press to get information to the people, and most Americans wanted Trump to release his tax documents.Baquet and Washington Post legend Bob Woodward both said they would risk jail by publishing Trump s taxes if they ever got possession of them.Not publishing Trump s tax returns would have been a disservice to the American people and would have basically been a cover-up on Trump s behalf.But Corey Lewandowski says that not only should the New York Times have buried the story, executive editor Dean Baquet should be put behind bars for doing his job.During a Harvard University conference on Thursday, Lewandowski attacked the media, accused the New York Times of committing a felony and said Baquet should be jailed, thus signaling that Trump and his team intend to violate the First Amendment at will when he assumes power in January.

Kellyanne, that s not what I asked,  he said.  No one is questioning the victory. I said, is it appropriate, is it responsible for the president-elect to make false statements like that. But Conway still refused to answer and chose to whine about the recounts instead. Well first, many people are questioning the victory,  Conway said.  You ve got people spending millions of dollars   wasting money and time   in the Clinton and Stein camps. So, not everyone has  accepted the election results. Conway then claimed that Trump got his information from many  different people  including anti-immigrant Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach who is an extremist conservative whack job. There s not evidence that there were millions of illegal votes,  Stephanopoulos replied.  Zero. But Conway only continued whining about the recount because whining is what she does best. There s also no evidence that a recount is going to change the results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania,  she claimed. And while that might be true, the fact that Russia hacked our election system and Trump repeatedly claimed the election is rigged makes it pretty clear that we need these recount efforts. If Conway really believes Trump legitimately won this election, she should have no objection to the recount. The only reason she would object is because she fears the recount will reveal something her and Trump do not want discovered.Stephanopoulos refused to let Conway hijack the interview and asked the question again. Simple question, Kellyanne. Is that statement by President-elect Trump true? But Conway couldn t even answer a simple question, which means these recounts should move forward. In fact, they should move forward in every state Trump  won  just to make sure his team didn t rig the results. After all, Trump did hire a man convicted of election fraud in Michigan. That alone should make people question the vote tallies.Here s the video via YouTube:Again, how Conway is able to sleep at night and look at herself in the mirror every morning after defending Trump on a daily basis is a total mystery.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

At the rally in Cincinnati, Ohio last night, Trump railed against the  extremely dishonest press  for underestimating and criticizing him, completely ignoring the fact that most of America did not want him to win.Seemingly oblivious to the fact that he lost the popular vote by MILLIONS, Trump railed against specific members of the media, such as ABC s Martha Raddatz for having an extremely emotional reaction after realizing Trump would become America s future president. Imitating Raddatz crying, Trump said: How about when a major anchor who hosted a debate started crying when she realized that we won? How about that? Tears.  No, tell me this isn t true. Trump also explained how he d been watching the shocked reactions on people s faces as he followed the election results on TV, and seemed truly amused by it. For a future leader of our country to show such a lack of respect, maturity and sensitivity to the very people he is going to be representing and leading is repulsive and should be condemned. It s truly horrifying behavior.You can watch Trump insult Americans in the video below:Trump does not have the ability to be gracious or compassionate about anything, and it s clear that there won t be much improvement in the weeks leading up to his presidency.

I think if there was any doubt that we re putting an end to one chapter in American history and moving to a new one, he dispelled that tonight. This is goodbye to American leadership in the world. Goodbye to globalization. He s bringing America home. He s going to lead a nativist, nationalistic, populist movement and if you want to join up with him fine. If you don t, forget it. Gergen said he got a  very clear impression  that Trump is going to ignore foreign policy and leave it to a team of advisers and focus on domestic policy in his  pugilistic, narcissistic way  without regard for who he hurts.Indeed, Trump s domestic policy could include dismantling Medicare and Social Security, the two most successful and popular government programs in American history. Trump also intends to attack minimum wage and give bigots the kind of freedom to discriminate against others that they haven t had in a long time. Even the Voting Rights Act, Civil Rights Act, and women s rights are going to be targeted. He s in charge,  Gergen continued.  And he has a lot of support in the Congress. That kind of speech will fire up his base, and it s going to leave a lot of other people I knew I didn t like the son of a bitch. Here s the video via YouTube. Gergen s remarks are at the three minute mark:Donald Trump s agenda needs to be obstructed at every turn over the next four years. He has no intention of uniting America or doing what s best for America. He only cares about what is best for himself and his cronies. Not a single word that comes out of his mouth is true and if our democracy is to survive, we must resist. Republicans refused to unite behind President Obama for eight years.

Wisconsin s recount is already underway, so good luck there.Michigan s recount is set to begin today, yet Trump believes that any recount in that state would be  lawless,  despite the fact that recounting election votes is as American as hot dogs with ketchup at the ballpark. His complaint could stall that recount until it becomes impossible to do it, and that s probably his goal. The Board of Canvassers is scheduled to discuss Trump s specious claims today.In Pennsylvania, Trump s attorneys accused Jill Stein of  commandeering Pennsylvania s electoral process, with an eye toward doing the same to the Electoral College.  They go on to say that there s no evidence of fraud or tampering, and imply that the recount shouldn t happen because of this. Indeed, one judge has blocked recount efforts in one part of the state, but it s not clear what the state itself will do.What are they so afraid of? Seriously. Trump himself alleged massive voter fraud, and his minions have glommed on to that absurd narrative, but they won. They won the White House, so what s the problem here? If anything, they ought to be celebrating these recounts because they should believe such recounts will just reinforce the legitimacy of Trump s win.Is it the anomalies in Wisconsin that s scaring the living demons out of him? Perhaps it s his shrinking margin in Pennsylvania that s got him terrified. Following Philadelphia s final tally, Trump s lead shrank from roughly 71,000 to 46,435 votes. That could be scary. Or maybe it s the fact that Michigan agreed to a recount despite the fact that the state only uses paper ballots.Hillary is now down by less than 80,000 votes across all three battleground states.The problems in all three states could be enough to worry him. If he were any kind of classy, though, he d tell them to go ahead with their recounts, and he d have his people tell the press and anyone else who will listen that he s confident these recounts won t reveal anything new.That should be obvious.

One is Rex Tillerson, the current CEO of ExxonMobil, and the other, Lee Raymond, is the former CEO of ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil is our biggest oil giant.How bloody fantastic is that? Putting Big Oil in charge of the Department of State, arguably the most important cabinet position there is. There could be any number of reasons for this, but Trump s insistence that we should have taken Iraq s oil is one that comes to mind.That s not very likely, though. ExxonMobil is partnered with Rosneft, Russia s state-owned oil company. So ultimately, Putin is in charge of Rosneft and ExxonMobil is Putin s partner. It could be that Trump is trying to tie us more closely to Russia, and that seems far more plausible.It s also entirely possible Trump thinks he might be able to use the Department of State to further his own business interests if he nominates a CEO, although the CEO of an oil company isn t exactly who we d think of if this were the case. Not to mention that he d be putting someone in a position that could potentially be abused for the purpose of furthering their own business interests abroad.Tillerson supports the idea of man-made climate change, and ExxonMobil s position on the Paris climate accord is favorable. However, Tillerson also made more than $25 million last year, so there s another wealthy business insider to build that levee on Trump s swamp higher so it floods, rather than drains.Trump kicked off his victory tour today by saying  America first,  in an Indiana speech. Perhaps he s deluded himself into thinking that expanding his search for a Secretary of State to Big Oil executives is exactly that. However, it doesn t really mesh well with what everyday Americans thought he meant when he said,  America first.  It smacks of serious cronyism.Filling his cabinet with wealthy Wall Street financiers, CEOs, and Washington insiders is the polar opposite of what he campaigned on. There s no telling what an ExxonMobil CEO would do as Secretary of State. There s no telling whether he d even be able to do the job.

According to data compiled by EverytownResearch.org, more than a quarter of those shootings were fatal   a total of 56 officers were killed and 203 were injured in these 200 shootings.The Huffington Post reported Thursday: Sixty-nine of these shootings have taken place in states with background-check laws on all handgun sales. These states employ 337,679 full-time sworn police officers. In states without these laws, which employ 299,355 officers, there have been 131 shootings of law enforcement officers.Twenty-one of the 25 states with the highest number of shooting incidents per police officer don t have background checks on all handgun sales, a HuffPost analysis shows.Seventy-five percent of the firearms used in this year s police shootings   151 total guns  were handguns. According to statistics compiled by the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, the total number of officer-related deaths are up from 2014 and have more than doubled from 2015, with Texas being the deadliest state for officers. In Texas alone, 18 officers have been shot and killed, including those who died tragically in the ambush in Dallas on July 7th. Day and night, police officers run toward danger to keep the rest of us safe, and this tragic milestone is a sobering reminder of the risks they face,  said John Feinblatt, Everytown s president.  We have to reduce those risks, and data shows that we can   by making it harder for criminals to get guns. It s long past time to close the dangerous loophole in our laws that lets criminals buy guns with no background check and no questions asked. Licensed gun dealers are required by Federal law to perform background checks on buyers, however, unlicensed dealers, such as individuals who sell weapons online or at gun shows, are not bound by the same Federal law, thus allowing anyone   regardless of their mental health or criminal history   to purchase firearms, endangering the lives of millions.Looking at this further, currently, only 18 states require background checks for handgun purchases and out of those, only 8 require universal background checks for all firearms. Out of those few states that require background checks, Everytown data shows that officers in those states are 48 percent less likely to be killed with handguns. That is astounding!The data strongly suggests that expanding background checks and enforcing them in all states would save countless lives, yet the NRA strongly opposes this insisting that laws don t stop criminals from getting guns. While there is SOME logic in this, a large percentage of shootings (not just officer related) were committed by licensed gun owners. A study done of four concealed carry states in 2016 showed that 302 shooting deaths were committed by licensed owners   74 in Florida, 51 in Texas, 33 in Ohio and 19 in Washington.The NRA refused to comment on these studies, stating that they needed  more information  about how the research was conducted, but Sarah Tofte, Everytown s research director, said the group is  confident  in its research methods. The factors that contribute to these shootings are complicated, and no single policy can explain all of the variation,  she told HuffPost.  That said, we know from other research that background checks do save lives, and states owe it to their first responders to do everything in their power to protect them. It s very clear and simple   if more states require universal background checks, the chance of police officer shootings will reduce by more than 50 percent.

Furthermore, Mnuchin took advantage of the financial crisis in 2008 just like Trump did and made millions of dollars foreclosing on families  homes through his establishment of OneWest Bank during the collapse.And one foreclosure, in particular, makes it clear that ordinary Americans should not trust Mnuchin because he ll only serve himself instead of serving the people.According to Politico,Two years ago, OneWest filed foreclosure papers on the Lakeland, Florida, home of Ossie Lofton, who had taken a reverse mortgage, a loan that supplies cash to elderly homeowners and doesn t require monthly payments.After confusion over insurance coverage, a OneWest subsidiary sent Lofton a bill for $423.30. She sent a check for $423. The bank sent another bill, for 30 cents. Lofton, 90, sent a check for 3 cents. In November 2014, the bank foreclosed.In October, lawyers at the nonprofit Florida Rural Legal Services contested OneWest s foreclosure and asked the Polk County Circuit Court for a jury trial. I don t know that they re the worst, but I certainly think it s criminal the way these servicers are treating elderly homeowners,  said Lynn Drysdale, an attorney representing Lofton.Seriously?! This vulture literally tried to take an elderly person s home away from them over 27 cents. This is a guy who literally accrued an estimated net worth of $40 million at Goldman Sachs, yet he greedily refused to forgive 27 cents. Mnuchin could have just pulled a quarter and two pennies out of his pocket to cover the extra amount himself and he wouldn t have missed it at all. Targeting an elderly woman like that is just evil.And that s not the only evil thing Mnuchin has done to other people to line his own pockets.OneWest Bank withheld $14,332,160 from Sandy Hook victims when they needed the money the most to rebuild their homes and businesses. And after his bank merged with another to become CIT Bank, it was accused of discriminating against black and Latino customers.In short, Donald Trump is letting a vulture capitalist take the reigns of the Treasury Department and is doubling down on conservative economic policies that caused the Great Recession in the first place.

There s no such thing, unfortunately, anymore of facts. And so Mr. Trump s tweet amongst a certain crowd, a large   a large part of the population, are truth. When he says that millions of people illegally voted, he has some   in his   amongst him and his supporters, and people believe they have facts to back that up. Those that do not like Mr. Trump, they say that those are lies, and there s no facts to back it up. Hughes  comments did not sit well with Politico correspondant Glenn Thrush, who proceeded to school her. First I ve got to pick my jaw up off the floor here,  he began. There are no objective facts? I mean, that is   that is an absolutely outrageous assertion. Of course there are facts. There is no widespread proof that three million people voted illegally. It s been checked over and over again. We had a Pew study that took place over 15 years that showed people had more likelihood of being struck by lightning than voting illegally in an election. Facts are facts. I m sorry you don t like the facts. Indeed, while conservatives are using edited videos and things they heard on social media as proof of their claims, fact-checking organization Politifact did their homework and found exactly where Donald Trump got his claim that three million people voted illegally. It turns out he got it from conspiracy theorist Alex Jone s InfoWars, which got their numbers from some guy who claimed to be affiliated with VoteFraud.org. But there is no report from that organization and the guy refused to provide evidence to support his dubious claim, which was rated false by Politifact.So Hughes was talking out of her ass when she attacked facts. Thrush, on the other hand, was absolutely right. A comprehensive study of voter fraud found only 31 cases out of 1 billion votes cast from 2000 to 2014. Donald Trump is wrong. Conservatives are wrong. And Scottie Nell Hughes should be ashamed of herself.Featured Image: YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

People that I m looking at that Trump has appointed or nominated have all been top of the class, number one in their field, extremely talented, great leaders on their own,  she said.Of course, any reasonable person with a functioning brain understands that Trump has been scraping the bottom of the conservative barrel to fill government positions. After all, no one can say with a straight face that Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions is the best attorney in the country.And no one can say that Sarah Palin is even remotely qualified to be Secretary of anything, much less Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Trump s pick to run the Department of Education, Betsy DeVos, is staunchly anti-public schools and funds a group that wants to dismantle child labor laws because mining would be  exciting  for kids. In other words, she is definitely unqualified to shape the future of education in this country.But when the subject of protests against Trump came up, Camerota was flooded with idiocy spearheaded by Johnson. Voting is a privilege in this country and you need to be legal, not like California where three million illegals voted,  she claimed. Where are you getting your information?  a confused Camerota asked.Johnson claimed she got the information from the media, including CNN, which means Johnson probably took reports on Trump s tweet about 3 million people voting illegally for Hillary Clinton as the truth because the media reported on it.Johnson repeatedly insisted that California let 3 million undocumented immigrants vote and claimed that President Obama encouraged them to vote. All of the panelists agreed, with one even daring Camerota to  Google it  because it s on Facebook. Well, Camerota did and found that Fox Business deceptively edited a clip of President Obama to make it sound like he encouraged undocumented immigrants to vote when, in fact, he did not.But that didn t sway Johnson from continuing to insist that California allows undocumented immigrants to vote, which caused Camerota to smack her own head in frustration because the stupid was clearly strong in this one.Here s the video via YouTube.Seriously, Donald Trump claim about 3 million illegal voters has been thoroughly debunked and has been trashed by members of his own party because it is so absurd. This segment proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Trump supporters are completely ignorant and have been brainwashed to believe anything that Trump says.

They are also not racist like the KKK because Black Lives Matter is inclusive and works with law enforcement.It s true that some protesters go too far by rioting and looting, but most of the time they are unaffiliated with the group.So when Lahren appeared on the Daily Show for an interview with Trevor Noah on Wednesday night, the fireworks were sure to fly but Lahren was the one who got burned. For somebody who is not racist, you have to spend a lot of time saying  I am not racist,  Noah pointed out. Lahren responded by labeling Black Lives Matter as a group of cop killers who are violent and racist against white people just because of the actions of a few people who claimed to be with Black Lives Matter.Noah struck back by hitting Lahren with her own words.  You re the same person who argued on your show that just because Donald Trump has supporters from the KKK doesn t mean he s in the KKK,  he said.As Lahren tried to defend herself by trashing black people, the crowd repeatedly gasped in shock, including when Lahren said she doesn t see color. But she also claimed that a black man is  18.5 times more likely to shoot a police officer than a police officer is to shoot a black man. However, it should be pointed out that white people kill more police officers than black people do.Anyway, Noah quipped that Lahren must have trouble at traffic lights since she doesn t see color and went on to say that  how we treat color is more important. Noah then took Lahren to the woodshed for calling Black Lives Matter the  new KKK  by pointing out that the KKK still exists and that it s  incendiary  to make such a claim knowing the acts of terrorism and murder the KKK has committed.Lahren then blindly compared Black Lives Matter to the KKK again by blaming protesters for looting and burning before asking,  What did the KKK do?  which shocked the audience and Noah.  Did you say,  What did the KKK do?  Noah asked in disbelief.  Wow. Lahren then embarrassed herself by ranting about San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick s refusal to stand during the national anthem and suggested that she s being criticized for attacking him because she is white. So because I don t disagree with what he did, I should shut up?  she asked Noah.  Because I m white so I should shut up? I shouldn t be able to talk about black issues  cause I m white? But again, Noah was able to humiliate Lahren with her own words. No one brought up whites at all I never said that. I don t see color.

Already, it looks like he will not only have to contend with resistance from the Democrats   he ll have to fight with the Republican Party as well! Politico reports that GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake are teaming up with Democrats to create legislation that would protect approximately 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from one of Trump s deportation schemes. In reference to Trump s threat to deport undocumented immigrants that were given protection and work permits under a 2012 executive order issued by President Barack Obama, Politico reported: But should Trump follow through on that promise, some key lawmakers on Capitol Hill want to make sure those protections stay in place for the immigrants who willingly gave personal information to the federal government and went through background checks. One big fear among advocates is that the Trump administration could use that personal information to track down the immigrants to deport them. Graham, who has been a massive critic of Trump since day one, commented on the legislation and said: The worst outcome is to repeal the legal status that these kids have. Whether you agree with them having it or not, they ve come out of the shadows. [The legislation is] going to be basically, if you have legal status, you ll continue legal status. I think it would pass overwhelmingly. Of course, we can t be sure that Trump will actually sign this into law when he s President, as this legislation likely won t be up for discussion until next year.

Yes, she filed the petition and yes, she paid the fee, but the state needed to do this even without Stein s request. A new analysis in the Washington Post discovered significant voting anomalies in several wards.Trump now leads Hillary by just over 22,000 votes in Wisconsin. The WaPo analysis didn t look at precincts or counties   they looked at wards, which are the smallest unit where votes are counted. This helped create a more detailed picture of what s happening there.Walter Mebane, an associate researcher at the Center for Political Studies and a professor of political science and statistics at the University of Michigan, looked at small wards that used optical scanning technology, and found that certain features in the vote tabulations reveal the possibility that these counts were tampered with.For instance, using a method called  last digit diagnostics,  Mebane found that the tabulations he looked at should have last digits that, when averaged together, show a mean of around 4.5. Lower could mean that the counts were manipulated.In the small wards he looked at where optical scanning tech was used, the last digit diagnostics reveal a mean average much lower than 4.5.Another statistic Mebane looked at was how often the last digit of a vote tabulation was zero, or five. If there are no problems, then the mean average of that variable should be around 0.2. Larger could mean someone was sloppy, and smaller could mean votes were manipulated.In these small wards, that number was significantly smaller than .2 for Hillary, meaning that the vote counts show a last digit of zero or five far less often than they should.He also found evidence of something called  signaling  in the tabulations, which is when fraudsters leave a type of trail that more or less claims credit for the fraud. Mebane points out that this is actually a fairly common tactic amongst fraudsters in Russia.Finally, a simple test revealed something called  multimodality,  which could show that someone was receiving fraudulent votes. These small wards exhibited that anomaly, too.None of this is absolute proof of election fraud or vote fraud in Wisconsin, and Mebane is careful to note that. However, it gives credence to the need for a recount, whatever Jill Stein s motivations are. If nothing else, conducting a thorough recount will lend further legitimacy to our democratic process or concretely reveal problems that need to be fixed. It might also serve to weaken Trump s efforts to undermine our democracy by repeatedly crying  FRAUD!! FRAUD EVERYWHERE!!

People who occasionally need help from the government have long been demonized by Republicans. It s assumed that somehow, just because someone is poor, they are somehow pulling something on the rest of us. Clearly, that makes no sense at all, but the stereotype lives on. Most predominantly, Republicans insist that poor people must, just must, have substance abuse problems, so before being given the most paltry sustenance possible, they must be tested. That s what Michigan is doing. They are drug testing some welfare recipients. Guess how many positive results came up? None, not a single one.This wasn t done on a particularly large scale. Republicans passed a new law two years ago that allowed the state to drug test any welfare recipients that might be suspected of drug abuse. After the law passed, Michigan did one intelligent thing: they tested it. For one year beginning in October of 2015, they tested 27 potential substance abusers out of 443 welfare recipients.DHHS conducted the pilot in Allegan, Clinton and Marquette counties between Oct. 1, 2015, and Sept. 30, 2016, the report said.Although a total of 443 people in those counties were either receiving or applied for cash assistance during those 12 months, previous court decisions limited the actual drug-testing to individuals who failed a substance-abuse screening test.The report said that 27 of the 443 people were identified as potential substance-abusers. Of those 27, 10 were already getting treatment through Community Mental Health, three had their cases closed for other reasons and 14 went through the screening test.Source: Michigan LiveOne of those tested  was found by a clinician to have a reasonable suspicion of use of a controlled substance and require a substance use test.  The person agreed to the test, but the case, for some reason, was closed prior to the test. Not a single other person even raised a red flag.These results are hardly surprising. In states where they have enacted drug testing for welfare recipients, the results have been similar.It s doubtful these results will do much. Republicans feel that poor people must be punished, that any assistance must be micromanaged, while corporate welfare needs no oversight whatsoever.In 2015, despite lack of evidence that programs in other states accomplished their goals, three more states have implemented similar regimes. And a ThinkProgress survey of the 10 states that now have these programs in place found that they continue to be expensive and not especially effective. All told, states spent another $850,909.25 on the testing regimes in 2015 to uncover just 321 positive tests in more than one state, none at all.This came after a February 2015 ThinkProgress examination of the seven states that had implemented drug testing programs for TANF applicants and/or recipients. At that time, those states had spent about $1 million to create and implement a complicated system of screening and urine testing and found just 407 drug users.In other words, this supposedly fiscally conservative position is not at all about saving money. It s expensive and punitive.

He thinks of this as creativity. Gingrich went on to say how Trump has used social media to get regular Americans to attack the media for going after real issues. In other words, he believes Trump has come up with this amazing solution to the media exposing truths he doesn t want exposed. President-elect Trump s ability to communicate directly to the American people when he wants to through Facebook, through Twitter, through a variety of mechanisms that aren t traditional gives him an ability to communicate and build on majority unlike any president we have seen up until now and I suspect he will continue to use it.He is not going to fall into allowing the elite media to define who he is and allowing them to censor what the American people learned.

While it s true that he spent the morning tweeting about getting out of his business entirely, he will very likely get this break, which puts those millions in his pockets, before he actually divests (if he actually divests).Trump, Ivanka, and his two sons together own Trump Old Post Office, LLC., and the tax break comes from the  Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits  program, which provides breaks to companies and investors that rehab historic properties.Ordinarily, this would be something we might mutter and mumble over, because really, does Trump need a tax credit of any kind? We might have muttered and mumbled a little louder if this had happened before he was elected, too. But now, with him actually being the president-elect, and the Park Service technically working for him even if not officially, there s a major problem.They just gave their new employer a break on his taxes.Trump s lease on the Old Post Office strictly prohibits  any elected official of the Government of the United States,  from participating. The General Services Administration would be wise to break their contract if Trump doesn t disappear from that hotel post-haste.A professor of government procurement at the George Washington University School of Law agrees that this is a massive conflict of interest: This is a classic or textbook example of a conflict of interest. The decision-maker here, the National Park Service, works for the party that stands to benefit from a favorable decision. Trump s announcement that he s going to divest himself of his business interests entirely does little to change this, because he s still insisting that his kids will run his empire for him. Generally, placing assets in a blind trust means turning them over to someone who has no direct involvement with you, let alone the relationship of parent and child.Divesting means getting out of them completely.Trump doesn t seem to have any intention of doing either, given that his children are top members of his transition team. He does plan to hold a news conference in two weeks where he ll supposedly give details of his divestiture. That will also give them time to actually figure out how to extricate him from all his businesses.That doesn t stop the fact that he s set to get a massive tax break very soon, possibly before he s fully divested (if that s even his plan). $32 million is not pocket change to the average American taxpayer, and it doesn t look good going into the president s own pocket.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

My son told me that [the teacher] threw my son into a wall,  Jackson explained.  My son had dreams about it all last night. He s still shaking in his sleep, saying that he keeps having visions of [the teacher] throwing him into a wall. Jackson said that her son s jaw was broken and two of his teeth were knocked out in the violent assault.Timothy Randall Korr, who is employed by the Baltimore Curriculum Project charter operation, has been identified as the child s abuser. Korr claims that the child was being  disruptive  and said he was taking the boy to the principal s office when the attack occurred, which he described as  a mistake. The teacher told me that he put him over his shoulder, and when he put him down he was bleeding,  Jackson recalled.  That s it. How can you tell somebody like that? He said he made a mistake. He said,  I made a mistake. It was a mistake.  That s what he said. Child abuse detectives got a warrant for Korr s arrest after watching the disturbing footage of the appalling incident that had been caught by a security camera. On Wednesday, the Baltimore Curriculum Project announced that Korr had been fired. We are heartsick that this child suffered this injury,  the group said in a statement.  We pray for his complete and quick recovery and for his family as well.

Unfortunately, these bigotry-fueled attacks haven t died down since the post-election chaos, and Trump supporters are still leaving their mark on this country in the most vile of ways.Recently, a white Trump supporter in Florida was charged with battery for attacking a Hispanic man. As if that wasn t disturbing enough, the man personally dedicated the attack to his President-elect, putting into perspective just how dangerous Trump s divisive campaign rhetoric was.According to the police report, Caleb Joseph Illig drove into the parking lot at a Gate Food Post store in Gainsville at around 1:10 a.m. The victim, Pablo Echevarria, had been cleaning the parking lot when he was brutally attacked by Illig, who shouted  Let s Trump down  as he started punching Echevarria in the back of the head. When Echevarria asked Illig why he was being attacked, Illig uttered these terrifying words: This is for Donald Trump. According to the charging document, Echevarria didn t fight back and instead tried to prevent further injury by using  evasive movements. Echevarria was rescued from further attack when another employee got involved and Illig fled. After the attack, Echevarria told police that he was experiencing pain in the back of his head and neck, although it is not clear if he was treated for these injuries.When police checked the security cameras to check Echevarria s claims, they found that the footage clearly shows [Illig] striking [Echevarria] in the back of the head, and completely corroborates the [victim] and [witness ] accounts of the incident. When Illig was confronted about the incident, he told police officers that he had no recollection of the incident whatsoever  and tried to blame his disgusting behavior on a mental disorder and alcohol. He has only been charged with simple battery.Noting that this was a politically-motivated hate crime, Officer Ben Tobias commented on the effects of the election on the community: Just looking at election results, the community is divided almost 50/50. It s not just here in Gainesville. I d like to think we re doing better, but we re having our own problems crop up.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""There are all kinds of pushes designed to stop Trump from officially taking office in January. There s a petition on Change.org with over four million signatures calling on electors to make Hillary president. A recount effort is underway in three crucial battleground states. There are calls for investigations into his conflicts of interest, which could be unconstitutional and could prevent him from legally taking office.And now, a group of electors has gotten together to start raising money for  a three-week mad dash to stop Donald Trump s election.  It s true that these are Democratic electors, but their goal is to successfully lobby enough of their Republican counterparts to put someone ahem sane into the White House.The group is calling itself the Hamilton Electors, presumably after founding father Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton described both the need and the purpose of the Electoral College in  Federalist No. 68  as the following: [The Electoral College] affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. Trump is eminently unqualified for the office of the president, and yet he won the necessary electoral votes. Therefore, if we look at what Hamilton said, our electors are obligated to reject Donald Trump and choose someone else.It s not yet clear what the Hamilton Electors will actually do with the money they raise, but their endgame is clear: Stop Trump in any legal way possible. They have already registered a 527 non-profit organization, and Colorado Democratic elector Michael Baca and his compatriots are looking to replace Trump with a more mainstream Republican.Wait, what? Why a mainstream Republican? Because as much as it should go to Hillary given the popular vote totals, the electors they have to convince to reject Trump are never going to do it if their alternative is a Democrat, and especially if it s Hillary. A mainstream Republican, such as John Kasich, is an alternative that many Republicans could probably get behind. This, however, means convincing Democratic electors in addition to Republican electors.Someone like Kasich could do a lot to halt the progress we ve made over the last 8 years, but he s sane, at the very least. He also won t be flying off the handle on Twitter at every single last perceived slight. He has his problems, but at least we can be reasonably sure the country will survive to see 2020.Under Trump ? There s a lot less of a guarantee, especially with Congressional leaders signaling that they re ready to work with him. And, as some are pointing out, the electors have an obligation to ensure that we don t put a demagogue into the White House. And there is currently no law or precedent preventing the College from choosing its own candidate.There have been no overt signs that Republican electors will get behind the Hamilton Electors, however, the Democratic coalition says they re getting through to at least some of them. Even a split vote, where Trump doesn t get 270 electoral votes on Dec. 19, might help because that would send it to Congress and they d have the final say.Unfortunately, they d probably choose Trump anyway.If someone else, like Kasich, Mitt Romney, or another mainstream Republican managed to get 270 electoral votes, there would likely be some serious problems. That s particularly true for Trump voters, the RNC, and Congress. The chances that the Hamilton Electors will succeed in their efforts are slim, but at least we have a group in the Electoral College that s trying.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He said he d release them if he won, but so far, crickets. It s not a giant leap to imagine that Trump has something either incriminating or simply something bad in his taxes. Would Trump have run for president if he knew a little known law that makes every single presidential tax return go through an automatic audit?The last time we had a known tax evader in office was during the Richard Nixon administration. His Vice President, Spiro Agnew, was forced to resign in 1973 after pleading guilty to tax evasion. Nixon himself was twice audited by the IRS. In 1974, he had to pay $465,000 worth of back taxes for a three year period.After that, Nixon made all his tax returns public. Since then, all but Gerald Ford, and now Trump, have. The IRS even passed a law requiring that all sitting presidents and vice presidents are audited every year. The requirement for mandatory audits of the tax returns of the president and vice president dates back to the Watergate era in the 1970s,  the IRS said in a statement to McClatchy, noting that non-partisan career employees adopted the requirement.  Since then, this provision has remained in place during both Republican and Democratic administrations as well as under IRS Commissioners appointed by both parties. Source: McClatchyBefore you get too excited, the law also specifically outlines how the President s and Vice President s taxes are handled: in special orange folders, in a secure area and with confidentiality. In other words, if Trump isn t breaking laws, we still won t be able to see his tax returns.There is a chance that Trump could get the law overturned: I don t believe there is anything that would prevent the president from   instructing that this precautionary measure of the IRS audits be rescinded,  said Norman Eisen, who as special counsel to the Obama White House during the first term put in place new ethics guidelines.  He could theoretically do it. Trump could even go beyond having that law overturned. Many Republicans want to abolish the IRS altogether, which is a stupid idea, one which would surely bankrupt the country, but Donald Trump has shown himself to be thin-skinned and completely self-interested.

One might expect even the most supportive Republicans to jump on him for that too, since they re all about upholding our democracy, and making claims of massive fraud in an election undermines public confidence in democracy. They re suspiciously silent, though, except for a few.Surprisingly, one of those few is one of Trump s biggest fanboys, Newt Gingrich. He s spoken out against Trump before, sure, but not very often, not very loudly, and not like this: The president of the United States can t randomly tweet without having somebody check it out, It makes you wonder about whatever else he s doing. It undermines much more than just a single tweet. So I d say that s probably the biggest single thing he s done wrong.  [emphasis mine]No, we re not fans of Newt Gingrich, but we are fans of this because he s right: It does make you wonder what Trump is doing that none of us can see. What he s cooking up behind the scenes. How he really sees the world, which has been a point of endless speculation. Things of that nature.Nobody else put it this way, though. Other critics were more conventional in their criticism of Trump s tweet about election fraud. They re saying he needs evidence before making that claim, which is also true. Lindsey Graham, one of Trump s most vocal and vicious critics despite also being a Republican, blasted the specific nature of that tweet: You are now the president-elect of the United States. If you really believe that millions of people voted illegally, you should have some proof. Because your voice is not just an ordinary voice. However, others, including John McCain, just said they weren t going to weigh in on this. John Cornyn of Texas even said he s got bigger things to worry about, and from his point of view, that very well may be true. However, it s important to note that Trump actively undermined the people s faith in democracy all through his campaign by crying that everything was rigged against him.In doing that, he made us vulnerable to becoming a dictatorship, the one thing Republicans seem to fear the most. That s what makes this important.Now that he s won, none of that none of the recount efforts, nor the popular vote should matter much to him. But there he is, on Twitter, bitching up a dark, smelly cloud about election fraud to try and bolster his own political legitimacy when it all should be tiny potatoes to him now.

Despite the fact that Pence was not offended and did not want an apology, Trump railed against the cast for days, causing his rabid supporters to call for a boycott.It turns out, Trump and his supporters got a brutal reality check today. Hamilton, the Broadway show that Trump called  overrated  in one of his tweets, just broke a record for ticket sales. Guess the #BoycottHamilton movement didn t really have the effect Trump and his minions had hoped!TwitterHamilton shattered the Broadway record for the most money made in a single week, selling $3.3 million in tickets. The last time any Broadway show came close to this was in 2013, when Wicked sold $3.2 million in a nine-show week. Hamilton only had eight shows, and it still surpassed Wicked. And that s not all. According to the New York Times, whom Trump also attacks regularly, this also happened: [Hamilton] set a record for the highest premium ticket price charged by a Broadway box office   $998   although some people have paid more buying tickets from resellers. TwitterTwitterIt just goes to show that although Trump, Pence and their moronic supporters want to set this country back several decades, that s not what the majority of the country wants. When the Hamilton cast spoke about freedom, diversity, and equality, those are the values that resonate with most of us. The outpouring of support that Hamilton has received since the #HamiltonBoycott proves that the majority of the country does not agree with Trump (after all, he lost the popular vote by MILLIONS) and his bigotry has no place in America.Featured image via Alex Wong and Facebook""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Trump s pick for attorney general has seriously said that children with disabilities attending public schools are the problem with America s education system.In May 2000, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), gave a speech about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act on the floor of the Senate. He argued that one of the main reasons public schools in America are failing miserably at educating our children is because kids with disabilities have been mainstreamed. We have created a complex system of federal regulations and laws that have created lawsuit after lawsuit, special treatment for certain children, and that are a big factor in accelerating the decline in civility and discipline in classrooms all over America. I say that very sincerely,  Sessions said.Sessions insisted that he had received letters from teachers all over the country who said they weren t allowed to properly discipline troubled or disruptive students because of the Disabilities Education Act. We have children we cannot control because of this federal law,  he said.As the Huffington Post explains: The law, which passed in 1975, was enacted to protect children with disabilities from the school administrators that Sessions cited. It required schools to grant students with disabilities an education in a general classroom when possible, and encouraged the parents of those children to be more intimately involved in their education. The legislation, which has been reformed various times since, is credited with providing millions of children with mainstream public school access and support. Sessions could care less that education advocates, even from his own state, have made it clear that the only way they have been abe to get fair treatment for disabled students is through federal regulations and the threat of lawsuits.According to Candace Aylor, a veteran parent advocate and appointee to Texas  health commission s Behavioral Health Advisory Committee, Session s arguments are not only nauseating, they are heartless and misguided. If he doesn t recognize the need for schools to be required to provide a free and appropriate public education to all students regardless of disability what kind of society does he intend for us to live in?  she said.  What should we do? Should we put them in asylums again? How far back in history should we go? Are they not worthy? Are they defective in his mind? It isn t likely that Trump gives a hoot that his choice for attorney general thinks we should keep children with disabilities hidden in a back room and not waste our precious time educating them. After all, Trump himself thinks it is perfectly acceptable to mock people with disabilities.Featured image via Active For Life""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Donald J.

What is wrong with a penalty for burning the American flag?  Varney asked. Two Supreme Court opinions that say I can burn my flag, I can t burn yours,  Napolitano replied.  Burning the American flag is a form of protected freedom of speech as reprehensible as it is, as demonstrative of a hatred of American values as it is   I fully agree with the president-elect on that. But you cannot prosecute for it. The reason I chuckled is the penalty of stripping citizenship has been prohibited in the United States of America since 1789! Varney suggested that Trump could just  get a new Supreme Court and get a different ruling,  but Napolitano fired back. Get a different constitution! Rather than the one in which he was elected president. People cannot be prosecuted for expressing unpopular opinions. A giddy Varney warned,  Not yet. Here s the video via YouTube.What Trump is calling for would even make deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative hero, spin in his grave.During a 2012 interview, Scalia said that punishing Americans for flag burning is something that a king would do. If I were king, I wouldn t go about letting people burn the American flag,  Scalia told Piers Morgan.  However, we have a First Amendment which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged, and it is addressed, in particular to speech critical of the government. I mean, that was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress. Burning the flag is a form of expression. Here s the video via YouTube.So by trying to punish Americans for expressing themselves, Trump would be acting like the tyrannical king conservatives have accused President Obama of being for the last eight years.

Gergel of Federal District Court in Charleston declared Roof competent to stand on Friday. Jury selection had been put on hold for three weeks after the defense team asked the judge to declare Roof incompetent due to mental defect. But a psychiatric evaluation found that Roof was able to assist in his defense and understood the consequences of the proceedings. Therefore, under the law, he was ruled competent.On Monday, things took a surprise turn when Roof petitioned the court to allow him to represent himself. Gergel advised Roof against firing his legal team, which is led by David I. Bruck, a noted capital defense attorney. The judge asked the defendant a series of questions to make sure he understood the ramifications of his actions. But ultimately, after having found Roof competent, Gergel had no choice but to honor Roof s Sixth Amendment right to act as his own attorney. I do find the defendant has the personal capacity to self-representation,  Judge Gergel said.  I continue to believe it is strategically unwise, but it is a decision you have the right to make. Although Roof will be taking the lead role in his defense, Brock and the rest of his legal team will continue to serve as standby counsel.  Jury selection has since resumed.Roof is accused of killing nine African American people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., on June 17, 2015. He reportedly mingled with his victims for an hour, sitting in on their bible study where they welcomed him with open arms. He then began shouting racial slurs and pulled out a Glock pistol from his fanny pack. He opened fire on his unsuspecting victims, killing the pastor of the church, three other ministers and five other members of the congregation.Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, warned of the troubles defendants face when they represent themselves, especially if they have a mental illness. Key issues never get raised because the defendant knows nothing about the law,  said Dunham.  And often with mentally ill defendants whose murders were a product of their mental illness, they will attempt to justify their conduct instead of presenting evidence that their mental illness makes them less culpable. Abraham Lincoln said,  He who represents himself has a fool for a client.  While that may be true, it can also be particularly traumatic for the family when a defendant accused of slaughtering their loved ones is acting as his own attorney, as Dunham explained. When an emotionally disturbed defendant is permitted to cross-examine those witnesses and ask questions that may be based on a delusional view of reality, it only makes things worse,  Mr. Dunham said.Featured image via Grace Beahm-Pool/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The Democratic Party is in shards on the floor right now. I think we re going to have eight years of Trump and his clean-shaven looters scraping out the carcass of the country before fucking off and blaming it on progressives and lesbians and PC and rap music.Oswalt talks about the schadenfreude that seems to be resonating throughout Trump-i-verse. People, according to Oswalt, are telling the comedian that his type of comedy is over and now we have to be subjected to whatever Trumpsters call comedy. Obviously, Oswalt had the perfect answer for that:So many alt-righters (or just people on the right) are failed or frustrated comedians. Just as so many far, far left wingers are. Comedy is too PC! It s not PC enough! It s racist! It shames white men! IT DOESN T FIT TO MY STANDARDS, SO THEREFORE I MUST DESTROY IT!Being funny isn t something everyone is born with, and even the ones born with it have to work and evolve and have humility while they do so. For the untalented but still entitled, there s a gut full of envy to carry around when they see other people getting laughs where they can t.Oswalt went further and compared these times to the rise of the Nazis. He referenced an essay by Clive James, about Egon Friedall, an intellectual who committed suicide before being hauled off by the Nazis.Egon threw himself from his window as the SA men battered down his door, screaming,  Watch out! Get out of the way!  to the pedestrians as he plummeted.I think   I m guessing, I know   that Egon sensed something even MORE sinister behind the Nazi uprising. Something fueled not by nationalism or racial pride but by bog-standard showbiz envy.Here s the post in its entirety. It s definitely worth reading and sharing:It s an interesting perspective and if you think about it, conservatism, not just Trumpism, is based on envy. Conservatives are envious of people who have more talent, they are envious of people who they think are getting more attention. They are even envious of those who have much, much less than them.Conservatives try comedy again and again, and with the exception of just a few (like Tim Allen or Larry the Cable Guy), they nearly always fail. Their comedy, like their policies, is mean-spirited. Conservatives punch down while liberals speak truth to power. When conservatives fail, their envy leads to anger. More than anything, though, Trump has made being thin-skinned fashionable. Trump supporters, even after winning, think they are the consummate victims. When victimhood is given power, things can get very dangerous.

We know that this moment fills Cubans   in Cuba and in the United States   with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him. Today, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. In the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.President Obama s statement was much different from Donald Trump s, which seemed to celebrate Castro s death. Indeed, Trump s statement is the kind of dangerous reaction that could damage international relations between nations at a time when we should be seeking peace.Republicans, of course, have been attacking President Obama ever since. Marco Rubio called Obama s statement  pathetic.  Ted Cruz says the United States should not send anyone to represent America at the funeral.But once again, just like they did when President Obama did not attend former First Lady Nancy Reagan s funeral, Republicans are conveniently forgetting history and precedent.As it turns out, the Republicans themselves sent condolences after a brutal dictator died on two occasions. In 1953, President Eisenhower offered condolences upon learning that Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was near death.At this moment in history when multitudes of Russians are anxiously concerned because of the illness of the Soviet ruler2 the thoughts of America go out to all the people of the U.S.S.R. the men and women, the boys and girls in the villages, cities, farms and factories of their homeland.They are the children of the same God who is the Father of all peoples everywhere. And like all peoples, Russia s millions share our longing for a friendly and peaceful world.Regardless of the identity of government personalities, the prayer of us Americans continues to be that the Almighty will watch over the people of that vast country and bring them, in His wisdom, opportunity to live their lives in a world where all men and women and children dwell in peace and comradeship.That s right. Republicans sent condolences for a brutal dictator who murdered at least 10 million people and is known as one of the worst mass murderers of the 20th century.After Stalin died, Eisenhower even offered praise of Stalin and reached out to the Russian people in his  Chance for Peace  speech.The world knows that an era ended with the death of Joseph Stalin. The extraordinary 30-year span of his rule saw the Soviet Empire expand to reach from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of Japan, finally to dominate 800 million souls.The Soviet system shaped by Stalin and his predecessors was born of one World War. It survived with stubborn and often amazing courage a second World War. It has lived to threaten a third.Now a new leadership has assumed power in the Soviet Union. Its links to the past, however strong, cannot bind it completely. Its future is, in great part, its own to make.The United States was even represented at Stalin s funeral by U.S. Ambassador Jacob Beam.And when Mao Tse-tung died in September 1976, President Gerald Ford sent the following condolences: Mrs. Ford joins me in extending to you our deepest sympathy on the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Chairman Mao had a profound impact on his era. . . . Please accept my personal condolences. So by attacking President Obama, Republicans are being total hypocrites. Yes, Fidel Castro was a terrible person. But he was still a human being and many people are mourning him in Cuba. Sending condolences is the human thing to do and it s the American way even if the foreign leader who died was our enemy. By extending our hand in friendship, we are sending a message to the Cuban people letting them know that we are with them and that we still want to work with them to make a better world for both of our nations.

The list is searchable by school or name and includes pictures of the university teachers and descriptions of their alleged transgressions, backed up by links to conservative news sites. Almost all the instances on the website are people who not only oppose what we believe in but are very biased against it and don t present the other side,  says Matt Lamb, director of constitutional enforcement and transparency at Turning Point. We just want students, parents, alumni to know what s going on. So if an alumni is thinking of donating to a school they may want to know where their money is going, if they believe or agree or disagree with the professor s views. So far, it looks like students and professors are fighting back. Names like Jesus and Indiana Jones have been added, with appropriate descriptions of their liberal propaganda and agenda, and the hashtag #trollprofwatchlist trended a few days ago with people posting their troll submissions to the website. The more that are added, the more confusing and difficult the job of identifying disagreeing professors will be for the fascists.However, while silliness and trolling may temporarily undermine the usefulness of the site, the underlying danger presented cannot be ignored or denied. This is an age where Republicans have their own media, their own version of the world, and in many ways, their own truth (objectivity be damned!). This is an age where  fake news  lists are passed around based on a partisan slant (those of us on the left generally understand when something is fact or opinion   the other side, not so much). This is an age where lists of professors that have ideological disagreements with the authoritarian right wing get their names published online.With Trump s rhetoric, this becomes especially problematic. There is the potential that such a list could be used not only to deny alumni donations from a school, but actually used by the more rabid of Fuhrer Trump s followers to target these men and women. Conservatives believe this is a culture war, and they ll do anything to win.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Because running it part-time just simply won t do.But Kellyanne Conway, Trump s former campaign manager who must have problems looking at herself in the mirror every morning knowing that she sold her fucking soul to help install a dictator into the highest office in the land, complained on Meet The Press on Sunday morning that doing so would rob Trump s kids of controlling the business.Of course, that s bullshit. We all know that Trump s kids get their marching orders from their daddy. And the fact that Ivanka Trump has been sitting in on meetings with foreign leaders makes it clear that the conflict of interest will continue to exist even if Trump hands the company over to them.Conway argued that Trump has already put the country first by running for president and winning. And then she started to attack the media for not treating Donald Trump like a cool guy we can all trust. You know, Chuck, he has put the country ahead of everything else just by running and, indeed, winning and becoming president of the United States. I went and looked back at what all the press clips and conversations on shows like this were eight years ago, it was basically just debating on how cool Barack Obama is. So, we should at least   if we re not going to do that about President-elect Trump   we should at the very least trust him to do the right thing. Except that Donald Trump is not cool. He s a creep who sexually assaults women and brags about it. He s a selfish wealthy prick who sticks it to the taxpayers any chance he gets. And, like Conway, he s a thin-skinned whiner who can t handle criticism or the truth, which is why Chuck Todd called Conway out. I understand every knee-jerk push back is going to be to blame the media,  Todd said.  It s a crutch. I get it and I m used to it. Not by me!  Conway insisted.  That s not fair! Here s the video via YouTube:Oh, but it is fair, Kellyanne. And it s about time someone in the press called you out for it. In virtually every media appearance she makes, blaming the media is, indeed, the crutch Conway uses when having to deal with tough legitimate questions from journalists.

Not only did Trump recently call Stein s filing for a recount in Wisconsin a  scam,  but he had a meltdown of epic proportions on Twitter last night, which carried over into this morning.In a massive tweetstorm, Trump attacked his former rival for the White House, Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic Party. He tweeted: The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore! Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change. Trump s obviously nervous, because there were already discrepancies in votes found in several precincts in Wisconsin   and they only showed on Trump s ballots. There s a problem when there are more votes than actual people who voted.Trump continued and tried to portray Clinton as a hypocrite for getting behind Stein s recount, using her own words against her. Quoting Clinton s response to Trump s own accusations that the election was  rigged  against him and his refusal to concede if he lost, Trump wrote: That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We ve had free and fair elections. We ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a   during a general election.

Trump also pointed out that Clinton called Trump s refusal to accept the election s results  a direct threat to our democracy.  It should be noted that Clinton gracefully accepted the results, and promised to regardless of the outcome   unlike Trump. In a last attempt to make Clinton look bad, Trump used a quote from her concession speech. He tweeted: We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. And completely oblivious to the fact that the Republican Party has wasted more than enough money on the ridiculous scavenger hunt into Clinton s emails, Trump said: So much time and money will be spent   same result!

There s a new sheriff in town  President Donald Trump. He s going to cleanse America and make it shine again. And, he s going to start with you Muslims. Perhaps they think Trump will be happy to deputize them in whatever crusade he launches against Muslims, and, well, pretty much everyone who isn t obviously white.This group is signing these letters as,  Americans For A Better Way,  because of course that s what they think they are.This is part of the rash of hate incidents and crimes that have occurred at the hands of Trumpkins since the Nov. 8 election. In fact, the Southern Poverty Law Center says that there had been more than 700 recorded hate incidents and crimes between the election and Nov. 18. That s more than seventy such incidents per day, compared to a little more than two anti-Trump incidents per day. And it s disgusting. It s terrifying.The Counsel for American-Islamic Relations in L.A. came forward with the letters that went to two mosques there after they learned that a mosque in Northern California had likewise gotten one. Executive Director Hassam Alyoush said: [People at the mosques are] disheartened that anyone would address fellow Americans, fellow human beings, in such a hateful, dehumanizing way.You always want to trust that most people are good, that your neighbors have been good, and that has been our experience. Sadly, for a growing number of people, believing that people are generally good is going to become a relic of the past if this keeps up. While CAIR and other organizations recognize that Trump didn t create racism (and neither did Obama), he did normalize it. He made it okay. He vindicated the lunatic fringe and now they re trying to work their way into mainstream dialogue. Ayloush said the  irresponsible, hateful rhetoric  of the Trump campaign has fueled  a level of vulgarity, vile hatred and anger among many self-proclaimed Trump supporters.' We can expect more mosques to receive letters like this (or worse), even as police in California begin investigating these incidents and stepping up protection where it s needed.

Now the party must grapple with his extreme agenda, and there are actually several Republican senators who are looking to block, or at least mitigate, some of what Trump wants to do.These aren t just any Republican senators, either. Many have a lot of influence and are seen as leaders, whether they re officially part of the leadership or not. They include Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Jeff Flake and John McCain (Arizona), Rand Paul (Kentucky), Lamar Alexander (Tennessee), Ben Sasse (Nebraska) and Lindsey Graham (South Carolina).And all of them have different agenda items against which they ll work.One of the worst potential thorns in Trump s side could be Rand Paul. In 2013, he was part of the infuriating group that shut down the government for 16 days over the Affordable Care Act, but later said it was a  dumb idea.  He s been a terrible obstructionist, but he is willing and ready to use his obstructionism to filibuster Trump s cabinet picks.Yes, he will turn against his own to prevent some of Trump s cabinet nominations from getting confirmed if he has to. He spoke out against both John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani for Secretary of State, going so far as to call Bolton  a menace.  Bolton doesn t seem to be in the running anymore, but Giuliani is. There s a possibility that Paul might oppose other potential picks as well, depending on who they are and how Paul sees them.It would only take three Republicans to block Trump s nominees on the floor, assuming Democrats unite against any controversial picks.Susan Collins of Maine is more centrist than many of her Republican colleagues, and she s very good at building bipartisan coalitions, along with others in this group. If need be, they can gain control over an issue and take some of the wind out of the leadership s sails.Ben Sasse of Nebraska is prepared to challenge Trump on executive overreach. Trump has said, in plain language, that he plans to use executive orders to accomplish some of his agenda on his very first day in office. He also used words like  reign,  during his campaign, which Sasse took major issue with. Depending on what all those items are, Trump could feel pushback from Sasse and other conservatives looking to rein in the executive branch.John McCain carries a deep distrust of Trump s buddy Putin. He, Lindsey Graham and even Ben Sasse don t believe it s a smart idea for us to try and work more closely with Russia, especially if it comes at the expense of our European allies. That could mean opposing any effort to withdraw from NATO and opposing joining forces with Russia and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.We ve tried to  reset  relations with Russia before, and Putin decided to play conqueror and invade Ukraine. McCain rightfully believes Putin is not to be trusted. Considering his and Trump s bromance, Trump may not be trustworthy in this arena either, making McCain and Graham into major problems for him.Lamar Alexander has been urging his colleagues to proceed cautiously with trying to repeal the ACA because developing a replacement could take years. Simply pulling it out  root and branch  as quickly as possible could be disastrous for the U.S., particularly if it creates a vacuum while they re hashing out every idea imaginable for replacing it. It would especially hurt the working class, many of whom have been able to get healthcare thanks to expanded Medicaid coverage and who Trump claimed to represent.Alexander also has close relationships with Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer (the new minority leader), and Patty Murray. Patty Murray is the senior Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which Alexander chairs. He can be a voice of reason sometimes, if for no other reason than he really doesn t like feeling like he must vote along party lines.It s true that some of these issues will put these senators at odds with each other. However, the Senate is split 51-48 right now, which could go to 51-49 depending on what happens in Louisiana next month. The narrow margin means it doesn t take many to create a pseudo-majority of Democrats in this environment.And while, yes, every one of these senators has been problematic for progress over the years, any Republican opposition to Trump could be extremely helpful.Every one of these senators has said that they ll take things issue by issue, rather than oppose Trump unilaterally. It s also hard to say just how committed to their issues they are vs. how committed to toeing the party line they are. If they actually remain true to their consciences, they ll be the senators we need to keep checks on the more extreme House, and on Trump s own insanity.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Shortly after Conway criticized the recount effort, Trump chimed in with a statement of his own.

Trump said: The people have spoken and the election is over, and as Hillary Clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me,  We must accept this result and then look to the future. It is important to point out that with the help of millions of voters across the country, we won 306 electoral votes on Election Day   the most of any Republican since 1988   and we carried nine of 13 battleground states, 30 of 50 states, and more than 2,600 counties nationwide   the most since President Ronald Reagan in 1984. This recount is just a way for Jill Stein, who received less than one percent of the vote overall and wasn t even on the ballot in many states, to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount. All three states were won by large numbers of voters, especially Pennsylvania, which was won by more than 70,000 votes. This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing. Trump is right that Clinton conceded the election, but she s not legally bound to that   and it s especially insane that Trump would use her concession as part of his argument because he once said he wouldn t concede. Another glaring mistake in Trump s argument is his  the people have spoken  statement, which is hilarious considering Clinton won the popular vote by a landslide, as The Atlantic s David Frum pointed out:TwitterIn Wisconsin, there have already been four precincts that were reported to have discrepancies.

His carefully crafted words are just one more example of the quiet dignity we have come to expect from this man and his family. Here is what the president had to say on Castro s passing:At this time of Fidel Castro s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans   in Cuba and in the United States   with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him.For nearly six decades, the relationship between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements. During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends   bonds of family, culture, commerce, and common humanity. This engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans, who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in Cuba.Today, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people.

Fidel Castro s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.Trump s statement, when compared to President Obama s response really does say it all, doesn t it?

Now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take the same approach in those states as well. We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states Michigan well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself. Echoing Stein s own words about making sure that America s elections maintain integrity, Elias said: We believe we have an obligation to the more than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported. Elias  entire statement can be read here. On Friday afternoon, Stein had filed for a recount in Wisconsin, promising to also follow through in Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Trump is leading by narrow margins. The deadline Stein must file for recounts in those states is Monday and Wednesday.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I assume they consist primarily of illegals, who come to Texas for  free stuff.  And of course, our unemployed Africans, who find work too much trouble, especially when they can collect the equivalent of $40,000 a year on welfare, and other  benefits  offered to the unfit, the lazy, and the under-educated and of course, the drug addicts.I expect that most who need food are marching around whining that the congenital liar, Hillary Rodham Clinton, lost the election. Too bad; How sad.I also wonder if your organization is not one of those Phoney-Baloney, so-called  charities,  designed primarily to provide a good living to its organizers.In sort, no way.Signed,Citizen RobespierreNaturally, the food bank was mortified. The lack of empathy was disturbing,  says Paul Gaither, marketing and communications director for the Food Bank.  Most of the letters we receive say things like  we don t have anything to contribute  or  please take me off your list,  but this one was a little different. It s important that we don t categorize the people we serve as  takers  Gaither said.  Most of the people we serve have fallen on hard times or are the working poor who just can t make ends meet, and that can happen to anyone. Source: GivingCityAustinBefore I tackle how this proves we need food stamps, let s talk about the misconceptions in the surprisingly literate letter. First off, food should never be treated as a luxury. You can absolutely not call yourself pro-life while at the same time advocating that people should starve. Of the 37 million people who are fed every year by food banks, 14 million of them are children and 3 million are seniors.As for undocumented immigrants, well, they aren t crossing the border to eat at food banks. They are crossing the border, for the most part, to work and that s what they do. Collectively, undocumented immigrants contribute almost $12 billion each year to our country because they pay taxes and get nothing in return. We should be thanking them instead of sending hateful notes about them.It s not just unemployed people who need food banks, so do people who work minimum wage jobs. Texas happens to be among the states with the very lowest wages. Only Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi have lower wages. In other words, in states like Texas, laziness has nothing to do with the ability to put food on the table.Now, back to the food stamps argument. One Republican argument has always been that if the government stops offering a social safety net, private charities will pick up the slack. While that sounds like a beautiful idea (sort of), it s simply not true. People s ability to eat should not depend on the whims of people, nor should it depend on the economy or whether a charity can effectively market itself. We tried that in the past. It didn t work.Instead, that time in history proved that privately funded charities can be both bigoted and very selective in who they cover. If you can imagine the writer of this letter, for example, giving to any charity, do you honestly think (s)he d give to a charity that serviced minority areas? No. That s where government comes in. Making sure Americans have enough food is our moral prerogative. Relying on bigots like Citizen Robespierre should be out of the question, no matter who is hungry.As for the Central Texas Food Bank, well, they are a damn good charity. They score 100 out of 100 on Charity Navigator. The vast majority of the people they serve are not homeless. 1/3 of the recipients are white.Featured image via State Farm/Flickr.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Jill Stein s push for recounts in some battleground states is gaining momentum. Stein raised $5 million to cover the costs of recounts over the Thanksgiving holiday, and as soon as the Green Party pays its fee, the Wisconsin Elections Board is prepared to go forward with a statewide recount.The elections board has already put an internal team together, they ve been working with their county clerks, and they ve arranged for the necessary legal counsel from the Wisconsin Department of Justice. Michael Haas, the election board s administrator, said: We plan to hold a teleconference meeting for county clerks next week and anticipate the recount will begin late in the week after the Stein campaign has paid the recount fee, which we are still calculating. This is unlike the Florida recounts in 2000, where the vote was so close it automatically triggered a machine recount. From there, well, we all remember how it spiraled out of control. Al Gore won the popular vote that year, but not nearly to the degree that Hillary has won this year s popular vote.Also, Wisconsin does not have an automatic recount trigger   a candidate has to request a recount no matter how close the vote is.A battleground state recount isn t going to help Jill Stein any, and she knows that, so what s her game here? She says she s worried that foreign hackers skewed our votes and elected Trump for us. The Green Party is actually asking Wisconsin for a reconciliation of paper records, which goes a step beyond a simple vote recount   it s an audit of paper ballots and paper trails from electronic voting machines. They re focusing on the substantial increase of absentee ballots in Wisconsin, along with the electronic voting systems that have been under scrutiny since we began seeing massive cyberattacks from parties interested in influencing our election results.Stein s fundraising website makes it clear that they know there s no guarantee any states in which the Greens are petitioning will actually move on to a recount, and she does admit that they don t have a smoking gun that proves Trump s win is illegitimate.In fact, Wisconsin actually doesn t believe a recount will change anything, despite the fact that some major vote discrepancies have already been found. Howver, provided all paperwork is filed properly, they will generally proceed with their recounts regardless.Hillary is now leading the national popular vote by 2.1 million, and is approaching a 2 percent margin. That s a greater margin than John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Grover Cleveland, James A. Garfield, and James K. Polk had when they were elected. If her lead continues to grow, she could approach Jimmy Carter s margin, and perhaps George W. Bush s margin of victory in 2004.Hillary and her campaign have stayed quietly out of the recount debate thus far. Stein and the Green Party are pushing for recounts in both Michigan and Pennsylvania as well, but it s not yet known whether those two states will actually do it. It s also not clear whether this could flip the election. What Wisconsin does in the coming days could set an interesting tone.Photo of Donald Trump by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images.

Medicare itself would whither of the vine and die and anyone who is on Medicare or looked forward to it would be shit out of luck because they would get less care at higher prices.On Tuesday, Kellyanne Conway even signaled that Trump will consider Ryan s proposal to gut Medicare. He will, I m sure, take a look at Speaker Ryan s proposal and other proposals,  Conway said.  In this case, he will go ahead and look at alternatives. Well, if Republicans thought they would be able to just jam through whatever laws they want, they are gravely mistaken.Incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer fired a warning shot at the GOP on Friday making it clear that Democrats will fight tooth and nail to block any Republican bill that dismantles the popular healthcare program that has been working perfectly since 1966 when it was enacted. The Republicans  ideological and visceral hatred of government could deny millions of senior citizens across the country the care they need and deserve,  Schumer said.  To our Republican colleagues considering this path, Democrats say,  Make our day.  Your effort will fail, and this attack on our seniors will not stand. Nancy Pelosi chimed in with a warning of her own. It s ideological with the speaker to take away the guarantee of Medicare,  she said.  But [the program] is a fundamental pillar of health and economic security. And we will not go down that path. In short, Democrats in the House and Senate are prepared to to obstruct Republicans in the same way they obstructed President Obama over the last eight years. And that s exactly what Democrats need to do. They need to more vicious and uncooperative than Republicans ever were. It s time to give them a taste of their own medicine for America s sake. Anything less should be punished harshly when the midterm elections roll around in 2018. So Democrats better hold the line and fiercely defend America s social contract or they can expect primary challenges. There is absolutely no excuse for Democrats to treat Trump better than Republicans treated President Obama. In fact, there is every reason to treat him worse.

And the only thing that can stop him is the Electoral College.That s why Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig is openly calling upon the Electoral College to save us from this abomination that has made a mockery of our Constitution without even setting one foot inside the White House yet.Most Americans would agree that the Electoral College is an outdated part of our election that should be removed. But in this instance, it the last hope America has to keep Trump and his racist minions from destroying our country.In an op-ed for the Washington Post, Lessig points out that the Founding Fathers adopted the Electoral College as an additional check on our elections to make sure that demagogues and con artists like Donald Trump don t get to be president.Hillary Clinton currently has more than a 2 million vote lead over Trump in the popular vote, which means the will of the American people has been trampled by an electoral system that Republicans may very well have rigged this year, which is why Jill Stein has raised enough money to trigger a recount in three battleground states.On December 19th, the electors will meet to cast their votes for president and vice-president. And when they do, they have a chance to put the rightful winner of the 2016 Election in the White House.According to Lessig, the Electoral College  is not meant to deny a reasonable judgment by the people. It is meant to be a circuit breaker   just in case the people go crazy. In this election, the people did not go crazy. The winner, by far, of the popular vote is the most qualified candidate for president in more than a generation. Like her or not, no elector could have a good-faith reason to vote against her because of her qualifications. Choosing her is thus plainly within the bounds of a reasonable judgment by the people. The framers left the electors free to choose. They should exercise that choice by leaving the election as the people decided it: in Clinton s favor.In short, electors need to do the right and moral thing and vote for Hillary Clinton, even if it means being fined for voting their conscience.Over 4 million Americans have already signed a petition asking the Electoral College to vote for Clinton. Fell free to sign it by clicking here.These electors have a responsibility to keep our country from burning down to the ground. Trump has already proven that he isn t taking the presidency seriously and that he intends put our government into the hands of people who want to destroy it.Lessig is right to ask the electors to switch their votes to Clinton and the rest of us need to ask them to do it, too. We need to support them and tell them we have their back. Sure, conservatives will bitch about it. But at this point, who really gives a shit about them anyway?

Medicare is a single-payer system that Americans pay into every time they get a paycheck. And when they turn 65 they can enroll and get a large part of their healthcare coverage taken care of by the federal government. Over 55 million Americans currently rely on Medicare. The program is fiscally solvent through 2028 and a simple way to make it infinitely solvent would be to apply the payroll tax to all income over $100,000.But none of those facts matter to Trump and the Republicans in Congress.You see, they want to privatize the program, which is code for giving it to Wall Street. And as we all know, Wall Street isn t exactly the best place to keep our money. If President Bush had privatized Social Security, something Republicans also want to do while Trump is in charge, the recession would have wiped out the funds and millions of senior citizens would have been left in dire straits.But Trump minion Kellyanne Conway told PBS on Tuesday that Trump is willing to consider Ryan s plan to dismantle Medicare. President-elect Trump has made very clear that he wants to make good on the promises that we as a nation have made to the seniors who rely upon Medicare, and certainly the lower income Americans who rely upon Medicaid and other entitlements like Social Security, frankly, for those who receive that,  she claimed.Ryan s plan however would raise the the retirement age of Medicare and turn it into a voucher system that won t be guaranteed like the system that we have now. He will, I m sure, take a look at Speaker Ryan s proposal and other proposals,  Conway continued.  In this case, he will go ahead and look at alternatives as long as it does not interfere with what he has said, his commitment to keep the promises to those currently relying on them. Here s the video via PBS. The Medicare remarks are at the 5:20 mark.Trump is already backing away from just about every campaign promise he has made and Medicare is no different.According to Talking Points Memo,During the campaign Trump had vowed that he was  not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.  Now, his transition website states that he will  modernize  Medicare,  so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation   and beyond  and  [m]aximize flexibility for States [sic] in administering Medicaid. In other words, gutting Medicare and handing what s left to Wall Street is on the table, and if Republicans have their way the program will be dead within the next four years.That means every senior citizen who relies on Medicare for their healthcare needs should start preparing for the higher costs, less care, and less government oversight that comes with handing large government programs that work to vultures. And while seniors may get a half-assed version of Medicare, anyone else who hasn t reached retirement will get nothing but a voucher that isn t worth shit.Frankly, if you are a senior citizen or a worker who has paid into Medicare in hopes that it will be there for you when you need it, you re out of luck. And if you voted for Donald Trump and the GOP, you deserve the reaming you are about to receive.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Even Trump says he likes the popular vote better   he just also claims he d have won if that s what was counted, which is clearly not the case. From Politico:Trump himself is a noted critic of the Electoral College who called it  a disaster for a democracy  in 2012, and he told New York Times reporters Tuesday he would  rather do the popular vote  and was  never a fan of the Electoral College until now. The popular vote would have been a lot easier,  Trump said,  but it s a whole different campaign. I would have been in California, I would have been in Texas, Florida and New York, and we wouldn t have gone anywhere else. Which is, I mean I d rather do the popular vote. But I think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because you d go to a few places,  he added.  I think that s the genius of the Electoral College. I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now. In fact, if her lead keeps growing, there s a possibility she could win the popular vote by more than George Bush did in 2004 (when he won re-election).

And without that, they re finished.The difference between Barack Obama and Donald Trump can be summed up like this: When Obama ran for his first term, he was elected with the most votes ever won by a presidential candidate, ever   almost 70 million. Trump? He is setting a record, too   for the biggest popular vote loss in history while winning the election. Other presidents have lost the popular vote while winning the election, but Donald Trump is unique in that he lost by more than all of them combined, times two.Great job, Donald Trump! You singlehandedly made reforming the electoral college a major political issue. And if the National Popular Vote Bill is passed in a few more states, the nation won t see another Republican president until they broaden their appeal.Here s a video from Rachel Maddow breaking down exactly how crazy these election results really are:Featured image via video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Morning Joe is on MSNBC, which is supposedly the left-wing political news and opinion network. Its host, Joe Scarborough styles himself as a moderate conservative willing to criticize the nutjob faction of his own party, and in many instances he is. He dresses this up by having left-leaning co-hosts like Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist, along with frequent guests who are also Democrats, like former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. However, Scarborough never lets us forget that he is still a Republican, and still holds, at least on some level, some of the GOP s most despicable and bigoted views. This was definitely on display Wednesday morning, when the talk turned to President Obama s legacy and his overall presidency in comparison to supposedly improving approval numbers for our newly elected orange buffoon, Donald Trump. That s when Scarborough made this shockingly racist statement: Obama came in as black Jesus. I don t want to come in as redneck Jesus if I m a president of the United States. You want to come in where people   like Ronald Reagan   actually underestimate you. And the media, once again, has done Donald Trump a great favor. What have they told us over the past week? He s a white supremacist, he s a Nazi, he s bringing Nazis back to America. Scarborough ended his tirade by calling his colleagues in the press  fools  in their attempts to derail and bludgeon Trump  in the wrong way. They set the bar so low, Donald Trump says there s a bar, I m going to walk over it. For one thing, Joe Scarborough, that is about as racist as it gets. Of course there were high expectations for President Obama. He is the first African American man to be elected not once, but twice, and in record numbers. No matter what one thinks of the man himself or of his policy prescriptions, that fact alone makes his presidency an historic one, and puts an amazing amount of pressure upon him.Secondly, his presidency is far from a failure. Despite the fact that GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and the rest of the obstructionists in your party had one goal and one goal only in mind   to make sure Obama failed and lasted just one term   he still got plenty done. He cleaned up the economic mess George W. Bush left the nation and world in, got record numbers of Americans health insurance, made the military a safer place for LGBTQ people, got rid of the bigoted Defense of Marriage Act, and secured marriage equality for all. This and so much more happened on President Obama s watch, with your party of obstructionists blocking him all the way.As for Donald Trump? No one called Trump himself a Nazi. However, there is no denying that he has spent his entire ugly, repugnant campaign playing footsie with neo-Nazis, Klan members, and other assorted racist bigots. Hell, he s done such a good job of that he actually has the gall to put a literal white supremacist steps from the Oval Office, and nominate a man who was deemed to racist to be a federal judge to run the entire Justice Department. No, there s no denying which direction Trump swings when it comes to race.So, in other words, check your racism, Joe Scarborough. You re dead wrong on this one. You re just one more piece of proof that even so-called  reasonable  Republicans are still as racist as they come.Watch the full exchange here:Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The most dangerous aspect of the fact that he has no government or military experience isn t necessarily the lack of experience itself, but rather his refusal to listen to the people who do have that experience and allow them to guide the ship of state in this dangerous and complicated world until he can be adequately brought up to speed. Case in point   his refusal to receive daily national intelligence briefings since his victory.According to The Hill, Trump has been given the green light by the Obama Administration to receive daily intelligence briefings prior to taking office   the same ones that President Obama himself gets. Instead, Trump has received just two of those briefings since he clinched the electoral victory and thus the presidency, because he is refusing to listen to intelligence officials.These briefings include the rapidly changing scope of national security threats on the world stage, something Trump is definitely woefully ignorant of. However, being the egotistical scumbag that he is, Trump of course seems to believe himself to be above such petty concerns. I never thought I d be saying this, but it seems that Trump s vice presidential-elect, Mike Pence, is showing himself to be the reasonable one here, and has taken to receiving the briefings himself, since Trump won t. You know we re in deep shit when the likes of the climate and evolution denying, anti-woman, anti-LGBTQ religious nut that is Mike Pence can be described as the reasonable voice in the room, but here we are.Of course, the sycophants who regularly make the rounds on all of the political talks shows to excuse away Trump s dangerous nonsense are pushing back on the idea that he is out of his element and needs all the help he can get in this area before taking the oath of office. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) insisted in an interview with the Washington Post, which first broke this alarming development, that the security of America and her people is Trump s  No. 1 priority,  going on to say that he thinks Trump is taking it very seriously.  Ever more defensive, Nunes continued: Look how many leaders he s met with, how many phone calls he s done, positions he s filled. People who are being critical need to get a life. No, we, the citizens of this great country have every right to push back on bizarre and dangerous irregularities like this, Rep. Nunes. Here we have a man who knows nothing about the world attempting to lead it on the most potentially lethal ego trip the world has ever seen and who refuses to take the advice of those who have the potential to save us all. A top security official has already said that Trump, quote,  has a lot of catching up to do,  in this arena, and yet he is refusing to get the help he needs.Actions speak louder than words, and Trump s actions say that he is more interested in parading candidates for his cabinet for the cameras in some kind of dangerous and bizarre real world reality show, using his new position to wheel and deal in his own business interests, and flying around the country in his jet rather than actually, you know, trying to learn how to run the nation and lead the free world.Be very afraid, America.

At least that s how pro-rich, trickle-down obsessed Republicans see it. And now they have reason to cheer   a federal judge in Texas has blocked that rule. It would have extended overtime pay to millions of American workers.There s a problem, though. A glaring one that Igor Volsky pointed out on Twitter. The very people that the GOP claims to represent, particularly now that Trump is president, are the ones who will be hurt the worst by blocking this rule. It raised the mandatory overtime threshold from $23,660 to $47,500.They ve also forgotten that they re far wealthier than the millions of people who would have benefited from this rule.

They either wrongly classify many employees as exempt when they shouldn t be under the law, or they change job titles to things like  manager  to justify making them exempt. Then they continue to pay a pittance and treat them like hourly employees. All of this is illegal.It s easy for Republicans to say that blocking the overtime rule will help these hardworking Americans keep their jobs. They never think about the fact that people don t have jobs because they think it ll be fun or because they re bored. People have jobs because they have to work to live.And it s time Republicans stop pretending that it s perfectly okay for workers to be unable to make ends meet despite working insane hours or multiple jobs, because hey, at least they have a job.Champions of the working class? Hardly. It s more important to continue letting business run amok and claim that they re reining in Obama s supposedly extreme use of executive power. This is same ol , same ol  from the GOP.

Amazon pulled a ton of one-star reviews that all came from a pro-Trump Reddit. While USAToday reported early this morning that 17 percent of the reviews on Kelly s book were one-stars   at one point, 76 percent of those reviews were one star ratings. There were more than 400 reviews total that came in over the weekend, which means that a lot of people were trying to kill the book s sales because they love Trump and despise anyone who makes him look even slightly less than godlike.These reviews consisted of things like: This woman is not a journalist   She is an attention seeker   She is also paid by the DNC to report fake stories that have no truth to them whatsoever. Megyn Kelly is getting paid by the DNC to report fake news? Not hardly, but unfortunately, Amazon does not require anyone to source their accusations when they leave a bad review.Another said: Wow get over yourself. Your [sic] not that good!

While the publisher, Harper-Collins, did contact Amazon over the fact that these reviews had all the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit Megyn Kelly, her own attorneys may or may not have contacted Amazon as well.

We re going to tax Wall Street. These days, he s singing a different tune. Instead of taxing them, he s cutting taxes on the rich. Instead of  stopping them from getting away with murder,  they re getting rid of the financial regulations that will stop another recession. And instead of standing up for consumers, he s destroying the agency that has recouped over $10 billion from predatory financial companies.After electorally winning the election (while massively losing the popular vote   1.7 million at the time of this writing and growing), he is openly showing what many of us knew along: He doesn t give a single sh*t about any of his supporters, and he will stab them in the back repeatedly and at length until somebody stops him.Donald Trump never had any intention of raising taxes on  hedge fund guys.  After all, they re in the same class of people he is! Rich, and therefore better than you. Why should they have to pay taxes? Trump doesn t, and thinks it s smart.Trump s administration wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is the Wall Street reform and consumer protection package passed after the Great Recession to prevent the need for another bailout at taxpayer expense. Trump thinks, instead, that the banks will do better regulating themselves   much the way they did in the years leading up to the 2007-08 crash. Here s what Trump and the GOP are against:An Act to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end  too big to fail,  to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.And it gets worse.As ThinkProgress reports,Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency focused on protecting Americans from predatory and fraudulent bank behavior. It s already recouped more than $10 billion for those who have been targeted by such practices. The CFPB has also written new rules for mortgage lending while extending oversight to some financial firms, such as debt collectors and payday lenders, that had previously gone with little oversight.That s right   Donald Trump wants to get rid of one of the few parts of government that consistently works on behalf of the little guy. They re also targeting seniors:Trump made a campaign promise to impose a moratorium on all new regulations for the financial sector, but he has already targeted existing regulations for immediate dismantling. Trump adviser and hedge fund investor Anthony Scaramucci promised to reverse President Obama s executive action to protect retirees the fiduciary duty rule. It requires all financial advisers to put their clients  interests ahead of their own, rather than being able to steer clients toward more expensive options that make money for themselves. That conflicted advice is estimated to cost retirees $17 billion a year. We ve got to get rid of this,  Scaramucci told the Financial Times, calling it  unnecessary.  He had previously made this pledge while likening the rule to the 1857 Dred Scott Supreme Court decision that denied birthright citizenship to slaves and their descendants.He s giving the banks exactly what they want.In fact, he seems to think that he might need them a little closer to him so that he can really serve them well, because he s actually inviting bank executives to work in his administration   certainly a far cry from his pro-working class messages on the campaign trail. According to Politico, his leading picks for Secretary of the Treasury are a Goldman-Sachs executive and a billionaire investor.The working class Republicans that voted for Trump are some of the people who will be most hurt by the actual policies that the Trump administration wants to put into effect.

Well, that s going to be just a teensy bit harder now after the publication was banned by an ad vendor for hate speech. Breitbart is just a publication,  Trump said in a recent interview with the New York Times.  They are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than the New York Times.

It s a pretty big thing. There s no question that Breitbart is a  big thing,  but that s not exactly a good thing when it s something that Bannon himself described Breitbart as the  platform for the alt-right,  a term used to describe white supremacists who took a day off of abusing methamphetamines to throw on a suit and complain about the plight of white people in a seemingly legitimate setting. Nevertheless, Trump says he would never have hired Bannon had he any indicator (like an admission from Bannon that he runs a large platform for white supremacists) that he was alt-right: I ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right   I wouldn t even think about hiring him. The Donald says that he intends to get to the bottom of what is energizing the extreme Right (him) and find out why (because he appeals to racists).Trump s decision to appoint a white nationalist to a high-level position spurred AppNexus, a major advertising technology provider, to look into what sort of operation Bannon had birthed   and they didn t like what they found:AppNexus Inc., a major advertising technology provider, has barred Breitbart News from using its ad-serving tools because the conservative online publisher violated its hate speech rules.AppNexus scrutinized Breitbart s website after U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump tapped Steve Bannon, former executive chairman of Breitbart, to be White House chief strategist last week. The digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence, said AppNexus spokesman Joshua Zeitz. We did a human audit of Breitbart and determined there were enough articles and headlines that cross that line, using either coded or overt language,  he said.Bloomberg notes that while Breitbart does not buy ads from AppNexus directly, the ban means that they will not receive ads from the ad server the company runs and this will likely lower the price of ads on the site   which means less money for the modern day Neo-Nazis.Will more advertising companies follow suit?

The academics presented findings showing that in Wisconsin, Clinton received 7 percent fewer votes in counties that relied on electronic-voting machines compared with counties that used optical scanners and paper ballots. Based on this statistical analysis, Clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes; she lost Wisconsin by 27,000. While it s important to note the group has not found proof of hacking or manipulation, they are arguing to the campaign that the suspicious pattern merits an independent review   especially in light of the fact that the Obama White House has accused the Russian government of hacking the Democratic National Committee.Source: NY MagazineThose three states were the determining factor in this year s election. In total, Trump won Pennsylvania by about 68,000 votes, Wisconsin by 27,000 votes and Michigan by just 11,000 votes. Clinton won the popular vote. According to their research, Clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes in Wisconsin, which is enough to swing it to her.According to current tallies, Trump has won 290 Electoral College votes to Clinton s 232, with Michigan s 16 votes not apportioned because the race there is still too close to call. It would take overturning the results in both Wisconsin (10 Electoral College votes) and Pennsylvania (20 votes), in addition to winning Michigan s 16, for Clinton to win the Electoral College. There is also the complicating factor of  faithless electors,  or members of the Electoral College who do not vote according to the popular vote in their states. At least six electoral voters have said they would not vote for Trump, despite the fact that he won their states.This is far from a sure thing. Nate Silver doesn t see problems:Run a regression on Wisc. counties with >=50K people, and you find that Clinton improved more in counties with only paper ballots.

Trump Foundation to multiple instances in which the organization appears to have violated the legal prohibition against using charitable funds to benefit its leaders, their family members, or other disqualified individuals   commonly known as  self-dealing. According to press reports, the Foundation spent more than a quarter-million dollars of charitable funds to settle various lawsuits involving the President-elect s for-profit companies.The Foundation also reportedly used $20,000 of charitable funds to purchase a six-foot tall portrait of the President-elect, and at the time the Foundation was predominately funded by other donors.The Foundation also previously paid a 10% excise tax to the IRS for reportedly providing an illegal $25,000 political contribution to the campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Ryan s Ayn Randish vision for America has been well documented with his plans to slash the safety net while giving a big middle finger to the middle and lower-income classes.Yes, this is a war. One in which Americans will suffer greatly. Millions of low-income Americans on Medicaid could lose their health coverage if Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress follow through with their plans.Vox reports that Trump has: already endorsed Ryan s plans on Medicaid and has attacked food stamps at length. His vice president, Mike Pence, is a longtime friend and congressional ally of Ryan s who if anything has argued for larger cuts than the ones Ryan wants.We can expect an increase in poverty. I ve been working on these issues since 1972,  Robert Greenstein, the founder and president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Washington s leading advocate for poor and low-income Americans, said, according to Vox.  This is by far the gravest threat to the safety net, and to low-income people, that I ve seen in my close to half a century of working on these issues. I think there s a potential in the first seven months, by the August recess, for Congress to pass policies that do more to increase poverty and hardship and widen inequality than we ve seen in half a century. If Obamacare is repealed without a viable replacement, 22 million people will be denied coverage.Paul Ryan, like his conservative colleagues, seeks fewer regulations for insurance companies. Insurance companies would offer worse policies and the quality of care would go down.Trump s replacement plan is even worse than Ryan s.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates it d spare just 1 million people who d otherwise lose insurance through Obamacare repeal. Full repeal without replacement takes insurance away from 22 million; Trump s plan takes it away from 21 million. The difference is minimal.And yet, here s the thing. Trump has already broken numerous campaign promises and he s not even in office yet. He has suggested that he won t fully repeal Obamacare but now, he s beholden to Republicans who control the Senate and the House. Even if he says no, the wheels are in motion. He s the one who started turning them.Because eating while poor is bad:CBPP estimates that the most recent House budget gets 62 percent of its cuts from programs for low- and moderate-income people. That includes at least $150 billion in cuts to food stamps and nearly $500 billion in mostly unspecified cuts to other low-income programs like SSI (which provides cash to the disabled and elderly), Pell Grants, and what little remains of welfare.Republicans have been trying to eradicate President Obama s signature healthcare legislation so it was watered down. Tea Party Republicans went to town halls where Democrats attempted to answer questions from constituents. The noise from Republicans was deafening and hardly a word could be heard about the bill. So, it got watered down because conservatives told us that socialism is bad. They told us this after driving to the town hall meetings on taxpayer funded public roads.As it happens, medical professionals do not want Obamacare repealed.

Let s take a look at his ideologies. In October, Jamison wrote a blog post explaining that he sees no reason for the FCC to exist. Most of the original motivations for having an FCC have gone away,  Jamison wrote.  Telecommunications network providers and ISPs are rarely, if ever, monopolies. As reported by the Washington Post:Jamison has argued that the FCC could be replaced by a much smaller agency charged with handing out licenses for wireless airwaves   essentially acting as a traffic cop for the spectrum over which cellphone calls, mobile data and TV signals travel.Many of the FCC s existing functions could be farmed out, Jamison wrote in the blog post. Subsidies for phone and Internet service could be handled by state governments, while the Federal Trade Commission could handle consumer complaints and take action against abuses by companies. There are some details that were not addressed in the blog post due to time constraints, Jamison said Tuesday, such as the possible need for new state-level powers to address broadband monopolies.FCC leadership has made it clear that they strongly disagree with Jamison s assessment. Tom Wheeler, the Democratic chairman of the FCC, has said that in much of the country there is a  duopoly  when it comes to internet service providers. This severely limits the options of many consumers.Wheeler has fought against companies who have slowed down internet speeds for users with unlimited plans. He has also taken action against companies who have billed customers for content and services they didn t sign up for. He has implemented rules regarding net neutrality to prohibit anticompetitive behavior. Wheeler also took steps to protect the public by forcing internet providers to follow the same privacy guidelines when handling consumer data as legacy phone companies.Hal Singer, an economist at the George Washington University s Institute for Public Policy, said both Jamison and Jeffrey Eisenach, the other member of Trump s two-man tech transition team,  envision a significantly pared-down agency. In their minds, proponents of regulation must demonstrate a market failure  This is a 180-degree turn from Wheeler s FCC, which began with a presumption that markets failed. Getting rid of the FCC would be disastrous, especially for the internet.

But the election of Donald trump has apparently emboldened him to violate all sense of judicial ethics and human decency to warn new citizens that they better accept Trump as their president or else.

If Donald Trump can help her heal, then perhaps that s a good thing to do,  Conway continued, adding that Clinton  still has to face the fact that a majority of Americans don t find her to be honest or trustworthy. Well, that s a lie. Votes are still being counted but as of right now, Clinton leads in the popular vote by 1.7 million.

And if the alt-right thinks that they have a friend in the White House, it s not because of Donald Trump, who s repeatedly denounced racism, it s because of liberal commentators who completely take him out of context, who gloss over the fact that he has called out racism, and mischaracterize his statements like you just did when he said he called Mexican immigrants rapists. That is not what he said. Um, yes it is, but Trump surrogates live in an alternate reality, where his words aren t actually his words   some liberal ventriloquist pretended they were Trump s words.The rest of the panel wasn t having it, though. Journalist Peter Beinart, of Haaretz, shot back at her: With all due respect, I really don t think that s why they think they have a friend. I did not imagine that Donald Trump spent years claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. I didn t make that up. I didn t make up the fact that Donald Trump responded to the San Bernardino attack by calling for a halt to Muslim immigration into the United States.You are the one who, at every turn, has tried to defend the indefensible about this man. Oh, burn! McEnany apparently didn t like that, because she changed tactics and tried to invoke Reagan in a horribly wrong way, given Matt Lews, of The Daily Caller, said Reagan denounced bigotry and racism.

Trump would allow corporations that have stashed their profits overseas to pay just a fraction of what the companies owe in federal taxes,  he wrote.  And then he would allow the companies to  invest  in infrastructure projects in exchange for even more tax breaks. Trump s plan is corporate welfare coming and going. Other influential voices like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman have also pointed out the attempt at graft and greed that would no doubt be present in a Trump infrastructure proposal.Democrats hoping to regain power will be tested to stand up to attempts to schmooze them from Trump and a compliant media eager to give the incoming president a  win.

The program was implemented in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, but largely suspended in 2011. All aliens from high-risk areas are tracked,  the document reads.The document then calls for  extreme vetting questions  for  high-risk aliens ; echoing Trump s campaign rhetoric. High-risk aliens would be questioned about support for Sharia law (Islamic religious law), jihad, the equality of men and women and the U.S. Constitution.The document also asks for reducing the intake of Syrian refugees to zero.In other words, Trump s current top pick for Homeland Security wants a registry, wants to violate religious freedoms through extreme vetting, is completely against actually helping anyone, and is too stupid to put the damn papers in the binder before posing for a picture.Also included in the document, but hidden partially by his arm so that context is unavailable: the Patriot Act, voter rolls, and possible amendments to the Voting Rights Act. Considering Trump s rhetoric and what the rest of the paper contains, that is terrifying. It looks as though Republicans want to use the Department of Homeland Security to suppress the Democratic vote.Kobach was the one who designed the previous registry system for immigrants as well   the one that was abandoned in 2011 because it was completely useless, and is also un-American in concept:Right off the bat, Kobach starts his list by detailing the way he will institute the Muslim registry. First, he wants to restart the highly ineffective and civil rights-violating Bush screening and tracking policy known as  NSEERS.  The program forced Muslim immigrants to register and then routinely check in with immigration officials while they were in the US or face jail or deportation. It was also a disaster. Obama scrapped the whole thing in his first term. (Source)It didn t even result in a single terrorist being prosecuted.

That means widespread deportation of anyone who isn t  white enough,  and possibly worse. Given that the administration is actually, really discussing a registry for Muslims that could lead to internment, the idea that they can influence Trump against other groups, too, isn t all that far-fetched anymore.And the rise of hate incidents and crimes against anyone who isn t white serves as further evidence that these Nazi-types feel they ve been vindicated because of Trump s election.Haaretz reporter Peter Beinart called these  interesting times  on Twitter, as he watched Spencer spew anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric while waiting to pick up his son at a Jewish school.

This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected.Some reporters in attendance were NBC s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd; ABC s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz; CBS  Norah O Donnell and Charlie Rose; Fox News  Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott; MSNBC s Phil Griffin; and CNN s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett.

Or, as one person put it,  It was like a f*cking firing squad. Trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post, one anonymous source said: The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down. This claim was backed up by another person, who said: The meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. Trump kept saying,  We re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars. This attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings.Americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is:TwitterTwitterTwitterInterestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well.

In fact, the Pope specifically wrote,  I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life. However, in perhaps the Church s first acknowledgement that women are people and not just birthing vessels, Pope Francis also said: In the same way, however, I can and must state that there is no sin that God s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father.  The letter continues:  May every priest, therefore, be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation. I henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion. This move is incremental. In 1983, Pope John Paul allowed bishops to lift excommunications to women who ve had abortions. Some bishops allowed priests to do the same, but this will be the first time that women around the world will be able to approach their priests, hoping they ll be granted forgiveness, with an actual chance of getting it.Still, conservatives want none of it:@FoxNews There has always been forgiveness it doesn t make the Sin of killing ones own Child less Atrocious They she be shunned from Society  GodBlessAmerica ??

Well, guess what, smart guy? Torture CREATES  radical Islamic terrorists. When President Obama first took office in 2008, one of the first steps he took was to inform the American public about the Republican torture program which had occurred under George Bush, and to put a stop to it:In one of his first acts as president, Obama signed an executive order that banned the use of torture by the CIA And three months later, his administration released Justice Department memos that revealed some of the arguments that Bush administration lawyers used to approve them.

So what are we going to do about it? We re going to cause massive immigration delays and blow yet another hole in the deficit by going forward with the Muslim ban. Or rather, we re potentially going to piss off some allies by suspending all immigration from certain countries: We don t believe in religious tests and   are not blanketly judging an entire religion, but, in fact, we will try to pinpoint the problems and temporarily suspend those areas from coming into the United States until a better vetting system is in place. And yet, they want to implement a  values test,  through which people can lie to their heart s content. Given the Trump train s Islamophobia, such a values test could actually look like a religious test.He s targeting both refugees and other immigrants from areas where there might be a problem with terrorism that could end up getting exported here, and will use both DHS and the Department of State to pinpoint these countries, and we ll develop our  extreme vetting  and all will be right with the world.As reported everywhere about five million times, we already have an extensive vetting system in place for refugees, whatever Trump, Priebus, and the rest of the fear-mongerers keep pushing.We likewise have a very lengthy, complex, and extensive vetting process in place for other immigrants. Most applicants need a U.S. sponsor a relative or potential employer as assurance that they aren t coming here to be a burden on our system. The whole process starts with a petition, and then goes to National Visa Center screening if the petition is approved.There are also in-depth interviews that take place, along with about a squillion forms that must be filled out and submitted to the NVC. When they finally come to the U.S., they generally have a packet about an inch thick which U.S. Customs and Border Protection evaluates before granting entry into the U.S. From there, immigrants get sent to Customs and Immigration Services for processing.Trump would add a  values test  to this already-lengthy and complex process. This is to ensure that no potential Muslim extremists could successfully immigrate here, and is actually not entirely without precedent here. However, our current law states that we will not apply values tests to potential immigrants.Other parts of the plan, including the rest of his  extreme vetting,  could actually strain State Department and DHS resources and cause major delays. How bad the whole thing will be depends heavily on what countries they plan to target, which could be limited to the Middle East, but could just as easily stretch into Europe and parts of Africa.

Trump, who claims he never settles lawsuits, did just that on Saturday when he agreed to pay $25 million in the Trump University fraud suits. While that might seem like a bit of justice served, it was revealed on Sunday that it will be the taxpayers who will pick up the bill.To be fair, it s not Trump s fault. It s the fault of the US tax code, which, as usual, favors the wealthy   you know, the people who can afford to pay $25 million in lawsuit settlements.Of course, the real cost to Mr. Trump is after tax, not before it. And most business settlements are fully tax deductible. The only part that arguably may not be here is the $1 million in penalties. But barring express non-deductibility commitments, many penalties can be deducted, too. In general, fines and penalties paid to the government are not deductible. Section 162(f) of the tax code prohibits deducting  any fine or similar penalty paid to a government for the violation of any law. Despite punitive sounding names, though, some fines and penalties are considered remedial and deductible. That allows some flexibility. Companies often deduct  compensatory penalties,  a maneuver affirmed in a recent Circuit Court ruling. Some defendants insist that their settlement agreement confirms that the payments are not penalties and are remedial. Conversely, some government entities insist on the reverse. Explicit provisions about taxes in settlement agreements are becoming more common.Source: ForbesYes, that is tax code, but there are exceptions which the Justice Department can enforce. For example, Credit Suisse was forbidden from writing off its fine of $2.6 billion for tax evasion.This all brings us back to the fact that we still don t have access to Donald Trump s tax returns. He doesn t pay taxes at all and in fact, one year, he reported a near billion dollar loss.Trump supporters paint him in a passive light. After all, it s not his fault the tax code is so easy for the wealthy to manipulate. The fact is, though, it s wealthy people like him who have been writing the tax laws for decades.

If you re going to be a police officer and serve all the public, you can t assume black people standing up for their rights are equivalent to the KKK. That s about the most horrific equivalence imaginable.Also, according to WaPo: Husk, 37, who had been with the department for about two and a half years, had also shared a meme showing President Obama with the words:  Was Dallas a terrorist attack? Yes! Carried out by Obama s own homegrown terrorist group! Which is a blatant lie and anyone who were to feel that way belongs nowhere near law enforcement. The city took the proper action letting this racist cop go, and hopefully it will be an example to police departments all over the country that this sort of behavior simply cannot be tolerated.Trump s election must not be allowed to serve as a permission slip to bigots everywhere that it s fine to be as awful as possible, because here in the land of the free and the home of the brave, everyone is protected.

Every time anything negative about him comes out in the media, he somehow, in someway, usually via Twitter, is able to pivot even the most expert journalist away from what we should actually be focusing on.Trump did this throughout his entire election, and he continues to do this now.For instance, right after the Trump University settlement came out, where Trump seemingly admitted to fraud by paying out $25 million, he quickly went crazy on Twitter attacking the Broadway hit musical Hamilton and Saturday Night Live to shift the focus to that instead. He knows he s going to be scrutinized, so he s masterfully figured out how to control what is scrutinized.Some people, however, are figuring this all out. Albeit, a little too late, because Trump already manipulated himself into the White House.For example, Adam Khan just tweeted out:Hey journalists distracted by Trump's Hamilton shenanigans!He lied to Federal Election Commission-underreported his debt to Bank of China https://t.co/iFHvDjwhPY  Adam Khan (@Khanoisseur) November 20, 2016Then explaining it further:New: Trump owes $650 million to Bank of China, Goldman Sachs -more than TWICE the amount he has publicly claimed pic.twitter.com/z8N1HCYwmH  Adam Khan (@Khanoisseur) August 20, 2016Now, under normal circumstances, that alone would have disqualified Mr. Trump from running for office, yet this year was anything but normal.While Hillary Clinton was treated by the media like the spawn of Satan for having a private server at home like many, many people and businesses do for security purposes, Trump was able to get away with admitting to sexual assault, not showing his taxes, having a fraud case going to court, insulting the disabled and prisoners of war, being as racist and misogynistic as his heart desired, and he was still untouchable.Until the media stops allowing themselves to be manipulated by Trump, nothing is going to change.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Following a traumatic Election Night and Donald Trump s unexpected win (of the electoral college), Democrats have been scrambling to figure out what went wrong. Beyond finding out where polling malfunctioned, liberals are struggling to understand what has happened within the party and how to go about fixing it. But as usual, there are some very different ideas about where the problem lies and how to remedy the situation   even when it comes to diversity.Two very different visions for the future of the Democratic PartyAccording to Mark Lilla of the New York Times, we need to quit focusing on our individual identities if we hope to save the Democratic party. In his piece The End of Identity Liberalism, he writes that we have been taught to celebrate  our differences. However, he argues that  this is a splendid principle of moral pedagogy   but disastrous as a foundation for democratic politics in our ideological age. In recent years American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing. Our focus on teaching diversity in schools, Lilla said,  has produced a generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self-defined groups, and indifferent to the task of reaching out to Americans in every walk of life. Lilla said that Hillary Clinton s great mistake was appealing to each individual group, which left out the white working class. National politics in healthy periods is not about  difference,  it is about commonality. And it will be dominated by whoever best captures Americans  imaginations about our shared destiny. He rejected the  whitelash  theory but also failed to acknowledge the blatant racism of Trump s campaign. He writes,  the whitelash thesis is convenient because it absolves liberals of not recognizing how their own obsession with diversity has encouraged white, rural, religious Americans to think of themselves as a disadvantaged group whose identity is being threatened or ignored. However, Lilla said nothing about the racism, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia that was the basis of Trump s campaign. Trump used the racial tensions that resulted from having a black man in the white house and stoked the fires of bigotry. From the first day Trump announced that he was running for president, he used xenophobia to rally white America behind him. He was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan and has now installed a white nationalist as his chief strategist.Trump never, at any point, offered a real plan for  making America great again  other than to promise that he would make life hell for anybody who isn t a straight white Christian male. But bigotry was enough to rally white America behind him.Lilla then warned that  Liberals should bear in mind that the first identity movement in American politics was the Ku Klux Klan, which still exists. Those who play the identity game should be prepared to lose it.  He concludes that  we need a post-identity liberalism,  and argued that taking on the concerns of specific minorities can be risky.We need a post-identity liberalism, and it should draw from the past successes of pre-identity liberalism. Such a liberalism would concentrate on widening its base by appealing to Americans as Americans and emphasizing the issues that affect a vast majority of them. It would speak to the nation as a nation of citizens who are in this together and must help one another. As for narrower issues that are highly charged symbolically and can drive potential allies away, especially those touching on sexuality and religion, such a liberalism would work quietly, sensitively and with a proper sense of scale. (To paraphrase Bernie Sanders, America is sick and tired of hearing about liberals  damn bathrooms.)Steve Phillips at the Nation has a radically different solution to what he feels is the problem facing progressives, as he wrote in his article, It s Time to Diversify the Democratic Party Leadership. And this picture says it all:Phillips explains that  nearly the entire top level of progressive leadership that controlled $1.5 billion in spending was made up of white people.   All of the individuals in the above table are good people, but none of them are from the hood. They don t hang out in black barbershops and beauty salons. They don t feel their hearts race when they see a police car s lights shining in their rear view mirror. They don t have family facing deportation to Mexico. They ve never been told to  go back to where you came from,  called a racial slur, or told to speak English. They ve never been detained at an airport because they look suspicious. They haven t lived the experiences of the people who comprise almost half of all Democratic voters.To win elections in an increasingly multiracial nation requires leadership and top staff who come from, understand, and are committed to the rapidly growing communities of color that are transforming the composition of the country. Whereas Lilla says we need to move away from identity, Phillips argues that now is the time, more than ever, to embrace our diversity at the top level of the Democratic party s leadership.  As last week s election revealed, the foundation of the Democratic home is structurally unsound. The time is now to focus on and fix the problem, and the first step in that direction is putting in place party leadership who understand how to build power and win elections in a racially combustible environment,  Phillips concluded.I tend to think it is a mixture of both these philosophies. Without a doubt, we need more diversity at the top. Even though Lilla got so much wrong, he was right in that we must find the common threads that unite us all as Americans. Yet, it is impossible to do that without acknowledging individuality and cultural diversity. To do that, we must do exactly as Phillips said and make sure the leadership of our party reflects the ever more diverse makeup of the country.Featured image via insurestory.com""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""One of Trump s biggest campaign promises was to create jobs, and right now his plan is a massive, trillion-dollar infrastructure program. Sounds fantastic, right? Sure, it ll cost money, but it ll mean thousands of jobs and we get our crumbling infrastructure back into shape. Sweet!Or not, says former Obama adviser Ron Klain. Those trillions won t be poured directly into projects   they ll go to investors who then may or may not back needed infrastructure projects. Klain oversaw the implementation of President Obama s  Recovery Act  of 2009 and knows a thing or two about this, and he believes Trump s plan is actually a massive trap: Trump s plan provides tax breaks to private-sector investors who back profitable construction projects. These projects (such as electrical grid modernization or energy pipeline expansion) might already be planned or even underway. There s no requirement that the tax breaks be used for incremental or otherwise expanded construction efforts; they could all go just to fatten the pockets of investors in previously planned projects. How bloody fantastic   more tax cuts for the rich. In other words, the plan may or may not create jobs for Americans. It may or may not actually give us the influx of dollars we need to repair our decaying infrastructure. It s a very pretty Mardi Gras mask placed over what s basically more government welfare for the rich and powerful.In fact, Klain points out that there s no guarantee that this will create jobs because there s no requirement that those dollars go to unfunded projects. He also says that it s not likely to go to projects that aren t profitable for investors, such as expanding and rebuilding water grids or repairing existing roads and bridges.These investors could see up to $85 billion apiece with which they have to do nothing. Without the necessary strings, those trillion dollars will effectively be flushed down the toilet while rich investors make themselves richer.And Democrats jumping on board with this plan are busy collecting their 30 pieces of silver. According to Klain, it didn t go so well for them when they backed either Ronald Reagan s or George W. Bush s tax cut plans because ultimately, those plans increased inequality and blew holes in the federal budget. Democrats sold themselves out on those plans, though, and they re selling out again on this one.Worse, though, Trump s infrastructure plan could actually open the door to Republicans who want to weaken things like wage protection and union representation for construction workers. Both of these will badly harm Americans, including, and perhaps especially, the white working class.Democrats are taking a lot of heat over an idea that they needed to focus far more heavily on white, rural America during the election, and some Democrats have jumped on the Trump train s infrastructure ideas and are calling it a  jobs plan.  Except it s not, and it will probably hurt the working class even more. At the bare minimum, it won t help them, and then they ll blame Democrats for it because reasons.They ll blame Democrats if Trump s infrastructure plan doesn t go through, too. In other words, Democrats can t win for losing, even though Trump is the cartoon villain who deserves to have this land squarely on his head like a piano or a giant anvil.Trump s setting us up for a trillion dollar failure. All he and the Republicans care about are enriching the already rich. Klain is right.

Therefore, when Trump s vice president-elect Mike Pence showed up to see the popular Broadway musical Hamilton, it is no surprise that the audience booed him.

Dixon reminded Pence of his responsibility to represent every single person in the nation, and to stand up for the rights of all. The speech was not mean-spirited or vindictive, but it was absolutely what Pence needed to hear.

At this point in the show, I had something else we were going to cover, but I scrapped it because there s a thing I feel like I need to say about the Mike Flynn security announcement,  Maddow said.Maddow explained that no one, such as Congress, has to approve this appointment in any way. Trump makes the offer and if Flynn accepts, then boom, it s a done deal. She then told America just why it is that this is such concerning news. So, this Mike Flynn thing is done,  Maddow explained.  But the choice of Mike Flynn is a different kettle of fish than anything we might have expected from the Trump campaign. Mike Flynn calls Islam a political ideology hiding behind a religion. He calls Islam a malignant cancer. He really did sit next to President Putin and take money to go to a gala. He s been a frequent guest on Russian state television, and says he sees no difference between Russian state television, and for example, MSNBC. After laying out her list of reasons why Flynn shouldn t be considered for any government position, let alone at the top of national security, Maddow explained to viewers what he will be doing in this position if he accepts it. He will now be the closest person to the president on a day-to-day basis on all foreign policy issues, on all military issues, on all national security issues, and he is way outside anything that anybody on the left, right or center might consider to be the mainstream, either in thought or temperament in terms of national security issues, and it s done,  Maddow said.Maddow laid out Flynn s shady business dealings with Turkey. She also slammed his habit of handing out classified information that he wasn t even supposed to have in the first place, which has happened at least twice. Two former government officials with direct knowledge of the issue tell CNN that while Flynn oversaw intelligence in Afghanistan, he shared classified information with Pakistan on terror networks responsible for killing American troops,  CNN recalled this week when Flynn s name was floated.  The intelligence, the sources say, came from another agency. Flynn wasn t supposed to share it. They say he was trying to convince Pakistan to stop sheltering terrorists.

Sessions is a guy who couldn t even get confirmed as a federal judge by the United States Senate in 1986 because he was too racist. Well, progressive firebrand and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is having none of it, and is demanding that Trump dump Sessions.Senator Warren issues a blistering statement rebuking both Sessions and Trump, which read: Instead of embracing the bigotry that fueled his campaign rallies, I urge President-elect Trump to reverse his apparent decision to nominate Senator Sessions to be Attorney General of the United States. If he refuses, then it will fall to the Senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation and all of its people. Thirty years ago, a different Republican Senate rejected Senator Sessions  nomination to a federal judgeship. In doing so, that Senate affirmed that there can be no compromise with racism; no negotiation with hate. Today, a new Republican Senate must decide whether self-interest and political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing what is right. The heart of this statement is what is important; after all, we know that Trump has not the moral character to realize why picking Sessions, white nationalist Steve Bannon, or any of the other appalling people in his inner circle to fill out his administration is such a huge problem. Therefore, it will be up to the Senate to do their jobs and to deny Sessions his confirmation. Unfortunately, Bannon s appointment is all in Trump s hands, so he s in the White House for the long haul. However, Sessions is a different story. Therefore, the Senators who are elected to represent ALL of the people need to do their jobs and reject the bigots Trump is busily nominating.I know that Donald Trump values loyalty above all else   that goes back to the undeniable fact that he has serious authoritarian tendencies. Sessions has been loyal, and this job is his reward. However, one of the most important jobs of the Attorney General is to enforce civil rights laws and to protect minorities. Therefore, Sessions would be an absolute threat to minorities in that role.

Tyson s not the only one to share that concern.Scientific researchers across the nation are concerned about the fact that Trump, who s a climate change denier and has expressed doubts about the efficacy of vaccines, will do some serious damage to scientific progress in the coming years. More than anything, scientists are concerned with Trump s stated desire to cut funding to agencies like the National Institute of Health, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Education (which helps train future scientists) and the Department of Energy.While it s doubtful Tyson would actually grab Trump s crotch, it s even more doubtful that our nation s most famous astrophysicist would ever get an audience with the new President Elect. Most of Tyson s followers were all for it, but some, as captured by New Century Times, were not.The tweet has since been removed from Twitter.

David Petraeus.And that s why Trump would be a hypocrite if he actually offered him either significant government posts. But he is doing exactly that.Back in 2012, Petraeus infamously resigned as Director of the CIA after it was revealed that he had been engaged in an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, whom he gave access to eight  Black Books  filled with highly classified information, which included  the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities and mechanisms, diplomatic discussions,  and discussions he had with President Obama.It was such a terrible breach in national security that the Justice Department wanted to prosecute him for committing a felony, and would have if Petraeus had not agreed to a plea deal in 2015.So while Hillary Clinton was doing nothing different from what other Secretaries of State have done, it s pretty clear that what Petraeus did makes him the real threat to national security.And it s unclear if he could even get the security clearance necessary for a Secretary of State or Defense to have in order to do the job.

Darkness is good,  Bannon said.  Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That s power. Satan is the evil ruler of Hell according to Christians, so Christians should probably start wondering if they put the anti-Christ in the White House.Darth Vader is a particularly bad choice to compare oneself to considering how much the Nazis influenced the themes and designs of Star Wars, including Vader s helmet, the Stormtroopers, and how democracy was turned over to a tyrant with applause.So it s definitely an eerie comparison that may be serving as a shout-out to neo-Nazis.And Dick Cheney is a war criminal who signed off on torture and lied us into two wars that cost thousands of American lives and trillions of dollars.Bannon claimed that he  isn t a white nationalist  but said that Trump s tenure in office will  be as exciting as the 1930s.

Mike Pompeo is a right-wing extremist who has no problem violating human and civil rights.But Donald Trump just picked the Kansas Republican to be the next director of the CIA, which should deeply disturb every American.In fact, it should worry everyone around the world because the Tea Party is now in charge of America s top intelligence agency. I am honored to have been given this opportunity to serve and to work alongside President-elect Donald J. Trump to keep America safe,  Pompeo said in a statement.  I also look forward to working with America s intelligence warriors, who do so much to protect Americans each and every day. But Pompeo isn t a reasonable man who will guide the CIA to success. He s going to lead them down a path that will erode the rights of American citizens and inflame the Muslim world.First, Pompeo supports the massive wire-tapping and information collecting being performed by the National Security Agency. I am convinced that intelligence collection actions are not only lawful and constitutional, but also consistent with the critical mission of defeating radical Islamic terrorism,  Pompeo has said.Of course, these  collection actions  are totally unconstitutional because the NSA doesn t have warrants to spy on millions of Americans every day via phone, Internet, and surveillance.Second, Pompeo hates Iran and opposed the nuclear deal achieved by President Obama that has reduced Iran s capability to build nuclear weapons. If Pompeo had his way, the whole deal would be ripped up, which would give Iran another reason to hate us and resume their quest to obtain a nuclear weapon.And finally, Pompeo is a big fan of using torture against enemy combatants even though it s a crime against humanity that is banned under United States and international law. The information we learned from the enhanced interrogation program was important, and led directly to the capture of Osama bin Laden,  Pompeo claimed in 2014. But that s a lie. Torture did not help us find Osama bin Laden.According to Mother Jones,CIA records indicate that: (1) the CIA had extensive reporting on [bin Laden courier] Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti (variant Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti), the UBL facilitator whose identification and tracking led to the identification of UBL s compound and the operation that resulted in UBL s death, prior to and independent of information from CIA detainees; (2) the most accurate information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti obtained from a CIA detainee was provided by a CIA detainee who had not yet been subjected to the CIA s enhanced interrogation techniques; and (3) CIA detainees who were subjected to the CIA s enhanced interrogation techniques withheld and fabricated information about Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti.In short, torture had nothing to do with finding bin Laden.If Pompeo and Trump authorize the CIA to use torture again it will only inflame the Middle East and give ISIS a recruiting message that will draw more fighters to their group. We want to weaken ISIS, not make them stronger. Using torture will only weaken our moral high ground and cause more terrorist attacks around the world and in the United States. Now more than ever we need a responsible CIA director who will gather intelligence the right way. Because if not, we could end up being led into more wars and a darker more dangerous world.Featured Image: Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

At that time, he was one of two judicial nominees whose selections were halted by the panel in nearly 50 years.In testimony before the committee, former colleagues said that Mr. Sessions had referred to the N.A.A.C.P., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other civil rights groups as  un-American  and  Communist-inspired.  An African-American federal prosecutor then, Thomas H. Figures, said Mr. Sessions had referred to him as  boy  and testified that Mr. Sessions said the Ku Klux Klan was fine  until I found out they smoked pot.  Mr. Sessions dismissed that remark as a joke.Mr. Sessions was also accused of speaking disparagingly of the Voting Rights Act and the stringent oversight it placed on Southern states.So we can expect Sessions to ignore civil rights laws as Attorney General since he will likely direct the Justice Department to turn a blind eye towards civil rights violations across the country, thus giving racists the opportunity to treat minorities however they please. It s going to be a racist free-for-all.It also likely he will refuse to stand in the way of Republican efforts to suppress minority voters while fighting anti-discrimination laws tooth and nail.Make no mistake, Trump s Justice Department is going to be full of racists and Sessions will be the top racist in charge.Featured image via Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

According to police, 32-year-old Andria Richardson was being attacked by her boyfriend, 30-year-old Ryan Gilliken, on Wednesday when Weldon drew a firearm in an attempt to defend the woman. Unfortunately, his bravado did not work out well for anyone but the assailant.Weldon fired his weapon multiple times, hitting Richardson in the stomach twice and the leg three times. Richardson is recovering from her wounds, but family members say she is lucky. Notably, neither the attacker nor the  savior were injured by the gunfire.Last year, another  good guy with a gun  made headlines when he tried to help a carjacking victim by shooting the people stealing her car. He missed the criminals, but shot the victim in the head.It s nice to think of people with a firearm as heroes who will be there to save us when things go bad   but the thing is that the average gun owner is not trained or conditioned to handle, say, close-range combat against an unarmed attacker (with a victim nearby), without causing some form of  collateral damage.

And there s still a Senate race in Louisiana that has gone to a runoff, to be held on Dec. 10. John Kennedy and Foster Campbell are both up for that particular seat, and should it go to Campbell, the Democrat, it would close that margin even more.Think it can t happen because Louisiana is a deep-red state? They elected a Democratic governor just last year after Republican Governor Bobby Jindal ran them into the ground. Also, their runoffs, despite deciding who actually wins an election, have pretty low turnout. If people in the state are unhappy enough with Trump and with the GOP, those people could turn out for the runoff and swing it to Campbell s side easily.Okay, so that s just one seat and Republicans would still control the Senate with a 51-46 margin. There are two independents Senators Bernie Sanders and Angus King who both tend to vote with the Democrats, so 51-48, with one uncalled race. Should Campbell win, that s effectively a 51-49 margin.We can math, and so can you, so we all know 49 is less than 51. To achieve a majority, someone else has to switch sides. Oddly enough, that isn t exactly impossible, either. Senator John McCain has already made it clear he s not going to play ball with everything Trump wants to do. In fact, McCain is more than a little annoyed over Trump s bromance with Vladimir Putin. To McCain, Putin is a dictatorial tyrant to whom we absolutely should not cozy up:That could mean bucking his own party to the point where he just switches sides.Evidently, Rand Paul and Susan Collins may be ripe for flipping, too, and if even one of them does, along with McCain, then voila! Democrats effectively control the Senate again!However, it s pretty far-fetched. Campbell could easily win the Louisiana seat but getting Republican Senators to change sides, and either vote pretty much entirely Democratic or actually become Democrats, is considerably harder in today s partisan environment. That means hoping and praying the GOP Senators who are all  principled  right now stay principled enough to thwart their party and Donald Trump if and when it comes to that.In short, don t hold your breath. But don t give up hope, either. We didn t think Trump could win, and he did, and there are a lot of Republicans and conservatives who are just as unhappy with that as we are. Since the next four years started off with the nearly impossible, then hoping for more  impossibilities  may not be in vain.If you would like to help Campbell win his runoff election and give the Democrats another seat in the Senate, you can donate to his campaign here.

Who knows. He ll promise to, because to do otherwise would be to confirm that some people don t matter, even if they voted for him. Will he actually do it, though?

From WackyLeaks interfering to hackers to exit polling contradicting election results to voter suppression to FBI director James Comey s bizarre and vague letter he sent to Congress just 11 days before voters cast their ballots.Trump s former presidential campaign manager admitted late Wednesday that the president-elect won the keys to the White House because the FBI renewed its examination of Hillary Clinton s private email server, according to The Hill. With eleven days to go, something amazing happened,  Corey Lewandowski said, The Telegraph reports. The FBI s director James [Comey] came out on a Friday and he said they may be reopening the investigation into  Crooked Hillary s  emails,  he said. What that did was remind people that there are two different rules in Washington   those of the elites and the privileged, and those for everybody else,  he continued. When Comey moved forward with that investigation  it allowed the campaign a little spring in their step, and for them to redouble their efforts,  he said. In those last last eleven days Mr Trump was exceptionally disciplined. He used a teleprompter  he said, without one bit of irony. Trump blasted others for using a teleprompter then used one  himself. And then, Donald Trump won the election campaign by the largest majority since Ronald Reagan in 1984,  Lewandowski added without noting that Hillary Clinton s lead in the popular vote could reach more than 2 million votes.After Comey sent Congress the letter, he took until two days before Election Day to say his bureau would not change its earlier conclusion. In other words, Comey s assertion that something  pertinent  might be in Anthony Weiner s emails was a big fat lie. Comey did that to interfere with our country s election process. The FBI director was blasted by Democrats and some Republicans as well. It was a stunningly obvious tactic to put Donald Trump into power.Corey Lewandowski is expected to be offered a key position in the Trump administration.Yes, the election was  rigged.

Fortunately, it was all caught on video by another Starbucks customer, Jorge de C rdenas.The Starbucks was crowded, as many are at any given point during any given day. The white Trump (complete with Trump-like hair and a tall, leggy blonde companion who would surely win the approval of the President Elect) voter, though, thought he deserved to get his coffee faster than the others, and if he didn t, it had to be because Starbucks employees, some of whom happen to have dark skin, hate white people.The man was, by his standards, anyway, waiting too long in line, so he started screaming  Trump!  at an African-American employee.

According to Fox Q13, the law  would allow felony prosecution of protesters who block streets, cause property damage, threaten jobs and put public safety at risk. State Senator Doug Ericksen, who proposed the legislation, insists that he  respects  the right to protest,  but when it endangers people s lives and property, it goes too far. Fear, intimidation and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression,  he continued.  Those who employ it must be called to account. Breaking the law would be considered a felony and would apply to any protester who is accused of trying to  intimidate or coerce private citizens or the government by obstructing economic activity  and  those who fund, organize, sponsor or otherwise encourage others to commit acts of economic terrorism. Accomplices may be required to pay restitution up to triple the amount of economic damage. We are not just going after the people who commit these acts of terrorism,  Ericksen said.  We are going after the people who fund them. Wealthy donors should not feel safe in disrupting middle class jobs. In other words, Republicans are literally trying to classify acts of civil disobedience as  terrorism  in order to ruthlessly put down the mass protests against their fascist leader.Of course, if Hillary Clinton had won the election, Republicans would not being saying the same thing about right-wing protests, even if those protests included acts of bloody violence that Trump supporters threatened to use if Trump had lost. Somehow, they believe rebellion and armed government coups are patriotic, but they consider civil disobedience an act of terrorism.As Doug Honig of the Washington ACLU explained, if this kind of law had been in place during the protests against segregation, every black person who sat down at a  white s only  lunch counter to protest discrimination would have been charged with committing terrorism. That s the kind of excessive approach to peaceful protest that our country and state do not need,  Honig explained.  Let s keep in mind that civil rights protesters who sat down at lunch counters could be seen as  disrupting business  and  obstructing economic activity,  and their courageous actions were opposed by segregationists as trying to  coerce business and government. So this is the latest strategy Republicans are looking to employ to silence people who disagree with them and it would drastically restrict the right to protest to the point of elimination. But again, this law would not apply to right-wingers who openly protest through displaying or using firearms in order to scare and intimidate. This law is solely aimed at protesters who disagree with them. It s the very definition of political retaliation and is the beginning of a concerted Republican effort to rip up the Constitution and replace it with fascism.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

However, the media insisted on giving him and his outrageous travesty of a campaign billions of dollars in free advertising, and refused to convey one simple fact to the American people: Donald Trump is in no way fit to president and Commander-in-Chief. In fact, he is dangerously unfit. Trump is clearly a narcissist, unbelievably vengeful and vicious, and in many ways seems to be VERY mentally unstable and unable to control his impulses. Despite these obvious traits that would make anyone unsuited to be president, America has elected him, and now we re in grave danger. The worst part of it? The media is rushing to normalize him once again, and with that normalization comes more danger than ever. Therefore no matter how much the media tells us to do so, no matter how many politicians tell us to do so, we must resist the normalization of this absolutely abnormal presidency. There s one person who is doing an amazing job of telling us just what we need to hear and understand: Keith Olbermann.On GQ s The Closer, Keith Olbermann has been busily railing Donald Trump in ways the mainstream media refuses to do. Now that Trump is the president-elect, he has come out with a brilliant video called  The Resistance  in which he explains the grave danger we are in, and why Trump must be resisted every step of the way. First, Olbermann says that he himself will help lead those of us who understand how dangerous Trump is: Since no Democratic or liberal politician has yet stepped forward out of the morass of Politics, Inc. to take on the responsibility of The Resistance, I, with complete awareness of the presumptuousness and arrogance of this statement, volunteer myself, and I will gladly turn over all these burdens to any more legitimate and informed lawmaker or political or cultural leader who has the guts to take these burdens. Then, Olbermann goes on to lay into Trump in spectacular fashion, laying out all of the reasons he cannot be accepted, and how we might go about making sure we never accept him as president: The first step is to complete the de-legitimizing of his presidency and his election. De-legitimizing that he himself began. Sixty-eight days until his inauguration, still bitching about his paranoid fantasies about the media, still lying about what he said during the campaign, still referring to himself in the third person, still obsessing over one newspaper  as if he were fifteen and it had refused to go with him to the junior prom. Give him a chance? What, in the hope that he will someday grow up enough to be able to see over the top of the Oval Office desk? Most importantly, Olbermann then reminds us all just what the people insisting we should give Trump a chance are really saying: All we are saying is, give fascism a chance.   Who knows, it might not be as bad as we think. It might not be a bottomless pit. After that, the bombastic host lays out his best zinger yet, though he is completely serious: We do not have time for the White House edition of  Celebrity Apprentice  starring President-elect P*ssy-grabber. Olbermann does warn against any crazy and/or illegal tactics, though, saying: I do not want violence, I m not proposing the overthrow of the government by any means other than legal and political. I think protests should be limited to Washington, Trump Tower and the Trump hotels. I have no pie-in-the-sky plan to have the Electoral College alter the outcome somehow, I will even acquiesce to a President Pence   just get this man out of here. Keith Olbermann is right. We need the truth here, and the truth is that this is how fascim takes over. We cannot allow Trump to become normalized, and we cannot, not for a second, treat him as any sort of legitimate president. To do so is to see the end of democracy as we know it.Mr. Olbermann, I salute you, and I proudly join your resistance to Donald Trump.Here is the must watch video, and I urge you to subscribe to the GQ YouTube channel, where  The Resistance  will be a regular series to help us all navigate the Donald Trump fascist rule.[ad3media campaign= 1356 ]Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

That possibility has an awful lot of bad implications, including shutting down sidewalks and parts of streets near Trump Tower. It seems, though, that we don t even have to wait for him to be sworn in to witness the effects of his selfish plans. New York City is already seeing them.His already-excessive presence in NYC is actually starting to cripple businesses in the area. The area around Trump Tower, which is also home to some of the nation s biggest retailers, has been swarming with security, Secret Service, and protesters. Entire sections of 5th Avenue get shut down in order to protect King Summer Squash from all the baddies who might be out and about around there.The retailers in trouble include places like Tiffany & Co., Hollister, Polo Ralph Lauren, and Abercrombie & Fitch. Their 5th Avenue stores aren t just their highest-volume locations, they re the flagship stores for all these chains and they depend heavily on the traffic they now aren t getting.Worse, because Trump wants to spend so much time in his grossly ostentatious, gold-plated apartment throughout his term, these stores may face this most, if not every single, weekend for the next four years. Their weekend traffic is very likely much higher than their weekday traffic, for obvious reasons.Tiffany & Co. s main entrance has been closed since Election Day because of protests and the security needed to keep Trump safe. They wouldn t comment on whether their traffic or sales volumes have been affected, and neither would anybody else, but Tiffany doesn t know when or if their 5th Avenue entrance will open again.RBC Capital Markets analyst, Brian Tunick, mentioned that there s a traffic risk there, along with Hollister and Abercrombie & Fitch, due to the security issues.Sure, some people might say,  Oh, these are national chains, so what s the big deal?  The big deal is that there are still people who work at these stores who could lose their jobs if these locations see too much of a drop in sales volume. Trump is a man who promised to bring back the good jobs and ensure Americans have good-paying jobs if he was elected.While there s no guarantee right now that anybody will lose jobs at these stores, there also isn t any guarantee anymore that they won t. Any job losses, or worse, store closures, because of the Cheeto King s need to be at home instead of the White House, where he belongs, will be on his head because he cares more about himself and his comfort than what his presence might do to the areas surrounding his homes.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The alt-right is isolationist. Washington conservatives are hawkish. More significantly, as the Washington Post put it:Constitutional conservatives can t stand the alt-right. Conservatives   real conservatives   believe that only a philosophy of limited government, God-given rights and personal responsibility can save the country. And that creed is not bound to race or ethnicity. Broad swaths of the alt-right, by contrast, believe in a creed-free, race-based nationalism, insisting, among other things, that birth on American soil confers superiority. The alt-right sees limited-government constitutionalism as pass ; it holds that only nationalist populism on the basis of shared tribal identity can save the country. It s a movement shot through with racism and anti-Semitism.Not this year. Donald Trump has effectively normalized the underbelly of racism. While Congress for years has been hinting at their own racism with their refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of our first African-American President, few have admitted their racism, until now.If you still aren t convinced, those applauding the Bannon appointment include former KKK leader David Duke and the chairman of the Nazi Party. Nearly every civil rights group opposed the appointment.When Democrats wrote the letter, signed by 169 members of Congress, to fire Bannon, not a single Republican was brave enough or had enough integrity to agree that a white nationalist shouldn t be in the White House.Here s one of the key passages:Since the election there have been a number of incidents across the country in which minorities, including Muslim-Americans, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Jewish-Americans have been the targets of violence, harassment and intimidation. Mr. Bannon s appointment sends the wrong message to people who have engaged in those types of activities, indicating that they will not only be tolerated, but endorsed by your administration. Millions of Americans have expressed fear and concern about how they will be treated by the Trump administration, and your appointment of Mr. Bannon only exacerbates and validates their concerns.Very proud to be leading 169 Members of Congress asking @realDonaldTrump to rescind his appointment of alt-right leader Steve Bannon. pic.twitter.com/JSz9IPT9Gv  ((David Cicilline)) (@davidcicilline) November 16, 2016There is little political fallout from disavowing a white nationalist, at least you d think, but the Republican voters have proven that racism and white supremacy no longer belong in the closet. The mostly white Republicans in Congress might still keep pretending that they aren t as racist as their party s President Elect, but their failure to sign this letter was really all we needed to know.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They treated Trump s campaign as a joke for the better first half of it, likely not thinking he would get as far as he has. He was entertainment. People tuned into to see whatever crazy thing Trump said next. Unlike his competition, pretty much every rally was televised, he had endless interviews and free air time, and he was sensationalized beyond comprehension.No one was really calling out the awful things he was saying in the mainstream media   that was left to those on Twitter on the liberal blogosphere. Ironically, the same liberal blogosphere that is being blamed for his win and dubbed  fake news  by those who don t like to admit its honest relevancy. They were some of the only ones to highlight how horrific Trump actually is.Cornering Jake Tapper of CNN at Los Angeles International Airport was none other than TMZ. They asked Tapper about the media s role in the election, and he responded: Well, that s an extremely loaded question. I think there were a lot of media mistakes this season in all sorts of directions. I think polling needs to be re-examined quite a bit. Adding: This is probably a subject for a three-hour dissertation, not an airport drive-by. Certainly there s a lot of people whose behavior and professionalism this election season should be re-examined, thinking about how to do better and how to be better. That s saying it lightly. The mainstream media didn t do its job. They propped Trump up on a pedestal but at the same time never took him seriously enough to properly criticize the horrifying things he consistently said.

Reuters reports:Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped write tough immigration laws in Arizona and elsewhere, said in an interview that Trump s policy advisers had also discussed drafting a proposal for his consideration to reinstate a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries.Kobach, who media reports say is a key member of Trump s transition team, said he had participated in regular conference calls with about a dozen Trump immigration advisers for the past two to three months.Trump s transition team did not respond to requests for confirmation of Kobach s role. The president-elect has not committed to following any specific recommendations from advisory groups.The National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, designed in part by Kovach under the Bush administration, was an ineffective program that singled out Muslims and did not manage to convict a single person of anything related to terrorism.During his campaign, Trump suggested not only monitoring mosques but added that there would need to be a  lot of systems  that extend  beyond databases  to keep an eye on Muslims.Kobach says that he and other advisers are also looking into how to get the construction of the border wall moving without approval from Congress. He says it can happen by reappropriating existing funds, but acknowledges  that future fiscal years will require additional appropriations.

Chris Collins (R-NY) on  New Day  on Wednesday morning when he dared to ask Collins what he thought about Trump s recent onslaught of tweets against the New York Times, who Trump has been blasting for making him look bad.TwitterCuomo asked if this was presidential behavior: Do you think that this is a healthy way for him to govern going forward? Collins, who was the first member of Congress to give Trump his endorsement, gave an answer that took Cuomo by complete surprise when he shrugged Trump s behavior off and said it was just the President-elect s way of  relaxing. Well, I can tell you this, the pressure that has got to be on President-elect Trump is immense. The enormity of the job ahead of him, and so I would have to say if this is his way of relaxing, god bless him. Cuomo fired back,  Relaxing?!  in complete disbelief. Collins said: Absolutely. If this is what he has some fun with and he finds this relaxing, and his entertainment, let him go with it. Uh  isn t a President supposed to be more concerned with running a country than  entertainment ? Apparently not, according to Collins: I would not second-guess anything he s doing that he would use to make himself call it unwinding, relaxing, and I think that s part of it. It s Donald Trump being Donald Trump. You don t want this stuff all bottled up. So frankly I don t have a problem with this in the least. I think America actually wants to continue to see a real human being in the White House, and I put this in to the you know, this is his way of unwinding, and taking some stress off.

As if that weren t bad enough, it is being reported that anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney will be named as a national security adviser.If you don t know who this guy is, let me clue you in. Gaffney believes that President Obama is a Muslim born in Kenya, and regularly peddles this debunked nonsense on his radio show. He also once suggested that the Obama Administration s Missile Defense Agency logo was proof that the president was trying to usher in Sharia Law. As if that isn t enough, Gaffney also thinks that the Muslim Brotherhood is somehow roving around in the United States government.If there s any indication as to what sort of advice Gaffney might give, it s his post-election statement to the alt-right cesspool that is Breitbart News Daily, which is that we have to commit to  stopping, designating, rolling up the Muslim Brotherhood in America as the terrorist organization it is.  He went on to say: It s going to be vital to everything else he s trying to do. We ve got to stop taking counsel from them, direction from them, and allowing them to operate in our midst subversively, and that s what s been going on for some fifty years now. The only possibly redeeming quality here is that Gaffney worked in the Pentagon for a short time when Reagan was president. However, that was one hell of a long time ago, and he s been a right-wing radio host and leader of the conspiracy-minded think tank Center for Security Policy. Essentially, he has done nothing but peddle in hate, lies, and nonsense ever since he left the Reagan Administration. Further, the world is a much different and more complex place than it was when Reagan was in office, and any advice Gaffney might give would be completely obsolete in 2016.In other words, be afraid, America.

One is his use of the Secret Service. He already made nearly $3 million from them during his campaign, and now he potentially stands to make millions more over the next four years, and probably won t hesitate to do so because that s just how greedy he is.Even as far back as 2000, when Trump first started thinking about a run at the White House, he knew he could make money for himself. Back then, he combined paid speeches with his political appearances, making them paid political appearances. He actually admitted that he could be the first person to make money on the side as a presidential candidate.So what s going on now? Basically, the Secret Service has to pay for travel with candidates while they re campaigning. They paid both Trump and Hillary roughly $2.7 million each for travel. However, with Hillary, that money helped with the costs of chartering a plane, so it s not like she actually just raked it in from them.However, since Trump was using his own airline for travel, they simply paid him the money for travel. Yes, the costs associated with using those aircraft were rolled in, but Trump owns the airline. Therefore, the money essentially went into his own pocket.He and Melania will be flying around now on Air Force One and Marine One. What about their kids, though? Trump s adult children are up for unpaid positions in his administration (he can t officially hire family). Also, the Secret Service is supposed to protect immediate family, like children. Sure, they ll sometimes fly on the official presidential aircraft, but other times, they could be flying on Trump s personal aircraft, possibly still with Secret Service protection.And the Secret Service has to pay for that. It ll be the same as the campaign   that money will essentially go into Trump s coffers.No wonder he s willing to take a $1 salary as president. He sounds all wonderfully altruistic that way, but the truth his he has a huge opportunity to make millions anyway. Even the $50,000 expense account is peanuts compared to what he stands to make by fleecing the Secret Service. That makes the gesture as hollow as the CEOs with massive stock options who only take $1 salaries.

Dr. Carson was never offered a specific position, but everything was open to him,  Williams continued to say.The irony meter just exploded. Despite Trump s onslaught of attacks on Carson during the campaign, the retired neurosurgeon was among the first former rivals to back the acidic GOP presidential nominee. And now that Trump, who has zero political experience, won the keys to the White House, Carson feels his own inexperience would  cripple the presidency. Dr. Carson doesn t feel like that s the best way for him to serve the president-elect,  Williams told Reuters.He said that Carson would remain a close adviser of Trump and also a friend.  His life has not prepared him to be a Cabinet secretary,  Williams said.Well, we can t imagine how Trump is possibly prepared to lead this country will no political experience.Dr. Carson endorsed Trump by calling him thoughtful and  cerebral,  according to the Washington Post. He said that even though Trump insulted him over and over and over and over again. The same thing happened with Ted Cruz. Trump attacked Heidi Cruz s appearance so what did the Texas Senator do? He denounced Trump, then later told America to vote their conscience while he never gave in to backing the then-GOP Presidential nominee.

The way I look at it, if you are trying to take an overview   the holistic approach   we are fighting the last big major battle of the Civil War,  Reiner said, pointing out that people are protesting Trump for the opposite reason why Southerners protested Abraham Lincoln when he was elected in 1860. There s only been two times in the history of America where upon the election of a president, the people en masse took to the streets,  Reiner said.  One was Abraham Lincoln, and the other was Donald Trump. And for obviously, you know, 180-degree different reasons, but both based on race. Indeed, the South hated Lincoln because they wanted to keep the institution of slavery alive. Anti-Trump protesters hate Trump because they don t want America to be a haven for racists who want to go back to the days of slavery or segregation.Millions of Americans fear that Trump will reign over an era where racism and discrimination is acceptable and is propped up by the federal government. To me, the scariest part of what we saw with Donald Trump was not understanding how much racism still existed in this country,  Reiner continued.  It was kind of papered over for a while. I mean, we had the Civil Rights Act, we had the Voting Rights Act and then in the  70s we had  All in the Family  started shining a light on racial unrest. And then we had a lot of enormous success by African-Americans in the media, in the news and so on. And then culminating with an African American president. So we thought, OK, we are moving in the right direction, everything is moving. But what we didn t realize that this undercurrent of racism was still there, virulent and kind of down, suppressed. But now the media is largely to blame for giving Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters a platform to bring the cause of white supremacists into the mainstream. And Reiner blasted them for it. I don t know if you saw Leslie Stahl last night,  Reiner said in reference to Trump s 60 Minutes interview on Sunday.  It s embarrassing. It is embarrassing that somebody who has a national platform would softball this moron. He s a moron. And that man is in the White House now, and the press normalized him. They normalized him for a long, long time. And that s a disgrace. Trump may have won by getting more electoral votes, but he lost the popular vote which is a sign that Democrats can take back the White House from Trump and the Republicans in 2020 with a candidate who is more popular and has less baggage. Someone like Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris.So while Trump and the GOP and their racists voters will enjoy their victory now, they have ignited a progressive wave of rage that is going to bury them and drag them kicking and screaming into the future America deserves.Featured Image: Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In fact, we ll probably see some landmark legislation like the Civil Rights Act get rolled back.Make no mistake, Bannon is a racist with ties to white nationalists. But Kayleigh McEnany not only whined about Bannon being called a racist by fellow panelist Jonathan Tasini, she had the nerve to repeat the call for unity even though Republicans refused to unite behind President Obama when he asked the country to come together in 2008.The discussion began with Van Jones pointing out that if Hillary Clinton picked the editor of a Maoist publication to be her chief strategist Republicans would be throwing a hissy fit. We ve got to continue to have a serious debate about the direction of our country and that includes talking about who s put in the inner circle of the President of the United States,  Jones said.McEnany replied that  there is a line between asking a question and labeling someone a racist, which is what Jonathan just did. Van, as political commentators, we have a duty and an obligation, Van, to correct mistruths and falsehoods. We have an obligation to correct falsehoods and President Barack Obama stood up there and said it s time to unite and that means dispelling these rumors. But these are not rumors. Bannon has been flirting with the alt-right for years and it s no coincidence that white supremacists flocked to Trump s campaign because Bannon was part of it. White nationalists see Bannon as their meal-ticket to power, which makes him all the more dangerous.Anyway, Tasini was absolutely disgusted by McEnany s defense of Bannon, so he proceeded to bury her. Bannon is a racist and an anti-Semite,  Tasini said.  He s at the head of an alt-right movement that is completely anti-American, frankly. You should be ashamed of yourself that you re justifying what he s about. I m very proud of this campaign,  McEnany responded. I know you re proud and that s a disgrace,  Tasini said, driving a final stake of humiliation through McEnany s hypocrisy.Here s the video via Vid Me.Again, for eight years conservatives refused to unite behind President Obama and called him every name in the book.

While many of us are still mourning and in shock that Donald Trump was able to win the election, President Barack Obama addressed frustrated Democrats yesterday to remind them that there s still more work to be done and we can t give up now.Obama began by saying how  proud  he was of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for her  history-making race.  He said: We did not get the results we wanted, but we took a step in shattering a barrier that s still there. And little girls and little boys are going to have a different sense of the possible thanks to her nomination and her candidacy. Then, Obama got right down to business. Obama said it was fine to go through the emotions of dealing with Trump s win, but we must not lose focus and stop fighting for what we believe in. He said: That doesn t mean we don t hurt for what was an unexpected loss. Expected losses are hard enough; unexpected ones are just worse. And that s okay. I was telling my team: You re allowed to mope for a week and a half. Maybe two if you really need it. But after that, we ve got to brush ourselves off and get back to work. We need to come together and focus on a way ahead. This call was organized by the Democratic National Committee, and was held right after Obama gave his first post-election press conference. Obama had said that although Democrats might have better ideas, they were failing to resonate with voters   and this was something that needed to change. Obama said: Given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. The president urged Democrats to get back to work and move forward  in a way that s consistent with who we are as Democrats.  He said: It means that we re listening to each other, we re reflecting, we re asking tough questions, we re respectful of different points of view, we re basing our decisions on facts and careful analysis. We re taking the long view and we re strategizing.And then, Obama said something that inspired us all and gave us hope that he would still play a major role in America s future after he leaves the White House: The bottom line is: I don t know about y all, but I m still fired up and I m still ready to go.

Gerster snapped a photo of her and the Democratic nominee and innocently uploaded it to social media. That s when the sh*t hit the fan and she began receiving death threats.The photo was simply of the two women and Gerster s baby. It in no way questioned or even referenced Donald Trump s election. Instead, it was a reassurance that life goes on, even after a crushing defeat.Within what seemed like hours, the conservative media attacks began. The chance encounter had to be fake, the argument went, because Gerster had met Hillary Clinton once before, many years ago. As if people don t have chance encounters with people they have previously met.Gerster admits she met Clinton when she was a teenager, but that had nothing to do with last Wednesday s chance encounter: It was so long ago,I do not remember.

I was approached by an old white guy, maybe in his 70s, with a Trump Shirt, at Chili s on Veteran s Day yesterday,  Walker explained on Facebook.

He left to the back, and came back and rubbed my dog Barack, who is a service dog. First of all, it s incredibly disrespectful to question a person s service to this country just because of the color of their skin. Second, it s disrespectful to touch a disabled person s service animal. It s a dick move.But this Trump supporter took the extra step of going to the restaurant manager and told him that Walker was faking his veteran creds and said the service animal is fake, too.The manager, identified by Walker as Wesley Patrick, interrogated Walker and then took his food away from him even though Walker once again showed proof of his military service. I was seated and eating my food. The waitress packed the rest of my food in a to go box because I had to go pick up my wife. I got my food and tipped the waitress. Then the Manager, MR.

He asked for my military ID, I was calm, and provided it to him. I also provided him with my DD214 which is my discharge paperwork. At that point he should have just said  I am sorry Sir, thank you for your service  Instead he followed up with  the guest also said your dog is not a service dog.  Barack had his Red Service Vest on, and his Certified Service Tags. I was sitting for 35 minutes prior with Barack beforehand. At this point I was grossly offended embarrassed dehumanized and started Recording Mr. Wesley snatched my food away, made body contact.

His assessment of the current situation? In an interview with Truthout, Chomsky said electing Trump has given  total control of the government  to Republicans, who he describes as  the most dangerous organization in world history. On November 8, the most powerful country in world history, which will set its stamp on what comes next, had an election,  Chomsky said.  The outcome placed total control of the government   executive, Congress, the Supreme Court   in the hands of the Republican Party, which has become the most dangerous organization in world history. Chomsky s primary concern with Republicans is their staunch refusal to accept climate change as a reality and their determination to destroy the planet as quickly as possible. Apart from the last phrase, all of this is uncontroversial. The last phrase may seem outlandish, even outrageous. But is it? The facts suggest otherwise,  Chomsky explained.  The Party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life. There is no historical precedent for such a stand. Chomsky went on to say that humans are facing the biggest disaster in our history. Republicans, especially Trump, seem hell-bent on doing all they can to ensure our demise. It is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history   whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know   and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster,  Chomsky said.He added that when it comes to Trump,  Similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival: the threat of nuclear destruction, which has been looming over our heads for 70 years and is now increasing. Chomsky said that Trump voters were driven by their desperation for  change  and that is what Trump offered, but he noted that the  change  that Trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse.  He said that they were also driven by bigotry, citing studies which  show that doctrines of white supremacy have had an even more powerful grip on American culture than in South Africa. The political theorist said that this is exactly what he has spent years trying to warn people about. For many years, I have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the United States, someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society, and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets,  Chomsky said.  That could indeed lead to what sociologist Bertram Gross called  friendly fascism  in a perceptive study 35 years ago. But that requires an honest ideologue, a Hitler type, not someone whose only detectable ideology is Me. The dangers, however, have been real for many years, perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that Trump has unleashed. A good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers. Early indications are unattractive, to put it mildly,  Chomsky added.You can read Chomsky s full interview with Truthout, here.Featured image via William B.

This is not normal. We must be vigilant. Fear is a healthy emotion right now. So is extreme caution.Trump is trying to normalize white supremacy and the Alt-Right, which is nothing more than the new Ku Klux Klan. It s time to stop pretending that Trump s election is not a national tragedy, and stand up to him and his cronies, less we become a nation that celebrates the Jim Crow era and shuns and punishes diversity.Featured image via screen capture from YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Trump aides were described by those people as unaware that the entire presidential staff working in the West Wing had to be replaced at the end of Mr. Obama s term. After meeting with Mr. Trump, the only person to be elected president without having held a government or military position, Mr. Obama realized the Republican needs more guidance. He plans to spend more time with his successor than presidents typically do, people familiar with the matter said. To say that Trump is inexperienced is a grave understatement.

Bannon is the former CEO of Breitbart News, and Breitbart is positively reveling in Trump s win. They feel it gives them legitimacy, and Bannon s placement gives them unprecedented access to and influence over a presidential administration.The New York Times published a report on this, and Alexander Marlow, Breitbart s editor-in-chief, told them: So much of the media mocked us, laughed at us, called us all sorts of names. And then for us to be seen as integral to the election of a president, despite all of that hatred, is something that we certainly enjoy, and savor. They re thrilled now because they think this makes them legitimate. What they apparently don t see is that people laughed at and dismissed Breitbart because they became an alt-right conspiracy site, as opposed to a legit conservative media site. They want to shape narratives like everyone else, but Bannon s dictatorial rule turned them into just another InfoWars. His placement on the transition team (along with the blowjobs he probably gave Trump in order to get on the campaign) makes this dangerous.It opens a very wide door to a state-run media outlet. Throughout his entire campaign, Trump vilified any media outlet that dared criticize him. He openly and repeatedly claimed to want to open up libel laws so it would be easier to sue outlets for saying bad things about him. He only liked media outlets that gave him favorable coverage, and he wanted to burn any outlet that didn t.Make no mistake, this is a reason to be nervous. State-run media is nothing more than a government s propaganda arm, and Breitbart s newfound fame reaches a lot of people. They re even talking about expanding into Paris, Cairo, and Berlin, according to the Times report.State-run media uses a variety of methods to control information, and one that could become true here very quickly is known as  the big lie.  What is  the big lie?  According to North Korea s media, for instance, it s the idea that there s no poverty and everyone would have laid down their life for their late dictator, Kim Jong Il. The  media  even claimed that people ran into buildings damaged by a munitions explosion to save paintings of Kim before they tried saving their own family members.Who believes that actually happened and that North Korea is so prosperous under the Kims that there s no poverty? Really.Yet, Breitbart already does things like this, too. They ran unsubstantiated rumors about Hillary Clinton s health; they ve claimed the rash of hate crimes since Election Night is  fake,  and they turned their backs on one of their own reporters, Michelle Fields, after Corey Lewandowski grabbed and bruised her.Furthermore, Mike Pence himself tried to start a state-run media outlet in Indiana. He wanted it to compete with Indiana s independent media. They would even  break  stories ahead of everyone else, most likely to shape the narrative before the mainstream media had a crack at it. There s a good chance he d be on board with Breitbart being the administration s own personal propaganda machine.Then there s the liar of liars himself. Trump just lied about The New York Times again after a campaign filled with these lies:@realDonaldTrump @nytimes fact: surge in new subscriptions, print & digital, with trends, stops & starts, 4 X better than normal.  NYTCo Communications (@NYTimesComm) November 13, 2016Breitbart can easily start pushing these lies, too, and anything else they see fit. Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman who quit earlier this year, voiced worry over the idea that Breitbart was suddenly so close to the White House: It will be as close as we are ever going to have   hopefully   to a state-run media enterprise. Think it really can t happen, because we re already full of independent journalism along with a Constitutional right to a free press? Think again. The Times floated this small fact in their report: [T]he site s influence on social media, where more and more Americans now consume information, has been palpable. On election night, Breitbart s Facebook page received the fourth-highest number of user interactions on the entire platform   beating Fox News, CNN and The New York Times. If they get big enough and command a large enough audience, other media outlets could fade to irrelevance. It snowballs from there. Of course, The Times says that Breitbart s editor-in-chief totally rejects the idea that they could become Trump s own propaganda mill, which is baloney: Our loyalty is not going to be to Donald Trump; our loyalty is to our readers and to our values. That s regardless of what role Steve has.If Trump runs his administration and honors the voters who voted him in, we re all good. But if he is going to turn his back on those values and principles that drove his voters to the polls, we re going to be highly critical. We re not going to think twice about it. Trump and Bannon can quietly use Breitbart to push whatever they want. They can use its propaganda to counter what the mainstream media is saying, and people will buy it up lock, stock and barrel.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The takeaway, though, at least to them, is that there is still only one group of voters who matter in this country, and that s the white working class. The rest, according to Trump voters, should just bow down.This was the sort of behavior on display on Sunday s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, where the guests included right-wing shill Mary Matalin and liberal icon Van Jones. Needless to say, Jones didn t let Matalin go far with her condescending and downright insulting whitesplaining.After the election, Jones emotionally called the election what it was,  whitelash.  Here it is:The right, who could have chosen the magnanimous route and addressed Jones  concerns, instead chose to belittle him. Matalin did just that by telling him how, as a successful and educated black man, he should ignore racism and simply tell his fellow African-Americans that they too should bow to the white working class. Here s the transcript and video via Media Matters:MARY MATALIN: Van has, to my mind, retracted your whitelash with what you just said   No, that we have to not focus totally on the toxic stuff   OK, but you should, and if you don t you re wrong. You are not   that s not the path for progressives. We ve all agreed at the outset of this show that the path, which is Ellison s message, you say, is to go back to the rust belt and the rednecks   you re not going to get there with climate change and Putin and all the rest of  JONES: Now listen, I said and stand by it. I said that race was a part and there was a part, that alt-right part, it was a part of a whitelash. If you listened to the whole quote you would agree with what I said, so I don t take that back  MATALIN: I did listen and you said  what do I tell the kids.  What I would tell your kids,  I m a black man in America who went to Yale, who s written books, who served a president and now  JONES: And I m a ninth generation American man and I m the first one in my family born with all my rights. I m a ninth generation American, and so we have not escaped, because I went to Yale, all the problems of this country.Matalin went on to say that Jones should be a racial reconciler, not a polemicist. That s when Jones very politely and very quietly lost it.JONES: You should be ashamed of yourself for attempting to say that to my face. I have spent more time  MATALIN: Would I say it behind your back would be better?JONES: I spent more time than you have trying to be a racial reconciler in this country.MATALIN: Really? How do you know that? Do you know anything about me?JONES: Apparently you don t know anything about me.[ ]Here s the video:Trump voters need to know a few things. First off, only about a quarter of Americans voted for their candidate. Secondly, his election does not give them the moral high ground, and they certainly have not behaved well enough to lecture us on our behavior. Not that they ll listen to me. The implication with Trump s election is that for the next four years, discussions of racism and inequality are off the table. That s frightening. Any progress we ve made over the last several decades will go up in smoke.If Van Jones were any less a man, he probably would have lost his temper, and really, who could blame him. Instead, he handled being whitesplained to with class and elegance. That s so much more than Trump voters have shown him or the rest of us.Featured image via video screen capture.

He claimed he ll start deporting undocumented residents right away, but it s  okay  because it s only the criminals. What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,  Trump told  60 Minutes  correspondent Lesley Stahl, according to a preview of the interview released by CBS.  But we re getting them out of our country. They re here illegally. As for the rest of the undocumented immigrants: After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we re going to make a determination on the people that they re talking about   who are terrific people. They re terrific people, but we are gonna make a determination at that,  Trump said.  But before we make that determination it s very important, we are going to secure our border. The Washington Post notes that the Department of Homeland Security, in 2013, said there were about 1.9 million  removable criminal aliens.  That number is not just about people who are here illegally. Many are here lawfully, but have broken the law.Regardless, there are some major civil rights and logistical problems, including how do we figure out exactly who has committed crimes? It s not like they re just sitting in jail.Robert Reich asks this:Out of an estimated population of 11 million undocumented immigrants, how exactly will the government identify these people? Will there be wholesale roundups and interrogations? Anyone who looks Latino stopped and identity checked? Anonymous accusations to government agents of gang membership or drug dealing? And what is the responsibility of the rest of us   including those of us living in  sanctuary cities    to stop such abuses?Despite Trump s assertions that immigrants are criminals and rapists, they, by and large, aren t. Undocumented immigrants, for pretty obvious reasons (they don t want to attract the attention of the law) stay out of trouble. In several studies quoted by the conservative Wall Street Journal, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes and less likely to be locked up for crimes. It s not just well-educated immigrants working in Silicon Valley who stay out of trouble. It s immigrants from Latin American countries as well.Despite the fact that immigrants as criminals is just a red herring, and the real immigration problem is the fact that employers hire undocumented workers, this will put a lot of people s lives in danger.

Therefore, House Speaker Paul Ryan went on CNN s State of the Union to speak to Jake Tapper on Sunday, in which he addressed the promise of mass deportations. Ryan said: We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump is not planning on that. That s not what we re focused on. We re focused on securing the border.

They are making the claim that Trump wasn t elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that it s simply not true. Trump voters are racist and there s proof.The American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked  How likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.  Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. It s VERY unlikely that whites aren t getting jobs because minorities are, but that s not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that it s  extremely likely  that minorities are taking jobs from white people.Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon.Then, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trump s signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed.Post election, this is what the study found:The question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is  extremely likely  that whites can t find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is  not at all  likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is  extremely likely  people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who don t think that.More than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are  violent.  84 percent think that of Muslims.Unfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this:Democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As I ve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation.Great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots  claims go unchallenged.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I find Harry Reid s public comments and insults about Donald Trump and other Republicans to be beyond the pale. They re incredibly disappointing,  Conway said even though she never said the same thing about Trump when he publicly insulted a long list of people and groups during his campaign. Then she warned Reid that there could be some retaliation. He should be very careful about characterizing somebody in a legal sense. He thinks he being some kind of political pundit there, but I would say be very careful about the way you characterize it. Seriously, this is the kind of bullshit that petty tyrants display when something is said about them that they don t like.And if that weren t enough, Conway actually had the gall to attack the people who are protesting Trump. I m calling for responsibility and maturity,  Conway began despite the fact that her boss never exercised either of those during the election. The hypocrite then complained about being allegedly booed and spit on at the protests and accused the protesters of being at Trump Tower for  nefarious  reasons. You know, because she would be saying the same thing about Trump supporters had they lost the election, right? She then lectured Reid that he  has a platform to do good here,  completely ignoring the irony of her statement. For over a year, Trump has had hundreds of opportunities to use his platform  to do good here  and he squandered it. Instead, he promoted bigotry, incited violence and hate against others and was the complete opposite of a role model for children.Speaking of children, Conway had this infuriating thing to say. I want the children of America to see decency and honor from our leaders and elected officials and they re seeing that in President-elect Trump. Seriously.

During the primaries, for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. It turns out there might be a reason for that   Trump was bribing the media   at least that s the accusation being made by Megyn Kelly of Fox News.In her memoire  Settle for More,  which will be released this week, Kelly said that Trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women  fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.  That question set Trump off on one of his Twitter tirades. These are only a portion:The worst and most controversial of which was this:As the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that Trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. If they didn t, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery.While Kelly couldn t speak for other members of the media, she alleges that Trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. While the attempt clearly didn t work on Kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. This is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign: I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage,  Kelly said. He also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding,  This is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking. Trump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded,  she said.When it became obvious that some reporters were  in the tank  for Trump, she alleges in one chapter,  certain TV hosts  would work with the candidate in advance on occasional Trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. She didn t identify them by name or media outlet.Source: YahooKelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which Kelly asked about Trump s treatment of women, the candidate called Fox News exec. Bill Sammon, who told him about the first question.

And they intend to do so no matter how many millions of Americans are harmed.One particular group of women who would be harmed is women.Women benefit from Obamacare because the law prevents insurance companies from labeling them as a pre-existing condition just for being a woman. Women can also keep their children on their insurance plan until they reach the age of 26 and get easier access to birth control, which insurance companies are required to cover.One would think Republicans would be all for this last benefit, especially since better access to contraception prevents unwanted pregnancies, therefore reducing the abortion rate.But during an interview with CNN s Jake Tapper, the current Speaker of the House literally refused to confirm whether or not the birth control mandate in Obamacare is safe. I m not going to get into all the little nitty-gritty details of these things,  Ryan said, which drew a sharp rebuke from Tapper. With all due respect,  Tapper began.  I don t know that the average woman of childbearing years out there who relies upon contraception provided by health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act, I don t know that she would think that that s just a nitty-gritty detail. Ryan responded by whining. You re asking me details about legislation that hasn t been written yet!  Ryan complained.  I m not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn t even been drafted. Here s the video via YouTube:In other words, Paul Ryan basically just admitted that Republicans will kill the Obamacare birth control mandate. He s just too much of a coward to say so because he knows women will be pissed off.Women should be able to have just as much access to birth control as men do. Men should not be allowed to legislate what women are allowed to do with their bodies, and that includes the decision to use contraception. But as usual, Republicans intend to wage war on women unlike anything we ve ever seen before.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Trump himself doesn t want to work and seems to be actively avoiding it, his transition team is in chaos, and now, some of his inner circle are reportedly talking about getting revenge on Republicans who opposed him during the election.This is despite the fact that many of those Republicans are now saying that they look forward to working with him. To be sure, it s not uncommon for incoming administrations to subtly reward loyalty and just as subtly punish opposition. However, these people (probably because they re tied to Trump, who would expect no less) are being far more blatant about it: The source suggested that Trump s political operation would steer business away from Republicans who were involved in the #NeverTrump effort to block Trump from the GOP nomination. Denying opponents and critics positions within the administration is one thing. This is something entirely different. This has shades of actually trying to ruin some of the Republicans that had enough of a brain and a conscience to refuse to support Trump.And, as Trumpkins are suddenly so fond of saying, the election is over, he won, so move the fuck on. Except the Republicans who opposed Trump and  went over the line  in their opposition can now either work with Trump or basically, put up and shut up. They aren t likely to get very far in continuing to stand against him the way they did during the election cycle.This is as opposed to all the people who are legitimately frightened by the idea of a racist president who appeals to Christian bigots and white supremacists and thinks sexually assaulting women is okay. We won t be getting over it anytime soon because we re afraid, and with good reason.Trying to ruin Republicans by steering business and what-not away from them isn t the only thing they re discussing, though. There s also this: [T]he website seen as the unofficial news organ of Trump World, Breitbart News   which was co-founded by Trump s campaign chairman and possible White House chief of staff Steve Bannon   has signaled that it intends to continue its crusade against House Speaker Paul Ryan. Anybody who thinks that Bannon doesn t have anything to do with Breitbart s vendetta has another thing coming. Bannon regularly referred to Ryan as  the enemy  there, and personally made it Breitbart s mission to destroy him. The publication has gone at that task with glee and will continue to do so.Ryan, for his part, was full of praise for Trump on Election Night. He also believes their initial meeting went well. It may well have, and Ryan is probably clueless about any talk of destroying him. Or he doesn t believe Trump is directly involved, or that such efforts will even succeed.Whether there s a chance for success or not, this is scary, and it actually sounds exactly like Trump. All through the election, he felt getting revenge on people who slighted him was more important than actually running for President. So now, we ve got a man and his inner circle in the White House who seem to believe that revenge is more important than actually building an administration.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He has told them he would like to do what he is used to, which is spending time in New York when he can.The questions reflect what Mr. Trump s advisers described as the president-elect s coming to grips with the fact that his life is about to change radically. They say that Mr. Trump, who was shocked when he won the election, might spend most of the week in Washington, much like members of Congress, and return to Trump Tower or his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., or his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on weekends.In other words, Trump isn t interested in being president full-time. He wants to vacation and golf. And if he gets the schedule he wants, he would end up spending 416 days away from Washington over the course of four years. Far MORE days than the 217 days President Obama spent on vacation in eight years.And that s not even counting official vacations Trump will likely take.Furthermore, if Trump plays one round of golf every weekend, he will play more golf in two years than President Obama played during his whole first term.So while Trump is away, it s likely the responsibility of governing will be left to his advisers and cabinet members.If Donald Trump is serious about governing, he should be in Washington full-time. Also, he should never take a vacation or play a single round of golf during his term because for years, Trump and his supporters bitched every time President Obama left the White House for just about any little thing. And they definitely despised him for playing golf. Doing either of these things would make Trump a hypocrite, especially since he could end up doing more of it over four years than Obama did in eight.Featured Image: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It is now clear that she won it by a margin larger than two candidates who went on to win the presidency.David Leonhardt, a columnist for The New York Times, noted on Friday that with a 1.7-percentage-point popular vote lead over Donald Trump,Clinton will have a larger margin of victory than Richard Nixon had over Hubert Humphrey in 1968 or John F. Kennedy had over Nixon in 1960. (Her edge is also larger than Al Gore s popular vote victory over George W. Bush in 2000, though he too was stymied by an electoral college loss.)In raw numbers, that amounts to an edge of roughly 1.8 million votes as of Saturday.The election is decided by the electoral college, not the popular vote, so Trump will be sworn in to the presidency. But it s telling that even in victory, Trump s supporters must lie to themselves and each other with these completely made up stories.

Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would saying there was no there there was a real motivator for Trump s voters,  Clinton said. Essentially, the second Comey letter played right into Trump s hands by giving new suspicions to those who believed the Washington establishment was helping Clinton win and pushed a surge in turnout.  Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,  Clinton said.The former presidential candidate also said she is  concerned  and  deeply saddened  for those who say they are living in fear in the United States after Trump s election.The decision by Comey was blasted by Democrats, and even some Republicans, as it gave the appearance that Clinton was still involved in wrongdoing, even though she had been previously cleared. It also fed into the mainstream media s obsession with Clinton s emails, which they covered more than nearly any other issue during the election.By contrast, Trump s refusal to release his tax returns hardly merited coverage, by comparison, nor did the shady dealings of his personal charity, the Trump Foundation.The press, in concert with the FBI and the right wing, weighed in on the election all against one candidate.

According to a report by McClatchy, some civil rights groups say that voter suppression is what happened.Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers  Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that in hindsight,  we will find that voter suppression figured prominently in the story surrounding the 2016 presidential election. While voter suppression is hardly the only factor that brought us to this point, as McClatchy explains, it did play an important role. Fourteen states had restrictive new voting laws on the books for the first time in a presidential election this year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law: Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.The laws included a mix of photo ID requirements for voters, cuts to early voting opportunities and curbs on voter registration activity. These laws began to spread across the country after the midterm elections of 2010, supposedly to protect against voter fraud, which is virtually nonexistent by the way.The Brennan Center reports that  10 states have imposed stricter voter ID laws, seven made registration more difficult, six have cut early voting opportunities and three have made it harder to restore voting rights to people with criminal convictions.  The center explains that these laws, which have been fueled by race and partisanship, disproportionately affect minorities, the poor, and younger voters; all groups who tend to lean to the left.Clarke said on Thursday that systemic barriers weren t the only obstacles voters faced this year. Long lines at polling places, voters whose names were missing from registration lists, a lack of assistance for non-English speaking voters, and  poll workers who requested strict photo ID in states where no such ID was required  also made it much harder to cast a ballot than it should have been.Wade Henderson, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said that groups monitoring the election  have documented beyond any doubt that voter suppression and a conscious effort to shave off 1 or 2 percent of the vote in key states, in all likelihood, influenced the outcome of this election. Activists also voiced concerns about purges of  inactive  voters from registration rolls in numerous states and a drastic reduction in polling places across the country.A report by the leadership conference found that voting locations were reduced in about 43 percent   or 165   of 381 counties that were previously covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The result: There were 868 fewer sites in which to cast a ballot in those jurisdictions with histories of discriminatory voting practices.It is worth noting that many of these laws were only able to be enacted because of the gutting of the Voting Rights Act. While voter suppression is hardly the only factor responsible for Trump s win, it very well may have been what tipped the scales in his favor.Featured image via Sandbox News""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

White people, no matter how painful, have a responsibility to reject anybody who stands in front of a camera who spews racism. Who spews sexism, misogyny. Who brags about being a sexual predator. I don t care what your race is, but especially if you re white. Because that means that you belong to the race that s been in power forever.

A nonprofit that he founded and bankrolled produced the feature film  The Dog Lover,  which portrays dog breeders and puppy mills as victims of animal-rights agencies  who aren t REALLY interested in animal welfare. A review of the movie on Roger Ebert s website called it  shamelessly manipulative  and  a pretty bald piece of anti-SPCA and/or PETA propaganda. This is what the Humane Society says about Lucas:In 2010, Forrest Lucas spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to bankroll the opposition to Proposition B in Missouri, which voters approved to set common-sense standards for the care of dogs in large-scale commercial breeding operations (their statement against Prop B can be found here). Lucas then supported an effort in the Missouri legislature to weaken and repeal parts of the voter-approved measure, before it even had a chance to take effect.In 2012, Forrest Lucas spent more than a quarter-million dollars opposing Measure 5 in North Dakota, which sought to establish felony-level penalties for malicious cruelty to dogs, cats and horses.In 2013, Protect the Harvest lobbied against a local ordinance in Harrison County, Indiana, to promote the spaying and neutering of pets and help reduce pet overpopulation, and in Crawford County, Indiana, to provide adequate shelter for dogs and protect them from the elements.Trump has made his views on regulation very clear. Trump, to our knowledge, has never had a pet.

Chris Christie was heading up the transition team, but now that job has gone to Mike Pence. There s also little evidence that Trump himself is even working all that much.He couldn t run a campaign, now he can t run his transition team, so how can anybody expect him to run a country? Already, reports are coming out that he s hinting he d rather stay in his gilded castle at the top of Trump Tower, or down at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Trump s terror at the drastic change his life is about to undergo, along with his general incompetence at, well, pretty much everything, mean he could easily become an absentee president.Those reports are also alleging that Trump wants to spend a lot of time doing exactly what he did on the campaign trail: Holding huge rallies. He needs the applause. He needs the adoration. He needs to be seen and heralded and worshiped like the god he s not. Some are trying to spin this as a good thing: I think Trump has discovered that these rallies are tremendous opportunities for him to get his message out,  said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media, a conservative website.  It s actually sort of old-fashioned, that you want to actually meet people and press the flesh with him. We re sure that s the reason. What about the actual work of being president, though? That s possibly not even on his radar right now.He s already an absentee president-elect   the only contact he s had with his transition team has been through Christie. Fissures are appearing between New Yorkers who worked on the campaign and think of themselves as outsiders and Washington team-builders who ve been quietly laying the groundwork for an actual administration.The New Yorkers view those people as nothing more than pencil-pushers, while the Washington group views the New Yorkers as interlopers.There s a rift emerging between Corey Lewandowski and Reince Priebus over who s going to head the RNC. Lewandowski s allies also see Priebus, who s up for White House Chief of Staff, as the very establishment insider they supposedly don t want.Social and fiscal conservatives from places like The Heritage Foundation find themselves annoyed with Chris Christie and his allies, whom they view as not conservative enough to even be there.Then there are his kids, who are playing pivotal roles in the transition and raising eyebrows about how they re going to manage a blind trust while working directly with or even leading the transition team and administration. Their involvement with the transition is creating some serious problems: That s a fight you can t win,  one of the people said.  The Christie people are from New Jersey, they act like they re in charge, and Jared Kushner is like,  You re not really in charge.' Trump has praised some of his closest allies from the campaign, but the transition is shaping up to look like his campaign. Actually, it will be multiplied by about a billion since this team is responsible for several thousand hires and placements within the administration, and Trump can t run a bare-bones administration while still doing whatever he wants.And Trump has quietly retreated, like he always does, seemingly under the assumption that since he s the boss, he just has to stand around, look pretty, and listen to the loudly cheering crowds, and doesn t have to be around and actually do any real work.Featured image by Zach Gibson via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It s hard to trust someone who s that opaque. For applicants for his transition team and administration? They have to be transparent about it, which reveals massive double standards on Trump s part.The transition team s website, GreatAgain.gov, says: Financial holdings and sources of income must be disclosed. Any conflicts must be remedied by divestiture, the creation of special trusts, and other actions. Okay, so they can do that with financial disclosures rather than their tax returns. In fact, they ll be required to file those financial disclosures. But then there s this, which is where Trump s hypocrisy comes in: You will be asked about possible conflicts of interest deriving from your sources of income; all aspects of your personal and professional life, including organization [sic] which you belong or once belonged; speeches you may have given and books, articles and editorials you may have written; legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings to which you may have been a party; in short, anything that might embarrass the President or you if he should choose you for a position in his administration. This refers, in part, to the SF-86, which is required for anyone in order to gain a security clearance. The kicker is this: Even knowing that these job candidates have to give out sensitive and detailed information about their lives, it shows that Trump is applying a different set of standards to himself than those by which his workforce must abide.Trump gets away with being opaque to everyone and probably pats himself on the back for it, and can continue to be so while his candidates will have to be forthcoming and detailed. He can even continue to lie about things that are important to gain the public s trust. His candidates?Nope.The SF-86 is ridiculously thorough, and it s an ungodly pain in the ass to fill out because of that, even through the online e-Qip system. It asks for a lot of financial information (along with just about everything else that was ever in your life) including bankruptcies, tax liens, repossessions, judgments entered against you, and more. A lot of this is information that Trump has flatly lied about, denied, or downplayed. His candidates don t have that luxury.Information provided on the SF-86 is covered under the Privacy Act, so his candidates  info will not be made public, even through a FOIA request. Someone handling those forms and investigations would have to get stupid in order for that info to be made public.The double standard remains, though.

Some of us are in total shock, despair and disbelief, and some of us are finding creative ways to resist this presidency. First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams is amongst those raising eyebrows with an unprecedented suggestion for Americans.On Wednesday night, during a dinner hosted by the Media Law Resource Center, the top lawyer made a suggestion that shocked everyone. First, he called Trump  the greatest threat to the First Amendment since the passage of the Sedition Act of 1798.  And then he surprised everyone again when he suggested that reporters should think about suing Trump.When Abrams, who is the most well-known First Amendment lawyer in the country, was asked for clarification, he said: It s seems to be that in light of the attacks made by then-Candidate Trump against the press on a continuing basis his preventing certain journalists from even attending his rallies as part of the press corps because he disapproved for their writing, and his public comments about wanting to loosen American libel law the press ought to be thinking broadly about how to defend itself if his Administration turns out to be as antagonistic to the press as may be the case. Abrams also cited libel law, and suggested that Trump be sued by the media for defamation. Abrams warned the press that it should be trying to protect itself, as Trump has threatened several times to prevent the media from speaking negatively about him. It may well be necessary to think outside the box in response to a deliberately repressive administration. It s because the level of hostility to the press, and perhaps the willingness to limit or punish press criticism may reach a new height in this administration. Although Abrams mentioned that this would be a first for American journalists, maybe it s time that changed. The press is used to defending libel cases. That s a good part to what I ve done in my career. So as to protect free speech and free expression as much as possible. I m not seeking to move away from that. My plea is to bear in mind that one of the potential weapons is that when anyone president or shoemaker defames an entity, and speaks falsely and maliciously, one of the possible responses is to bring a libel suit. Trump has spent days on Twitter bashing the media and condemning journalists for speaking the truth about him. Even after the election, Trump has continued to criticize the media for doing its job.

And because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist.South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told WYFF-TV that Trump should pick Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the nominee and warned Democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how Republicans have treated President Obama s nominee and threatened to block any nominees Hillary Clinton would have made had she won the election. I m here to tell my Democratic colleagues that I voted for Obama s nominees. I expect them to give Trump s nominees a fair shake. He won this election. He will pick a conservative. I would put Ted Cruz on that list. If they try to block this pick, they will regret it. If you don t honor Trump s nominee, you re making a huge mistake. Democrats should stand up and give Graham a collective middle finger.Since Antonin Scalia died in February, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court bench that has yet to be filled. The body wasn t even cold yet before Republicans vowed to block any nominee President Obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny Garland a confirmation hearing. That s far from the  fair shake  Graham is asking Democrats to give to a man as dangerous as Ted Cruz.Putting Cruz on the Supreme Court would guarantee rulings against women s rights and LGBT rights as well as putting laws like the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act in further peril. In no uncertain terms should Democrats grant Cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of Trump s conservative choices for the court. Republicans should have thought about  fair shakes  before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the Supreme Court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than Trump.

He claimed to have solid evidence of that, and so did conspiracy sites that purported to be able to see what Hillary was staring at on her podium for one of the debates. It seems, though, that Trump s gripe was less-than legitimate   even more so than most of his gripes throughout the campaign.This kind of thing is only a problem if it could hurt him. When it benefits him, everyone should have at. But we knew that. What many probably didn t know is that the accusations he insisted on lobbing during the final stretch up to the disastrous Nov. 8 election were incredibly, amazingly, astonishingly, astoundingly hypocritical.Megyn Kelly s new book, Settle For More, details out a lot of what Trump did to her during the primaries. But that s not all. The New York Times  review of her book says: The day before the first presidential debate, Mr. Trump was in a lather again, Ms. Kelly writes. He called Fox executives, saying he d heard that her first question  was a very pointed question directed at him.  This disconcerted her, because it was true: It was about his history of using disparaging language about women. The day before.  Now how did he know what Kelly was going to ask, we wonder? Could it be that someone at Fox leaked the debate questions to him? There s no other way for him to know that.Throughout the last 17 months, the accusations Trump leveled at his enemies were things he himself was guilty of. Following the third general election debate, he was adamant about exposing alleged treachery on the part of the DNC and Hillary. His claim was that she d gotten the debate questions in advance, while he was kept in the dark. We have to ask Trump,  Project, much?  Then again, projection is what he does.But that s not all   Settle For More also contains this tidbit: On the day of the debate, Ms. Kelly writes, she woke up feeling great. Then an overzealous, suspiciously enthusiastic driver picked her up to take her to the convention center. He insisted on getting her coffee, though she d repeatedly declined his offer. Once it was in her hand, she drank it. And within 15 minutes, she was violently ill, vomiting so uncontrollably that it was unclear if she d be able to go on and help moderate that evening. It was so bad that she kept a trash pail beneath her desk throughout the debate, just in case. Was Trump trying to poison her in advance of the debate? She doesn t say, and The New York Times wisely leaves that up to the reader to determine. Regardless, it s suspicious and entirely typical of a man like Trump   he will stop at nothing to get revenge on his enemies. And the Electoral College will put this man in the White House.Photo of Megyn Kelly by Neilson Barnard via Getty Images for Hollywood Reporter.

Presumably, he s talking about Trump s disgustingly shocking win on Election Day. It looked a lot like Trump might actually be held accountable for his actions despite the win, but now the trial might not even take place.Curiel said: It would be wise for the plaintiffs, for the defendants, to look closely at trying to resolve this case given all else that s involved. He also said he d allow Trump to testify via video due to his new obligations in Washington. Besides that, he told Trump s lawyers that they could again request that specific campaign statements be withheld from both the jury and himself.Earlier, Addicting Info writer Wendy Gittleson reported that a lawyer believes Trump could be impeached very quickly after taking office because of these lawsuits. All three suits involve charges of fraud and racketeering. The reasoning was that there s a question of whether the legal aspects involved in these cases could  rise to the level of impeachment. If they did, it would probably be goodbye Trump since Congress wasn t too keen on him anyway.However, with Curiel advising the parties involved in the suits in his court to settle, it could actually quietly go away with Trump paying less than he might have otherwise, and it could remove a potential block to four years of Trump in the White House.Earlier this month, the woman who was suing Trump for rape dropped her case after receiving death threats. She had canceled a press conference, too, out of fear for her safety and life. This is the woman that accused Trump of raping her when she was 13, and it s very, very likely she was terrorized into dropping the suit.There s still a fraud case relating to Trump U. pending in the New York attorney general s office. Other than that, it s entirely possible that Trump will, more or less, get away with a slap on the wrist for this, depending on whether the plaintiffs agree to settle and agree to whatever Trump proposes as a settlement.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He said it was just an off the wall comment and wasn t meant to be racist. He said it was a bunch of male and female students in the hallway and he was talking to everyone. Let s be honest here. I could see if he said Donald s going to deport everyone. (Even then I would have questions) but my daughter said he pointed at the 3 black students and said Donald s going to send you back to Africa. I believe he s sorry but he s only sorry because he s in trouble. Lastly I m going to see what the school does. They can play around here if they want to. The teacher didn t think telling black students to go back to Africa was racist?! Is he just that stupid, or is racism so ingrained in his mind that he literally doesn t see where he did anything wrong?This cannot be the America we live in.

And although Republicans retained majorities in both houses of Congress, they did so extremely narrowly, and it s very likely that more people voted Democratic than Republican. Sound unfair? It is.With that in mind, it s not over. It s never over. The causes progressives fight for still need our voices, our action, and in the not-too-distant future, our votes. We need to start organizing right now, today, to undo all of the damage Republicans are going to do over the next two years. There are no other options on the table other than to fight tooth and nail at every level.Luckily, it appears that some Democratic leaders understand that. Jason Kander, a veteran and rising star in the Democratic Party, was the secretary of state in Missouri   a very red state. You may remember him as the candidate that advocated for background checks while assembling a rifle blindfolded:Kander lost by only three points in a red state that voted for Trump by 19 percent, while running against an incumbent with 20 years in Washington   Republican Senator Roy Blunt. That s huge   and if Democrats hope to regain power, they re going to need candidates like Kander that can help them stay competitive when it comes to communicating with the white working class (who just MASSIVELY voted against their own interests). That s why it s extremely heartening to see that he s FAR from giving up. In a statement on his campaign website, Jason Kander states:This is the message where I m supposed to thank you for all you ve done for me, tell you how much it meant to me, and then say my goodbyes and wish you luck on your journey. I m supposed to say something like,  Perhaps our paths will cross again. But that s not how I roll. Of course, I am thankful to you and I m forever grateful for this experience.

It could easily happen, and as much as we can t stand Trump, that would be horrible.Before you shake your head and dismiss this as just another conspiracy theory, here are some facts from a Utah law professor, Christopher Lewis Peterson, who wrote a 22 page article telling us how and why Congress can and should impeach Trump. Clearly, we won t reprint all of the 22 pages, but here s the abstract, which by itself is pretty compelling:In the final weeks of the 2016 Presidential campaign Donald J. Trump faces three lawsuits accusing him of fraud and racketeering. These ongoing cases focus on a series of wealth seminars called  Trump University  which collected over $40 million from consumers seeking to learn Trump s real estate investing strategies. Although these consumer protection cases are civil proceedings, the underlying legal elements in several counts that plaintiffs seek to prove run parallel to the legal elements of serious crimes under both state and federal law. This essay provides a legal analysis of whether Trump s alleged behavior would, if proven, rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the presidential impeachment clause of the United States Constitution. This essay begins with a summary of the evidence assembled in the three pending Trump University civil lawsuits. Next, it describes the legal claims involved in each matter. Then, this essay summarizes the applicable law of presidential impeachment under the United States Constitution and analyzes whether Trump s actions in connection with Trump University are impeachable offenses. Finally, I offer concluding thoughts, considering in particular the policy implications of a major presidential campaign with simultaneously pending legal complaints of fraud and racketeering.Now, why would a Republican Congress impeach a Republican President? Well, as you recall, the vast majority of the GOP wing of Congress only reluctantly supported Trump.Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, was perhaps the most vocal reluctant supporter, saying that he was  sickened  by Trump s rhetoric, but would support him anyway.Most thought Ryan was sticking with Trump as a matter of political expediency. After all, they share the exact same voter base, but perhaps Ryan, who s not stupid, had something up his sleeve. Trump s VP pick, Mike Pence, is tailor made to help elevate Paul Ryan s agenda. He s  ber conservative and  ber Christian. While Trump is a wildcard, Pence is someone who Ryan can Trust. Pence won t squawk while Ryan strips senior citizens of Social Security or the poor of food. Trump might not squawk, but he s not predictable, either.While both Ryan and Pence (and most Republicans in Congress) are social conservatives who want to set back rights for LGBT people and women, again, Trump is a wildcard. Trump used to be pro-choice and despite the fact that his campaign was built on hate, he said very little about LGBT people. It s highly doubtful that Trump will defend the rights of gay people or abortion rights, but that s not a chance Ryan or Republicans in Congress want to take.The Trump University lawsuit is set to start at the end of the month. It s a civil suit, but it will highlight that voters elected a con man. It will certainly be enough to make the most anti-Trump members of Congress talk and it could give us a President Pence. Yes, that s frightening.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Apparently, this jackass literally thinks racism didn t exist before 2008.He began by claiming that the reason people are protesting Donald Trump is because they were indoctrinated in the schools as kids. It starts in the elementary schools where they re just brainwashing kids,  Dan claimed.  Our history is really not our history, but they re rewriting history. The only ones rewriting history in this country are racist conservatives who want to pretend that the Civil War wasn t about slavery, that slavery was just some kind of worker exchange program, and that Moses was a founding father. Seriously.When asked what he would say to the protesters, Dan said,  Grow up. It s disrespect for the law, disrespect for authority. This is coming from a man who probably hoped conservatives would attempt a bloody coup if Hillary Clinton had won. I don t seem to remember any conservatives calling those threats  disrespect for the law.

President Obama was merely calling out the documented excessive use of force some police officers have been using against people of color. That s not racist.When Huntsman expressed doubt about Dan s accusation, he went even further by claiming that President Obama s policies are racist. But that s not true either. President Obama has taken a lot of flack for not focusing as much on specifically helping the black community, in fact. His policies, such as Obamacare, helped people of all races, including Dan, get health insurance that they couldn t previously afford.That s just reality.Here s the video via Youtube:You have to wonder who conservatives are going to blame when they no longer have President Obama to point their grubby little fingers at.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It turns out that just two days after Trump has gotten elected to be the next President of the United States, most of our instincts were correct.On Thursday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed that  there were contacts  between the Trump campaign the Russian embassy staff throughout this election. He said: Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage. Those people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions. I cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives. This news comes after we d already seen various instances where Trump embraced and praised Putin during his campaign, giving the impression that these two might actually be best friends. Trump had also said he would improve America s relations with Russia, and told NATO allies  they ll need to pay tribute to the United States if they want to continue to have protection against possible Russian aggression. Trump s relationship with Russia concerned intelligence and foreign policy experts alike   and it should concern all of us as well. Trump has lied about his relationship with Russia   much like he has lied about everything else in his presidential campaign. Trump repeatedly told Americans that he had not been interacting with the Kremlin even in the face of evidence that he was praising Putin. Once again, Ryabkov contradicted Trump s previous denial when he said: We have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes.

In theory, 20 people are supposed to parachute into the Department of Homeland Security [during the transition between administrations]. And I don t think they have anybody to do it. It s funny to see the Trump campaign struggle to fill these much needed positions, scrambling at the last minute, reaching out to any possible candidate they can to no avail. In fact a handful of U.S. officials already said they re considering leaving their jobs.This says quite a bit about our new commander-in-chief. Trump is not experienced in office at all, not to mention he is just simply unfit to run a country, especially the U.S.A.. He promised to do quite a few things during his first 100 days in office, but it looks like he s going to be busy staffing his administration before he can begin undoing all of Obama s work. Good thing too, because this country already is great, and nothing Trump has said he s going to do will make it any better. As a country, we ve come pretty far over the last several years, but with Trump promising to  ban all Muslims  and build a giant wall on the Mexican border it looks like it s been in vain.

That s enough,  Jones said before explaining how Muslim-Americans feel right now because the candidate who viciously attacked them for the last year and a half now has the reigns of power.  Now hold on a second. Muslim parents that are afraid right now aren t afraid because of these kids with these signs. They are afraid because he said over and over again he wanted to ban people of their faith. McEnany tried to use her uppity white woman status to talk over Jones, telling him that he needs to  correct the fear  to make anti-Trump forces blindly get behind Trump as if he never said anything offensive or insulting at all.But Jones would have none of it. Back off,  Jones told McEnany.  You need to have a little bit of empathy and understanding for people who are afraid because your candidate has been one of the most explosively provocative candidates in the history of our country and there is a price to be paid for that. I am not going to be talked over tonight. I m not. You have people who are terrified and you have to take some responsibility for it. Despite being smacked down, McEnany continued talking out of her ass about how Trump is the man who will unite the country and continued whining about liberals not bowing down before him.Here s the video via YouTube. The exchange between Jones and McEnany begins at the 5:00 mark.These Trump supporters are the biggest bunch of whining hypocrites in this nation, and Kayleigh McEnany is one of the biggest hypocrites and whiners of all. Time and time again through this election she has defended Trump s horrible insults, divisive remarks, and threats on CNN and now she has the gall to call for unity?Donald Trump does not deserve respect. After the way conservatives treated President Obama for eight years, it s time for them to get the same treatment. Turnabout is fair play and liberals are sick and tired of taking the high road. Conservatives certainly didn t take the high road and unite behind President Obama. They showed so much contempt for him from the beginning that they even swore allegiance to a foreign leader rather than support the president.Trump and his pathetic team should have thought about unity the day BEFORE Trump came down that fucking escalator and announced his candidacy by calling Mexicans rapists and criminals who should be rounded up and deported. Because words like those only divided and he did that repeatedly throughout his campaign. Republicans certainly should have thought about unity eight years ago when they had the chance. This call for unity by Trump is laughable and Democrats should do whatever it takes to sabotage this orange asshole s presidency for the next four years. They don t get to sabotage President Obama for eight years without consequences. Trump has said that his favorite verse in the Bible is  eye for an eye.  Liberals and Democrats should demonstrate it for him with the same contempt Republicans showed for President Obama over all these years.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It s early right now, but sources have told Politico who is in line for some top positions. If you weren t already panicking just from his win last night, now would be a good time to start.Perhaps most alarming are his potential picks for Secretary of DHS. Politico reports that Sheriff David Clarke is said to be a major contender. This is the Milwaukee sheriff who made a name for himself calling for  pitchforks and torches  and armed rebellion if Trump lost.But he seems to be the main contender, not the sole contender. There s also a possibility that Bridgegate Kingpin Chris Christie could be in line for the position, as could Rudy Giuliani. Putting either of these people in charge of agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and more, could potentially be very damaging.For Secretary of State, we have John Bolton, former U.N. ambassador and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Bolton was a controversial figure at the U.N., and he championed George W. Bush s insistence on one-sided foreign policy. Fan-bloody-tastic.Newt Gingrich could also be in line for this position, as could Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee.Trump is rumored to want to put his own finance chief, who s a former Goldman-Sachs exec, in as Secretary of the Treasury. Besides the blatant cronyism, a Wall Street executive in a cabinet position goes against everything Trump claimed about Hillary and her ties to the banks.Rudy Giuliani is rumored to be considered for a host of positions, including Attorney General, White House Chief of Staff, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence/CIA Director. Giuliani is about as erratic and unreasonable as Trump   the most benign position in this list is probably Chief of Staff.Chris Christie may also be up for Attorney General.Trump s top pick for Secretary of Energy is Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm. This guy has shaped a lot of Trump s ideas on energy policy, which includes gutting renewable energy and escalating fossil fuel use.For Secretary of the Interior, the leading candidate right now is Forrest Lucas, the founder of Lucas Oil. An oil executive and a vocal animal rights opponent is such a great pick to protect our lands and our wildlife. We can probably say goodbye to national parks, the endangered species list, and more if he s chosen.Other candidates include none other than Queen Drunken Airhead herself, Sarah Palin, as well as Trump s own son, Donald Trump Jr. No nepotism there at all.Trump wants a business leader, a.k.a. a CEO, for Labor Secretary. Interestingly enough, though, the current commissioner of the EEOC, Victoria Lipnic, is said to be a frontrunner for this job. She s one of Obama s picks and supports things like the Equal Pay Act. She wants to get rid of the EEOC s pay data collection system, though.Trump said early on that he wanted to eliminate the EPA, but has since modified that position. However, he wants to put noted climate skeptic Myron Ebell in charge of the agency responsible for ensuring we have clean air and clean water, so he might as well eliminate it.Ben Carson.  Nuff said.Politico has their full list, and CNN also has a list. It s very early yet, and it s true that not every single person Trump is considering would be a bad choice. For instance, he wants someone who s already got a lot of experience with Veterans  Affairs to head up the VA.

Goldberg wondered  whether we are a nation who believes in people s rights as they are Constitutionally guaranteed. Behar responded with a brutal truthbomb, making reference to the fact that even in the year 2016, sexism allows less qualified men (or in this case, completely UNqualified men) to come out ahead of women who are over-qualified. Behar said: You know what I learned. I learned that, as usual men can get away with anything and women can get away with nothing. That s what I learned.

Because Republicans controlled most state legislatures during the time of the last census, Republican votes tend to count more than Democratic votes do.That s why, despite the simple fact that more people probably voted for Hillary Clinton, we are facing at least four years of a Donald Trump presidency. We actually saw exactly how this would play out in 2012, when Republicans took the House despite losing by over a million in the popular vote. Democrats simply can t afford close races.It s hard to admit, but Donald Trump was right about something   the election WAS rigged. By state and congressional Republicans, and then by obstructionists. Hopefully, this loss teaches the Democrats that stayed home and leftists that refused to unify that we can t afford to put ideology over pragmatism. When the other side is cheating, the only solution is to boost turnout beyond what they can cope with. That s really the only way to see a silver lining in any of this   maybe people will learn. The Democratic Party picked up seats in the House and Senate   enough to give the GOP a taste of  no    but the next four years are looking bleak.Here s a video that explains the process of gerrymandering and how Republicans have orchestrated it so that your vote doesn t count the way it should:Also, you should know there is an interstate compact between quite a few states   and the list is growing   that are pledging to give their electors to the winner of the popular vote the next time around. That d be a win for democracy. If we d had that in play this time around, we might not be looking at a Donald Trump presidency.

The difference is for Jay-Z to shout these expletives on a stage at a political rally while the Democrats are trying to stand on a moral high ground saying we re better than that and Hillary Clinton is putting out commercials with little girls looking in the mirror,  she said.But Cooper was ready for that and promptly humiliated her by pointing out something that a conservative musician did at a recent Trump rally. Ted Nugent grabbed his package at his concert, didn t he?  Cooper asked as McEnany sat in stunned silence for a couple seconds.Here s the video via VidMe.Trump supporters will literally say anything to criticize Hillary Clinton.

Maybe.Last night s tweet about it was probably one of the most egregious of ideas for how to ensure that we crown King Trump:If only people with at least 4 grandparents born in America were voting, Trump would win in a 50-state landslide.  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) November 8, 2016HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! The funny thing is that if we went by that standard, Trump s own kids couldn t vote for him. Trump himself couldn t even vote   all his grandparents came from Europe, as did his mother, which excludes Tiffany. So even his grandkids, if they were of age, couldn t vote for him.And then there s Melania, who worked in this country illegally. For all we know, she stole a modeling job from an American model who badly needed the work. Going by Coulter s logic, she shouldn t be allowed to cast a vote for her husband. But then again, Trump s logic about immigrants would send Melania back to Slovenia, since there s a chance she stole a job from a hardworking American.Then there are all the people with four grandparents that were born here who still think Trump is a racist prick and would never vote for him. My family history here goes all the way back to before we were even a country. In fact, my family was here almost 150 years before the Declaration of Independence was signed. Plenty of others like me feel the same, but of course a racist like Coulter didn t think of that.Actually, it s very likely that all she thought of was eliminating the Latino vote, because many Latinos are first- or second-generation, and tend to vote Democratic. She didn t think of all the members of  her kind  who are likewise first- and second-generation, who couldn t vote at all if her idea became law.And what of her own family history? She considers herself, and her family,  settlers  rather than  immigrants  (they were immigrants). She would qualify to vote under her idea, so of course most other white conservatives would. She didn t think this through at all. Or maybe she did, but she s so ignorant about the makeup of this country that she has no idea what she just said.

However, when conservative host Charlie Sykes asked if the GOP was now Trump s party, Ryan made it as clear as he could that no, the Republican party does not belong to Donald Trump.

As a party leader, as the highest elected official in the party, I have always felt a duty to the process, to democracy, to the primary voter who must be respected.

What a ringing endorsement to give on the eve of the election. (Insert sarcasm here.)Ryan was slow to endorse Trump and has repeatedly condemned the bombastic billionaire s offensive actions. Ryan denounced the Muslim ban as unconstitutional and declared Trump s attacks on the Mexican-American judge presiding over a Trump University lawsuit as the  textbook definition  of racism.

In doing so, he terrified them into actually discussing a confrontation with the network, accusing them of bias and intent to suppress the vote of Trump fans.He s always thought his rally numbers proved he was winning, but now he pushes that almost to the exclusion of all else as his real numbers fall. And his rallies are indicative of nothing, but they re all he s got left and somewhere he knows it.In fact, that could be why he scheduled five rallies across half the country for one day, three of which were in Minnesota, Virginia and Michigan. He has a less than one-in-five chance of winning those states. He s only got a one-in-four chance of winning Pennsylvania now. Some on Twitter were confused by where he staged his rally blitz:wait.

Sickeningly, it seems to have worked.And they re bragging about it in a press release. Openly. Loudly. Proudly. Gleefully. The title reads,  NCGOP Sees Encouraging Early Voting, Obama/Clinton Coalition Tired, Fail to Resonate in North Carolina. That would all well and good if it were actually true.

In response to that, Governor Pat McCrory threw a tantrum, and the state went about finding other ways of suppressing voters.The party s solution to the Supreme Court s ruling was to pressure individual county boards to limit early voting, especially Sunday voting, and many did despite the fact that the black community overwhelmingly votes early, and often on Sunday after church. The state s elections board mitigated some of these restrictions, but not all, and the black and student communities were still disproportionately harmed.Other states in the South have shown increases of black voters during early voting as much as 18 percent in one case but North Carolina saw a sharp decline:Something went very wrong for African-Americans  voting in North Carolina pic.twitter.com/ZpwjyEavmd  Michael McDonald (@ElectProject) November 6, 2016What s happened is that Republicans knew they d lose the state if minority voters were able to vote more easily because they tend to vote Democratic.

Bush won by a mere 537 votes. As a Florida resident, Navarro doesn t want a repeat that send Trump to the White House.So she cast her vote for Hillary and told the world all about it in a column published on CNN.I had hoped that a week before the election, Trump would be losing Florida by a large enough margin that my vote wouldn t matter. But darn it, my home state is too close to call. Florida could be the decisive state (again) as to who ultimately becomes the next president of the United States. I thought back to the 2000 election, which was decided by 537 votes in Florida. I thought about how I would feel if the same thing happened in 2016. I thought and I thought and I thought .Then I cast my vote for Hillary Clinton. Let me rephrase that. I cast my vote against Donald Trump. I did it without joy or enthusiasm. I did it out of civic duty and love for our country.Navarro, who is an immigrant, said she voted against Trump because of the way he has insulted and demonized immigrants like her over the past year and half. On the first day of his campaign, Trump called Mexicans  rapists  and as a Hispanic immigrant that infuriated Navarro. I voted against Donald Trump for every American who looks and sounds like me,  Navarro wrote.  Because we love this country. We are proud of this country. We stand as equals in the United States of America. Trump has also repeatedly insulted women, and as a woman herself, that disgusted Navarro to her core. I voted against Donald Trump because of all women in my life who have been sexually harassed or assaulted and remained silent, bearing the embarrassment, even shame, for years,  she continued.And Trump has also insulted disabled Americans, which made this election gave Navarro a more personal reason to vote against Trump.I voted against Trump because of Daniel Navarro, my severely disabled brother. My entire life, I have been pained and angered seeing young kids stare at him and mimic his disability. I had never seen a grown man mimic a disabled person. Trump did so in front of thousands of people at one of his rallies. In front of millions of people watching on TV. Most of us would punish our children for exhibiting such behavior.For Navarro it came down to choosing a candidate who has bad character or a candidate who made some bad judgments. In the end, Navarro voted for the latter because she believes a president needs to be a role model for children and while bad judgments can be avoided in the future, bad character won t change.She slammed Trump for being a terrible role model and blasted him for calling our democratic system rigged just because he is losing. And that s why she urged everyone to use their vote as a weapon to defeat Trump. Some tell me, in 2016 we should no longer expect the president of the United States to be a role model,  Navarro wrote.  I refuse to accept that. The president of the United States has to lift us all in moments of national grief. The president of the United States has to hug the children and spouses of fallen soldiers. That person represents us all. That person is recognized as the face and the voice for America in front of the rest of the world, and more importantly, by our children. A person supported by the Klu Klux Klan and its former Grand Wizard David Duke can never represent me. He can never be a role model for me.We each have a right and a duty to make a personal choice based on those things that are most important to us, that we value most. My conscience compels me to do every little thing I can to make sure a bad person is not our next president. In America, we don t choose our leaders through violence or armed insurrections.One vote is our right. One vote is our weapon. I am exercising mine against Donald Trump.Donald Trump is so toxic that many Republicans like Navarro have jumped ship to endorse or vote for Hillary Clinton. So much so that some red states such as Texas, Arizona, and Georgia are in play for the Democrats this year and may end up becoming battleground states in elections to come.

Completely missing the irony in what he would say next, Trump warned: The investigations into her crimes will go on for a long, long time. Trump was obviously projecting onto Clinton, because he currently has thousands of lawsuits against him, not including the high-profile sexual assault cases that have recently come to light after his lewd comments on an audio tape were uncovered, or the fact that he hasn t paid his taxes in decades. If anyone should be worried about being guilty of wrongdoing, it s definitely Trump   and it s something we should keep in mind on Election Day tomorrow.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And then Trump did the opposite when Comey announced the discovery of some more emails. Now Donald Trump is once again attacking Comey.During an interview on CNN, Anderson Cooper asked Conway to explain why Trump is still saying that Hillary is going to be indicted when the facts don t support him. Wasn t it irresponsible of him at that point to be saying such things without having any facts, particularly now that Comey has come forward and said there was nothing there?  Cooper asked.Conway then launched into complaints that Hillary s campaign attacked Comey, only to be reminded by Cooper that Trump s campaign has done the same thing every time they didn t get the result they wanted.Cooper asked his original question again, and Conway still refused to answer by attacking Clinton. Conway also reasoned that it s okay for Trump to speculate without facts because some people on CNN have done so. But Cooper told Conway that  just because people jump off a bridge doesn t mean you should.  Conway finally was forced to say that she doesn t think Trump is being irresponsible.Conway then whined about Hillary going negative against Trump, which forced Cooper to remind her that Trump has been going negative throughout his campaign.Then Conway swerved again and focused on the Clinton Foundation. But once again, Cooper foiled her talking points by noting that we know more about the Clinton Foundation than we know about Trump s tax returns, because unlike Trump, Hillary released documents. Isn t it a little hypocritical to be using information that you know about the foundation because they actually have released all of their financial records when your candidate hasn t done any of that?  Cooper asked.Of course, Conway denied the blatant hypocrisy and quizzed Cooper to answer how Trump made his money. Cooper zinged back by saying people build buildings and Trump slaps his name on them for licensing fees, which made Conway cry foul.Conway then returned to whining about Hillary s campaign attacking Comey after praising him in July. But again, Cooper hit Conway with the fact that Trump has also gone back and forth attacking and praising Comey.And then Conway claimed that Hillary had her maid print out information. Cooper flattened that claim by pointing out that it was a story by the New York Post that hasn t been confirmed.Finally, Conway claimed that Hillary is desperate by hanging out with performers like Beyonce and Jay-Z, but claimed that people are only going to those rallies to see the celebrity singers. But when Cooper pointed out that Ted Nugent is appearing with Trump at rallies Conway insisted that people are going to those rallies to see Donald Trump.Here s the video via YouTube.Over and over again, Kellyanne Conway flat out committed hypocrisy and got called out for it by Cooper. How she can actually look herself in the mirror every morning knowing that she is lying and being a hypocrite every day is a mystery. But when this election is over, Conway should never be allowed to work again in politics or in the media. And Donald Trump certainly should not be allowed to become president.Featured Image: Screenshot ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Assuming Hillary Clinton wins Tuesday s election, as she s predicted to do, she will owe at least part of her success to the Senate Minority Leader and Senior Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid.Nevada, which is a traditional red state, is a tossup this year. FiveThirtyEight shows both Donald Trump and Clinton in a statistical near tie, but early voting trends seem to be putting the race firmly in Clinton s camp. This is especially good news for Clinton because if she wins Nevada s six electoral votes, it will mean that she can still afford to lose Florida and North Carolina. Trump won t (and doesn t) have that luxury. If Clinton does win, that will be Reid s doing:Yet about one thing Trump was right: Harry Reid built this. After two years of boosting voter registration among key Democratic demographics, the retiring Senate minority leader has brought turnout among Hispanics in the state to record levels. In doing so, he s almost surely delivered the state for Hillary Clinton and possibly with it the presidential race (Trump has only the narrowest path to 270 electoral votes without Nevada). The reality of this election is that if Clinton wins, especially if she ends up needing Nevada, it s not a stretch to declare that Reid was the single most important person in her victory.Source: PoliticoTrump is complaining about the turnout of Latino voters, but he has no one to blame but himself. His campaign began by attacking Mexican immigrants and calling them  rapists  and  drug dealers,  and it expanded into an all out attack on immigrants. Then, there was the judge he said couldn t be partial since he was  Mexican.  The judge isn t. He s Mexican-American. Or, there are Trump s attacks on Univision s Jorge Ramos. The list could go on, but it s cost Trump big. Clinton has the support of 3/4 of Latinos and Trump has the lowest approval rating among Latinos than anyone in more than 30 years.Reid s ground operation exploited the fear and loathing of Trump to the max, and the early results bear it out: Whereas the Latino vote was 15 percent of the Nevada electorate in 2008 and 18 percent in 2012, data I have seen shows now it is up 30 percent from 2012 in early voting, meaning it could go above 20 percent of all voters by Tuesday evening. We ve been focused on registering and building our Latino turnout from Day 1,  said one Democratic organizer.  That is paying dividends with Latino turnout up in the early vote and potentially up overall. In five out of the six highest Hispanic precincts, turnout in the early vote exceeded  12. Right now, Nevada appears almost un-winnable for Trump. If he loses, that will pretty much seal his fate. As for Reid, well, he will no longer be in office and the Senate race in Nevada is a squeaker, but it s hard to imagine that if Hillary walks away with the state in her pocket, so will Cortez Masto, the Democratic poised to replace Reid.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.

When President Obama heard about it, he had no choice but to mock Trump. Apparently his campaign has taken away his Twitter,  Obama said during a Florida rally for Hillary Clinton, to laughs.

Nevertheless, Trump is among the first who tried to paint him as such by asking how much Hillary had paid him to protest at his rally.

Nobody could ever possibly show up on the joke that is Wikileaks if they re not connected to Hillary in some way, right? Right. Ha.    Crites  name apparently does show up on Wikileaks, but even this right-wing site says they re not in connection with any of Podesta s emails. Rather, he shows up in connection with a company called Stratfor, which is a global intelligence agency The Atlantic characterizes as  just The Economist a week later and several hundred times more expensive. Yet Wikileaks claims that Stratfor is a front for a global network of shadowy informants and spies, and even publishes its  payment laundering scheme  for those people. The truth is that Stratfor is, more or less, a joke among analysts and others who actually know what s going on in the world, and their methods of information gathering are no different than journalistic methods.In other words, in reporting this, Wikileaks appears desperate to The Atlantic, and the people screaming  SMOKING HILLARY GUN!!  because Crites  name appears in a few Wikileaks dumps are just as pitifully desperate.They don t care, though.

Now, the Toronto Star s Daniel Dale has been tracking Trump s lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here.There are literally hundreds of lies in Trump s speeches. They re not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy.Is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, she s actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form.The Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clinton s policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clinton s record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintons  corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trump s endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obama s record, The campaign, Russia, Trump s record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clinton s health and Government corruption.They also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with,  The electoral system is rigged.  Of course, it s rigged against him: After plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election.  Rigged  became his catchword.He claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired  thugs  to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis   cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats.In Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they don t trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice. Nobody s committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans.Another is,  Muslims are risky.  This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: His claims that Syrian refugees   99 per cent are Muslim   are terrorists plays to the fears of the  other,  even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trump s claims   about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016. The polls favour Trump.  Har de har har   Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and they re usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: It seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This  poll denialism  gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN.His false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling   and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible.On Oct. 24, he said  I won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.  In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost.Of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote   and exaggerate   those numbers.

Nobody found any guns at the scene, though, and the man, Austyn Crites, was allegedly put in a chokehold and grabbed by his testicles.Both Trump s social media director and his son found a tweet from a rabidly lying Trump fan saying that Trump had just survived an assassination attempt.

They still don t qualify as weapons, tthough, and oddly enough, there was no weapon and likely no aggression on the part of Crites. There are some on Twitter claiming that Crites first tried to grab a gun off of a Secret Service agent, the Secret Service merely searched him, questioned him, and released him.Doesn t sound like he tried to grab a gun there. In fact, the Secret Service has so far said nothing about that happening. Don t confuse the Trumpkins with facts and truth, though. It hurts their three brain cells.Later on, at a rally in Colorado, the man who introduced Trump to the crowd said that there was  an attempt of murder  at the Reno rally. Again, there wasn t an assassination attempt, but of course they ll say anything to garner sympathy for their candidate and make him out to be both a hero and a victim at the same time.Despite the lack of evidence that Crites was a would-be assassin, Trumpkins have taken to Twitter to push that whopper and make utter fools of themselves:    For his part, Trump issued a blah statement, and, at the time of this posting, hadn t said anything on Twitter about it.

It s being reported that certain key Democratic polling locations in Clark County were kept open for hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring Democratic voters in,  Trump said. Folks, it s a rigged system. It s a rigged system. And we re going to beat it,  he said.Trump wasn t alone.

Early indicators show that Republicans are in big trouble in the key swing state of Nevada. Clark County, home to Las Vegas and the state s largest population, is also over 30% Latino. The area has been targeted by the Clinton campaign for early voting, as well as by the political operation of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV).A strong performance there has led to a situation where the Trump ticket is behind the eight ball before Election Day has even begun. Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston has already said that there is only a tiny sliver of hope for Trump, which may explain his bluster and frustration at the campaign event.Trump launched his campaign with an attack on Latinos, calling Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists and promising to build a wall along the southern border to keep Latinos out.

I never use emails,  Trump says in the cold opener.  I use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it It s called Twitter.

Everyone has crawled into their corners, and in this most bizarre and contentious year, we re all ready to end it already. People have lost friends, relationships have ended the tone of this campaign has been good for no one. That is all due to one man s toxic rise to the top of the GOP presidential ticket: Donald Trump.There s one thing that we all need to remember, though: This was no accident. Trump is a classic demagogue. He has brought out the worst in the entire country, has appealed to people s deepest, basest levels of prejudice, hate, and fear. He s made those of us who are minorities feel especially vulnerable, because we know what is really at stake here. Well, comedian Bill Maher has a very important message regarding all of this   and especially the rise of Donald Trump   no matter which side of the political aisle you fall on.Maher, like most liberals, has spent years excoriating the GOP for their bigotry, lack of belief in science, religious fanaticism, war- mongering, and fantasy economic proposals. However, he says he was wrong. Men like Mitt Romney and John McCain were nowhere near as dangerous as Trump. To that end, he had this to say the the nation on Friday night s edition of his HBO program Real Time: So I ve heard these young people on the news they say things like Donald Trump I don t like him but Hillary, I can t vote for a liar. First of all, it s just apples, and oranges   and orange. After those opening lines, Maher got uncharacteristically grave and serious, saying: This is different. I promise it, this will not make your life better. And also, once fascists get power, they don t give it up. You ve got President Trump for life. I know liberals made a big mistake because we attacked your boy [George W.] Bush like he was the end of the world, and he wasn t. And Mitt Romney we attacked that way. I gave Obama a million dollars because I was so afraid of Mitt Romney. Maher then went on to offer olive branches to Republicans, while giving a warning about Trump: They were honorable men who we disagreed with and we should have kept it that way. So we cried wolf and that was wrong. But this is real. This is going to be way different. Bill Maher is right. Donald Trump is a dangerous demagogue. He s a literal fascist who has shown that he cares not about the Constitution, civil liberties, or any of the things we  have come to take for granted as Americans. Trump is Hitler-level dangerous. Just like they treated the last Fuhrer as a clown and a buffoon prior to his rise, just as establishment types thought they could control him and use him as a puppet to get him elected   so is the same with Trump. Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.America   don t make Germany s mistakes. This man is not who you think he is. I promise, we ll all live to regret it if we elect him.Watch Bill Maher s all too correct warning below:[ad3media campaign= 1311 ]Featured image via video screen capture ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Pat Toomey may have done the right thing on one vote, but courage is telling Pennsylvania voters where you stand on the tough issues, not just the easy ones like background checks,  Obama said in a statement Saturday afternoon.

Seriously.-Complimented North Korea s dictator, Kim Jong-un:  You ve gotta give him credit.   He goes in. He takes over. He s the boss. It s incredible. -Faced over 3,500 lawsuits, largely from ordinary Americans and small business owners who he refused to pay in spite of promises to the contrary.-Said, in 2006, that he was rooting for the real estate market to collapse, because  people like me would go in and buy  and  you can make a lot of money. -Said veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress are not  strong  and  can t handle  war.And these are just the tip of the iceberg. To read the entire list, click here.As demonstrated perfectly by Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump should have been disqualified from running for president on the first day of his campaign. He is offensive. He is hateful. He is sexist. He is a racist. And he is a liar who is more interested in helping himself than he is in helping the American people.If he somehow wins this election it will be the most disastrous election this country has ever produced and it will be an embarrassment that ruins our reputation and image around the globe.Hillary is right to point out that in any other election year any of these remarks would end a candidate s campaign. But Donald Trump has conned his deplorables into supporting him no matter what he says or does. As the number one thing on this list noted, Trump has said he  could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and   wouldn t lose any voters. One wonders what they ll let him get away with if he gets to be in the White House.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Before leaving this election behind, we must all thank Donald Trump for the one good thing he did,  Maher began.  He exposed evangelicals, who are big Trump supporters, as the shameless hypocrites they ve always been. Republicans didn t get to play the Jesus card this time around,  Maher continued.  Because it s hard to bring up the Ten Commandments when your candidate spent his life breaking all of them. Trump s commandments are like the regular commandments with LOL at the end. Maher expressed how good it felt not having religion shoved down our throats throughout this election season as in other elections in the past. And he wondered how so-called  values voters  can still support Trump, a man who literally has committed adultery on several occasions, brags about sexually assaulting women, and lies in every sentence he utters. And as Maher explained, Trump definitely has nothing in common with Jesus. Trump has nothing in common with Jesus, who was from the Middle East. Trump wouldn t even let him in the country. Jesus healed the blind, Trump mocks the handicapped. Jesus turned the other cheek, Trump grabs your pussy. Jesus turned water into wine, Trump just whines. The Bible says,  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s wife.  Trump says,  Fine, what about my daughter? Maher pointed out that evangelicals had a full bench of religious nut jobs to choose from during the primaries, including Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, and Ted Cruz.

Go figure, the cops are perfectly okay with that.Erika Cotti says she came across him while she was trying to vote at the county registrar s office. I had my 9-year-old son with me. I felt intimidated,  Cotti said.  And I had to explain to my 9-year-old why a man with a 357 magnum is standing outside the polling station. The man then tried to get her to take a sample of the Republican ballot, but she refused it. He s like,  Who are you going to vote for, crooked Hillary?  And I was like, that s really none of your business,  Cotti said.According to Loudoun County registrar Judy Brown, there was indeed a man strutting around with a gun strapped to his hip who was handing out GOP propaganda in front of her office. However, police said that since Virginia is an open carry state, it is perfectly legal for him to do so. There is a gentleman standing outside the office with a holstered gun,  Brown said.  According to law enforcement, because Virginia is open carry, he s allowed to have it. Brown said that even though the man was obviously packing heat, he was being nice  to people and didn t violate the 40-foot no-canvassing zone in front of the entrance to the building.  They said that there s nothing they could do, that he was well within his rights to be carrying his weapon,  Brown said.Brown decided to get in touch with the state Republican Party. Their answer was to get the guy to pull his Trump shirt over the gun on his side so that it wasn t clearly visible. Out of sight, out of mind, right? Hopefully nobody else will be concerned about him,  Brown said.Loudoun County Republican Committee Chairman Will Estrada said that the man has military and law enforcement experience, as well as a concealed carry permit.  We don t want to startle anyone,  Estrada said he told him.  He felt really bad, he pulled his T-shirt over it, and I think everything was fine after that. Estrada also said that he does not support the idea of banning volunteers from carrying firearms. It s a free country,  Estrada said.  I m a NRA life member myself. So long as no laws are being broken, I m not going to tell someone they can t. But I ve told all of our volunteers that we re here for our candidates, we don t want us to become the story. Cotti, who has been involved in political activism, said she gets that Virginia is an open-carry state but still doesn t think it should be acceptable to have random people blocking the entrances to polling places with guns.

However, she canceled the press conference because she had been getting death threats, and was too terrified to show up.On Wednesday, Lisa Bloom, the lawyer who organized the press conference that Ms. Doe canceled, said: Jane Doe has received numerous threats today, as have all the Trump accusers that I have represented.She is living in fear. She has decided that she is too afraid to show her face. She s been here all day ready to do it. But unfortunately she is in terrible fear. So it s entirely possible that Trump, his people, his supporters, and/or other misogynists literally terrorized her into dropping the suit. Her fears would be well-founded, too, given that Trump allegedly threatened her if she told anyone how he d violated her. One witness said: I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn t ever say anything if she didn t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed. That adds some credence to the possibility that she dropped the suit out of fear. She very likely stayed silent all this time because she was terrified of what would happen to her should she come forward. Now she s receiving death threats, which must seem to her like her worst fears coming true. It s horrific.On Friday, Jeffrey Meagher, Ms. Doe s lead attorney, simply filed a one-page notice dismissing the case without explanation. It merely reads: Pursuant to F.R.C.P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Plaintiff, by and through her counsel, hereby gives notice that the above-captioned action is voluntarily dismissed against the Defendants. She may or may not be able to file this claim again, and her attorneys would have explained that to her. However, if she s being terrorized the way it sounds and that s entirely plausible given the really despicable natures of Trump and everyone close to him she may just want to let it rest and hope to live out the rest of her life in relative peace. That does not make her a liar, though, as many will no doubt say.

Martin, who is best known as the writer of  Game of Thrones,  knows a little something about liars and bad leaders. He s written more than his share. He also knows that Trump would be one of them. In fact, in an OpEd in LiveJournal, entitled  A Simple Observation,  Martin pretty much gave Trump the blogging equivalent of one of Game of Thrones  bloodiest shows. Okay, perhaps that s an exaggeration, but he wasn t kind to Trump.Martin lives in New Mexico. He s concerned because the state, which has been pretty safely blue in recent history, is now in play (although FiveThirtyEight puts New Mexico s five electoral votes pretty firmly in Hillary s camp). Because of that, Martin has had a chance to see a lot of political ads from the presidential candidates. Despite the media s insistence that both candidates are somehow equally flawed, Martin sees big differences, even just in their ads. He sees one big difference   and this is coming from someone who makes at least part of his living in producing videos.First, he talked about the Trump commercials, which are very negative and frankly, pretty standard fare, with the exception of Trump s vulgar and ugly language:The Trump commercials are all fairly standard political attack ads. You ve seen a thousand like them. Find some bad pictures of the opponent, in this case Hillary, pictures that make them look ugly or angry or crazed (easily done, there are thousands of unflattering pictures of any public figure floating around these days). If they are not bad enough, put them up in black & white, which always seems to make them worse. Juxtapose them with negative imagery, maybe some out of context headlines. Use a faceless narrator s voice over the pictures telling us that the candidate is corrupt or a liar or  too extreme.  The latest Trump ad manages to add Anthony Weiner, who is called  Pervert Anthony Weiner.  The blatant name-calling   flinging around words like  pervert  and  crooked    is not something we have often seen before in American politics, unless you go back to the 18th and 19th centuries; that s Trump s own original ugly contribution to lowering the tenor of political discourse. The rest, however, is Attack Ad 101.Martin goes on to call Trump s ads mostly  assertion, innuendo, and name-calling,  but with no substance.Here s on sample:Now on to Clinton, and this says something pretty amazing about her in general. Her ads are honest.Clinton s ads are something else. Very different, and   to my mind   much more truthful. The star of all the Clinton ads in Donald J. Trump. There are no deliberately unflattering photographs, however. Nothing in black and white. Just video clips, full color, professional footage from news cameras at his rallies, interviews, television appearances. There s no name-calling either. Clinton doesn t need to label Trump as  crooked  or  a liar  or link him with  perverts.  Clinton s ads just show Trump being Trump.So what we have here is not Smith claiming that Jones said terrible things. What we have is actual footage of Jones saying and doing those things. No one has to accuse Trump of anything, he has laid it all out there in public for the world to see.Here s an example:G-d knows there s enough footage out there. Martin mentioned Trump mocking a disabled reporter. He mentioned the  pussy grabbing  video. Really, it goes on and on because nearly every time Trump opens his mouth, something controversial and offensive comes out.Martin goes on to talk specifically about the candidates, and his opinion of Trump is anything but favorable.He didn t say much about Hillary, but he did say this:You don t need to like Hillary. You don t need to listen to what Hillary says about Trump, or what I say about Trump. You just need to listen to Trump. If you can do that, and still consider voting for him  well Oooh oooh, I can finish that sentence. If you can listen to Trump and still consider voting for him well you don t really give a crap about the future of the country. Well, perhaps Martin had something more eloquent in mind.Featured image via Kevin Winter/Getty Images. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

No, I ve spoken to no current FBI agents,  Giuliani claimed when asked by Blitzer.  Gosh, in the last eight months, nine months, ten months, certainly not about this. Then Giuliani claimed that everything he has been hearing is just hearsay. But that apparently has not stopped him from spewing the  hearsay  on Fox News and elsewhere in an effort to smear Hillary Clinton. So, I ve had lots of conversations with them and they have told me a lot about the   I guess the disagreement between the Justice Department on the one hand and the FBI on the other. But it all comes from former FBI agents and it s all hearsay. But that s hard to believe since Giuliani claimed that he knew about Comey s letter two days in advance and that letter was actually released. It was not hearsay.Blitzer then hit Giuliani with a statement written by Democratic congressmen accusing him of obtaining leaked information from FBI agents.The statement reads: This morning Rudy Giuliani, one of Donald Trump s closest and most vocal campaign advisers, appeared on national television and confirmed that he had obtained leaked information about the FBI s review of Clinton-related e-mails several days before FBI Director James Comey sent his letter to Congress last Friday about this letter. In fact, Mr. Giuliani went even further and bragged about the information that he had obtained stating,  Did I hear about it? You re darn right I heard about it. Again, the only way Giuliani could have heard about this is if a current FBI agent leaked the information to him or passed it to him through someone else. Either way, the FBI has a serious breach that is being used to help Donald Trump. That s not correct,  Giuliani responded.  I ve had no conversations with anyone inside the FBI. I have heard for the last four months a tremendous amount of information about the consternation within the FBI, the fact that FBI agents were very unhappy about the way they were being treated by the Justice Department. But none of it came from any current   I haven t talked to a current FBI agent. So Giuliani just admitted that he is getting this information from former agents who are getting the information from current agents.Blitzer actually got Giuliani to claim that he didn t know that Comey was going to release the information he did, and that it came as a surprise, but Giuliani did an about-face only seconds later and said it wasn t a surprise. Seriously, Blitzer did a great job of getting Giuliani to tie himself in knots.The former NYC mayor then repeated his alleged  hearsay  once again by claiming that he has heard from his sources that FBI agents are angry at the Justice Department for not indicting Hillary Clinton, despite the fact that Director Comey recommended that charges were not warranted.Giuliani then claimed that he read articles about it somewhere, but didn t specify where the articles came from and said he s not sure if they are true.So Giuliani claims that he is talking to former FBI agents, and that what he has heard is merely hearsay that he spreads anyway as if it s the truth, and then he claims that he read this information in articles even though he doesn t know if what he is reading is the truth, and he still repeats it to anyone within earshot.And Wolf Blitzer drove a stake through the heart of Giuliani s bullshit by asking one question. But let me ask you a question, Mayor. If you don t know it s true, why are you suggesting it? Why are you going on national television talking about these issues if you don t know it s true? Giuliani once again touted his FBI sources, only to then be informed by Blitzer that FBI agents sign a form agreeing to never reveal information about investigations and that they have a responsibility to not leak information to people like Giuliani.Here s the video via YouTube.[ad3media campaign= 1302 ]The FBI should be thoroughly investigated by the Justice Department to find out who is leaking information to a private citizen who also happens to be a surrogate for a presidential candidate who will do anything to smear his opponent in an effort to win the election. This is a major breach within the FBI and it definitely looks like the FBI is working with Republicans to persecute Hillary Clinton. People need to be fired for this and the first person to lose their job should be Director Comey.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect  deportation forces  to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one.According to the Associated Press, it turns out that Donald Trump s wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor s visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006.So, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: As a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American. Well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasn t as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management   a modeling agency. Also, there s the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitor s visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melania s wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press.The long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the  other.  Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didn t completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Throughout the decades, Donald Trump skin pallor has turned from the normal white guy shade of beige to a color which is best represented by a pumpkin.Now, the rings around his eyes pretty much prove that Trump either spends time in tanning beds or he is a fan of fake spray tans, either of which would involve tiny goggles. Well, according to a Mother Jones expose, it could be either, but that s not the news. The news is why Trump seems to be such a fan of fake tans and it gives you a glimpse into the type of cronyism we could expect if Trump were to become president.Trump is good friends with an Indiana businessman named Steve Hilbert. In 2006, Hilbert became the CEO of New Sunshine, a company that makes tanning beds, spray tanning booths, tanning lotions, and bronzers.Trump and Hilbert have a lot in common. They are the same age. They are both rich. They both change wives about as often as Trump supporters change underwear (sorry) and they both have hideous, garish taste in decorating. Hilbert, when he was an insurance CEO, was one of the country s highest paid and he even helicoptered to work   a whole two miles.The businessman reportedly met his sixth and current wife in the early 1990s, when she jumped topless out of a cake at a party for one of his stepsons. The cake story may be apocryphal, but Tomisue Hilbert, who is the same age as Melania, was indeed a 23-year-old topless dancer and a single mother when she married Steve.The Hilberts once lived in a three-story, 23,000 square-foot faux-French mansion dubbed Le Chateau Renaissance, which was located on a 33-acre compound outside Indianapolis that included a 15,000-square-foot  sports barn  with a full-size reproduction of the Indiana University basketball court. The mansion, once valued at $25 million, featured Trumpesque gold-plated bathroom fixtures and French crystal chandeliers. Hand-painted murals adorned a dome above the entryway, including one depicting a toga-clad Steve Hilbert as an ancient deity.The men had been friends for nearly 20 years when they entered into a business deal together. They bought the General Motors Building in Manhattan for $800 million. Hilbert put up far more money than Trump did ($200 million vs. $11 million plus there was a third partner) but somehow, Trump received a 50 percent interest in the building. He also put his name on the building.The two men, along with their wives du jour, also socialize together. They stay in each other s vacation homes. They attend each other s multiple weddings.After a disastrous departure from his company, Conseco, Hilbert started the tanning business. While Mother Jones doesn t know for sure that Trump uses his products, they do say this:This is also around the time that Trump started to turn orange. Did the Hilberts get Trump into tanning? Does he use New Sunshine spray tans or tanning bed bronzers? (Reviewers have suggested that turning orange a  rich shade of burnt orange,  in the words of one can be a distinct side effect of using such products.) The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about whether Trump used New Sunshine tanning products. Questions sent by email and FedEx to Hilbert s Indiana home went unanswered. It s clear, though, that Trump is familiar with New Sunshine s wares. He promoted the company s tanning products on The Celebrity Apprentice in two episodes.There s more to the story, which includes some pretty shady business deals, but at least we might now know why Trump is that awful shade of orange.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Shut up and go home,  Soffer yelled while blocking the entrance to the voting booths according to Jefferson County Clerk Patricia Johnson and a voter named Victor who did not get to cast his ballot because of Soffer s interference. As a result of the disruption and confusion caused by Stu Soffer and other Republicans   I was not able to cast my ballot that day,  Victor said.According to attorney Chris Burke, who represents Victor in the lawsuit filed against Soffer,  Mr. Soffer stood in the doorway of the early-voting location and told voters to shut up and go home.

Kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. The children denied any involvement, and the officers told Kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children.According to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when Kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass. Those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock:TwitterTwitterThe News-Herald reported: The officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign, but Kubek repeated that he could not.

Trump was even briefed about this and yet he still denies that Russia is the perpetrator.And that is leading many of our closest allies to worry about what could happen if Trump becomes president.According to Newsweek,Officials from two European countries told Newsweek that Trump s comments about Russia s hacking have alarmed several NATO partners because it suggests he either does not believe the information he receives in intelligence briefings, does not pay attention to it, does not understand it or is misleading the American public for unknown reasons. One British official said members of that government who are aware of the scope of Russia s cyberattacks both in Western Europe and America found Trump s comments  quite disturbing  because they fear that, if elected, the Republican presidential nominee would continue to ignore information gathered by intelligence services in the formulation of U.S. foreign policy.And we know Russia is backing Trump because they ended their hacking campaign when it seemed like he would be replaced as the nominee by a sane Republican, only to resume hacking on Trump s behalf when he wasn t replaced.When Trump launched into an inexplicable attack on the parents of a Muslim-American soldier who died in combat, the Kremlin assumed the Republican nominee was showing himself psychologically unfit to be president and would be forced by his party to withdraw from the race. As a result, Moscow put its hacking campaign temporarily on hold, ending the distribution of documents until Trump stabilized, both personally and in the polls, according to reports provided to Western intelligence.And the United States election is not the only one Russia has interfered with. The Kremlin also spread misinformation that helped right-wingers take control in Germany and caused the United Kingdom to vote in favor of Brexit, both of which help Russia weaken alliances.But their true target is NATO, which is what stands in the way of Russia overpowering Europe, and our allies fear that a Trump victory on November 8th would embolden Russia to do just that.Officials in Western Europe say they are dismayed that they now feel compelled to gather intelligence on a man who could be the next president of the United States, but believe they have no choice. Moscow is seen as a direct threat to their interests both in its aggressive efforts to reshape global alliances and for its power to damage Western Europe, which obtains almost 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia. Should the United States, the last remaining superpower, tilt its policies away from NATO to the benefit of Russia, the alliance between America and Western Europe could be transformed in unprecedented ways. And so, for perhaps the first time since World War II, countries in Western Europe fear that the American election, should Trump win, could trigger events that imperil their national security and do potentially irreparable harm to the alliances that have kept the continent safe for decades.Here s video of Rachel Maddow explaining how big this news is via YouTube.Oh, and one more thing. While Donald Trump and Republicans continue to whine about how Hillary Clinton used a private server, it turns out Hillary was smart to do so because the Russians hacked into the State Department email system, which means if she had used that system her emails would have been obtained by the Russian government.So Russia literally wants Trump to win so they can use him as their puppet to gain more influence in the world, which means more war, less democracy, and a United States that is weaker.That cannot be allowed to happen. Clearly, the Russians like Trump, and that should make all Americans cast their votes for Hillary Clinton.Featured Image: YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

On Thursday, Trump, for not the first time, insulted a group of his military veteran supporters by saying that he s just as brave as them because he takes financial risks (he doesn t, but more on that in a bit).He started off right, for literally a fraction of a second:With five days to go until Election Day, we almost had a late-breaking campaign first: Donald Trump being self-deprecating.

Same same.Source: SlateWatch it here:Okay, Mr. Trump, since you brought up bravery, let s talk about it. You had five draft deferments, officially making you a draft dodger and if your campaign rhetoric is any indication, you re also a chicken hawk. Sending other people to die, so you can  bravely  amass your personal fortune is the opposite of bravery. It s cowardly and it s worse.As for being  financially brave,  hardly.

Why should we expect him to be any different as Commander-in-Chief. He will send other people s children to fight wars that could quite easily bankrupt us. To Trump, that would be just another day. To the rest of the country, it would be devastating.Despite all of this, despite the fact that Trump has insulted prisoners of war, veterans with PTSD, Gold Star families, and the very sacrifices of veterans, the military still supports him, although, by and large, the people in charge do not.

The two were indicted Friday after David Wildstein   another former Port Authority executive and the mastermind of the plan   named them as he pleaded guilty to his role in the lane closures.The most serious charges in the indictment could land the two behind bars for up to 20 years according to the U.S. Attorney s office. Wildstein says his intent was to  punish  Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for failing to endorse Christie for President. Public officials must use government resources for proper government purposes,  U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said of the indictments.  The indictment alleges, and Wildstein admitted, that the three defendants used Port Authority resources to exact political retribution against a public official who would not endorse the Governor for re-election, and concocted and promoted a bogus cover story to execute their plan and to cover their tracks. Attorneys for both Kelly and Baroni call Wildstein a  liar,  despite his confession, and promise that they will clear their names. The charges they face include conspiracy against civil rights, deprivation of civil rights, wire fraud, conspiring to  intentionally misapply property of an organization receiving federal benefits  and others.

It s a life most of us can never imagine while we re paying our monthly bills. So what s it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father? According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr. s, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show star s son wasn t what one might imagine. Or, given Trump s temperament, it might be exactly what you d imagine.On Facebook, Mekler told of the animosity Trump s son had for this father. I was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr. s room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son s door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,  he recalls.  There were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey. Then Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. Without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said  put on a suit and meet me outside,  and closed the door,  Melker wrote. Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking,  he continued.  He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was  Diaper Don,  because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people s beds and urinate.   I always felt terrible for him,  he continued.Mekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because  in light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country. To be clear, we are not demonizing Trump s son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melker s story is accurate or not, we re not sure, but given Trump s awful temper, it s difficult to discount it.Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool via Getty.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The practice has been extremely popular among black voters, who have been organized by groups to go to the polls directly after Sunday church services in a movement called  souls to the polls.

Young voters, of course, disproportionately vote for Democratic candidates, and the youth demographic is Trump s worst performing segment of the population (his base are older, white Americans.)North Carolina is one of the southern states with a history of suppressing the black vote, and the conservative-led Supreme Court struck down portions of the Voting Rights Act that had been put in place to provide oversight.

But the FBI has been a sieve for information about Hillary lately, which is where Baier supposedly got some of his information, and it s time to ask why.One FBI agent, who spoke to The Guardian on the condition of anonymity, might have part of the answer. In fact, he just destroyed the bureau s reputation with his truth bomb about what s actually happening. According to this agent, the FBI is basically  Trumplandia,  in that the agency isn t anything like objective about its investigations into Hillary: The currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is  the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,  and that  the reason why they re leaking is they re pro-Trump.' Apparently, their attitudes only got worse when Director James Comey decided not to recommend indicting Hillary earlier this year. A lot of Trumpkins all over the country were angry about that, most likely because she s a woman, and a clear and present threat to their chosen candidate. The witch hunts have very little to do with actual evidence that she s a criminal.But it s not just Trumpkins that can t stand her   whether they re Trumpkins or not, many in the FBI just have a very unfavorable view of Hillary. That, too, raises serious questions about the agency s integrity right now: There are lots of people who don t think Trump is qualified, but also believe Clinton is corrupt. What you hear a lot is that it s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician. The bureau has come under fire for its handling of these investigations, along with Comey s decision to send a letter to Congress about newly discovered emails just 11 days before the election. That alone was enough to give the impression that they re not objective, especially since Comey has refused to respond to that criticism.The Daily Beast also picked up on a story alleging that there are connections between Rudy Giuliani, who s got his head buried deep inside Trump s ass, and the New York City FBI office. That office pressed headquarters to continue looking into the matter of Hillary s emails after Comey declared the investigation effectively closed. Agents are pissed at Comey because they believe the failure to recommend indictment shook people s faith in the bureau.So the leaks from the bureau continue, and it s pretty clear now that the FBI is, in fact, on a witch hunt against Hillary rather than conducting legitimate investigations into legitimate problems. If anything is calling the FBI s integrity into question, it s this, rather than Comey s decision not to indict back in July.Image of Hillary Clinton by by Justin Sullivan, image of James Comey by Alex Wong, via Getty Images.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

If it s not okay for kids to do it, why is it okay for Donald Trump to do it? Bossie defended his boss, and gave a truly idiotic defense to insist that Trump doesn t cyberbully: Mr. Trump takes on his opponents and takes on the liberal media, that s not cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is mostly people hiding behind things. Mr. Trump takes on those who take him on. The interview got even more insane when Tapper grilled Bossie on Trump s misogyny and rape accusations, pointing out that a dozen women have now come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them. Bossie completely denied facts, leaving Tapper stunned. As Bossie tried to argue that there was no evidence that those numerous allegations were true, Tapper fired back with several facts about what Trump has been accused of over the last several weeks   which made Bossie look like an absolute idiot.

On the one hand, we have the chance to elect a lifelong public servant, powerful, experienced, highly qualified to be the first female President of the United States. On the other hand, a candidate who reminds us of the worst men in our lives. Men who saw a powerful woman and tried to block her rise. Our rise. Men who called us bossy, unlikable, liars, and attention seekers. Ambitious, like that s a bad thing. Reed went on to talk about how misogynists like Trump attacked women for doing things like writing books and making movies and that when women continued to achieve new heights despite them they started hurling insults like the C-word, a word that Donald Trump has used in the past. I ve been called the C-word,  Reed said.  Have you been called the C-word? Reed then pointed out that there is an anti-Hillary SuperPac called C.U.N.T. and proceeded reference Trump calling Hillary a  nasty woman  by calling upon all nasty women to vote against Trump on Election Day because  we are so very close to putting all of that behind us because nasty women vote.

Even Trump s charities have failed to give back as much as Trump says they have.Considering she d already made so many false statements, Conway decided to go for the gold when she trashed Clinton and the Democratic Party.

Or, more accurately, its presidential non-endorsement. After endorsing Trump during the primaries, his own son-in-law s paper has decided it s not endorsing anyone at all.The Observer s editor-in-chief, Ken Kurson, simply said: Observer is not going to make an endorsement in the general. Oh, ouch. That just hurts, at least for Trump. We re ecstatic. The Observer can t endorse Hillary or they d probably all get fired, and the same thing could happen if they endorsed a third-party candidate. But it seems that they can t, in good conscience, endorse their owner s father-in-law.Wow.Trump hasn t been able to get very many newspaper endorsements in the general   in fact, he s only gotten six endorsements in all, and they re all from small papers with the exception of Sheldon Adelson s Las Vegas Review-Journal. That s it. That s all. Hundreds of newspapers in the country, and Trump garners a whole six endorsements.Compare that to Hillary s dozens of newspaper endorsements, which include conservative papers like the Arizona Republic, which had never endorsed a Democratic candidate in its 126-year history, and the Dallas Morning News, which hadn t endorsed a Democrat for more than 75 years. Other papers with strong histories of endorsing Republicans likewise broke with tradition to endorse Hillary.You know your candidate just sucks horrifically when his own son-in-law s paper can t bring itself to endorse him. Amusingly, the Observer has actually had issues with its coverage of Trump because of Kushner s relationship, with Kurson saying in 2015: If we run something pro-Trump we will automatically be accused of carrying water for him (on account of the relationship to our publisher). If we run something anti-Trump, we will be accused of trying to curry favor with our peers in journalism or worse, intentionally being only a little hard on him so that later we can love him up and point to the earlier softball as proof that we re fair. So they re in an impossible position, really, but their refusal to endorse Trump at all is a blow to his standing as a candidate.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

While a parade of people both on the left and right have railed against the head of the FBI, James Comey, the most powerful voice has been from one of the key figures involved in the so-called investigation: Anthony Weiner s alleged teenage victim of sexting.According to Comey, the FBI has  learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.  Comey didn t say Clinton is being indicted. He didn t say she was even involved. He hasn t even seen the emails that may or may not implicate Clinton. It s guilt by possible association with something that might exist, and all of this bunch of nothin  came out just days before the election.The alleged victim of the sexting that is at the center of the controversy wrote an open letter (printed in Buzzfeed) that raked Comey over the coals. She s upset that she s being re-victimized to become a political tool. Here are some excerpts:In your letter, you chose to use a vague approach, meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how. Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my  story.  Why couldn t your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle?In his  cooperation  with you and with his love of the spotlight, Anthony Weiner has given information that led to the media finding me. You have assisted him in further victimizing me on every news outlet. I can only assume that you saw an opportunity for political propaganda.I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters  phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election. ..The election is important, yes, but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me, is much more important. It s time that the FBI Director puts his victims  rights above political views.The girl, who appears to be exceptionally articulate and more informed than the majority of voters on both sides of the aisle, signed the letter,  Girl that lost her faith in America.  She s not alone. This election has been one of the most bitter and contentious and fact free (on the Republican side) in our nation s history.

I said,  No   the incidents themselves have caused traumatic response in these women. They are not mentally ill. Someone who s been violated usually suffers from anxiety and depression related to the violation. The condition is not what makes women report being raped. Sadly, though, it s extremely common for our society to find ways to blame women for their trauma, rather than placing the blame squarely where it belongs   on the jackass who raped her.Crawford also said, in the interview, that she was refused access to police reports about rape on Baylor s campus, and was shut down in other ways too. Crawford told  60 Minutes Sports On Showtime  that Waco police  do not want the actual police reports turned over to Title IX . These are things the university and Ramsower vehemently deny, despite the problems Baylor is known to experience with rape, because of course they do.Why would they do that? Because reasons. All of those reasons have to do with rape culture in general. Women may not report rape for months, years, or even never, which discredits them in the eyes of the justice system and society in general. The fact that they often know their rapists just furthers the idea that they were somehow complicit.We have no universal legal definition of rape, so whether someone was actually raped often depends on how the justice system wants to define it for that particular case.But perhaps worst of all is that universities handle rape cases because of Title IX, and not because it s the right thing to do. The Department of Education can take years to investigate cases themselves, and many universities don t punish or expel the rapists, even when they re found guilty. And, in the case of Baylor, Stanford (Brock Turner) and others, athletes are treated as being above the law.Ramsower did acknowledge a failure on the part of the Waco police department to properly handle a case of gang rape.

I will say, in what we re seeing, as been noted on your show and elsewhere on the network, a lot of the vote in Florida has already been cast and elsewhere.

A recent poll, from a federal publication called Government Executive, surveyed a random sample of 1,085 federal employees across 35 agencies and found that Hillary has a commanding lead over Trump, with 53 percent saying they d vote for her vs. 35 percent saying they d vote for Trump if the election were today.Image via Government ExecutiveBut the more damning statistic was that 27 percent said they would, would consider, or might leave the federal service if Trump was elected. That s compared to 16 percent for Hillary. Nine percent said they didn t know what they d do if Trump was elected, compared to just five percent who said that about Hillary.Image via Government ExecutiveImage via Government ExecutiveFederal employees do tend to lean Democratic in part because their jobs are more secure, and they do better economically, under Democratic presidents rather than Republicans. Donald Trump just adds to the GOP s woes in this area because he s a completely incompetent fool that they allowed to become their nominee.In fact, that s evidenced in another damning part of the poll. Thirty-one percent of respondents feel that Hillary would be very effective at managing federal agencies, whereas only 18 percent feel Trump could do that job very well.

Assuming everyone who resigned was in the civilian workforce, that s well over 700,000 employees who would leave under Trump. Add the military members who could consider early retirement into that, and Trump s in a lot of trouble. At the bare minimum, Trump would have to face a workforce that, by and large, doesn t like him, along with a quick loss of hundreds of thousands employees.As for the rest of the country, the federal workforce would then fill up with Trumpkins, which could make life worse for us even faster. We sooo do not need a federal workforce full of deplorables.

He has also ordered that the RNC explain exactly what Kellyanne Conway, Trump s campaign manager, meant when she said that the campaign is working with the RNC to  monitor precincts. According to Politico, the order comes  after the Democratic National Committee went to court last week to allege that the RNC was violating consent decrees from the 1980s settling a case alleging that GOP poll watchers sought to intimidate minority voters in a practice then known as  caging.   Under these agreements, poll watchers can be organized by the GOP, but they are prohibited from  any effort to intimidate voters as they enter a polling place or to challenge individual voters, except as part of a program approved in advance by the court. The RNC insists that they have not violated the agreement. They have pointed to a memo that was sent out reminding its personnel, national committee members and others about the consent decree and instructing them to keep their distance from any ballot security efforts. The memos tell RNC workers, officials and volunteers not to engage in poll watching efforts at all, not to take video or audio recordings at polling places and not to mention ballot fraud concerns on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. But this isn t what Trump s supporters are being told by those at the top of their party s ticket. Like Conway, Mike Pence has indicated that the campaign is in cahoots with the RNC to ensure  ballot integrity  at the polls.During an August town hall meeting in Denver, Pence said,  the Trump Campaign and the Republican National Committee are working very, very closely with state governments and secretaries of state all over the country to ensure ballot integrity. Similarly, just last month, Conway said that the that the Trump campaign is  actively working with the national committee, the official party, and campaign lawyers to monitor precincts around the country. On Monday, it was announced that Democratic party leaders from four states had filed lawsuits against Donald Trump, his advisor Roger Stone, and the state Republican parties for conspiring to threaten, intimidate, and thereby prevent minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting in the 2016 election.

The lawsuit was originally filed in California but was thrown out because the original complaint did not state any specific civil rights violations. She refiled in New York in June, dropping some of the harder-to-prove claims and replacing them with two new witnesses. Both witnesses claim they worked as  party planners  for Trump s pedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein, who threw them some cash to  attract adolescent women  to the billionaire s mansion.One witness says she lured Jane Doe to a party by promising her cash and modeling contracts   but instead the 13-year-old child was forced to have sex with Trump and Epstein, both of whom knew how young she was. I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop,  Tiffany Doe says, adding that she also witnessed Doe and a 12-year-old girl named  Maria  being forced to perform oral sex on Trump, with the 2016 GOP nominee physically abusing both children afterward   all of this as part of her job duties that required her to   personally witness and supervise encounters between the underage girls that Mr. Epstein hired and his guests. Both Trump and Epstein threatened to hurt Doe if she told anyone about the horrific assaults, with Trump adding a very Trump-like threat: I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn t ever say anything if she didn t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed. Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution and served 13 months in prison   but Trump went on to find himself one goose-step away from being the leader of the free world.While this might seem unbelievable, Trump hasn t exactly hidden his lust for children over the years, going on about how hot Paris Hilton was when she was 12, creeping on underage models in their dressing rooms, and repeatedly talking about how much he wants to have sex with his daughter, Ivanka.You can read the allegations below:  Donald Trump & Jeffrey Epstein Rape Lawsuit and Affidavits by davidbix on ScribdFeatured image via Getty Images/win McNamee""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

While it could be expected that Democrats would be furious that Comey would do such a thing just 11 days before what is easily the hottest national election cycle in recent memory, Comey is getting pushback from unexpected sources as well: Republicans.Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had harsh words for Comey, saying in part, via a letter: Unfortunately, your letter failed to give Congress and the American people enough context to evaluate the significance or full meaning of this development. Without additional context, your disclosure is not fair to Congress, the American people, or Secretary Clinton. Grassley, of course, is far from the only person of influence who is troubled by Comey s actions. Despite his reputation as a man of integrity, people on both sides of the aisle regard Friday s letter as a grave mistake. Grassley s letter continued: In the absence of additional, authoritative information from the FBI in the wake of your vague disclosure, Congress and the American people are left to sift through anonymous leaks from Justice Department officials to the press of varying levels of detail, reliability, and consistency. The American people deserve better than that. Grassley is right. The only possible connection those emails have to Hillary Clinton is the fact that the computer they were found on was shared by her longtime aide, Huma Abedin, who, of course, is the estranged wife of Anthony Weiner. Weiner, of course, is the disgraced former Congressman being investigated for allegedly sexting with a minor. So, in other words, nothing to see here folks.Perhaps most startling of all was a tweet from former Congressman Joe Walsh, who is now a right-wing radio host known for being an avid Trump supporter and is no stranger to controversy, including social media posts that could be interpreted as calls to violence.

However, while he was busy avoiding taxes in the 1990s, his own lawyers warned him against doing, well, exactly what he did.A new report in The New York Times explains that, order to avoid total financial ruin, Trump didn t report hundreds of millions that was technically income. He didn t just not report it, though   the IRS would have seen through that immediately. Instead, his first step to avoiding taxes was successfully pushing his various bondholders to cancel the hundreds of millions he owed them.To the IRS, a dollar of canceled debt is a dollar of taxable income. That could have crippled the self-proclaimed master of debt and taxes about as badly as all that debt he couldn t pay. So what did he do? He used what s called a  stock-for-debt  swap maneuver.Except Congress banned that practice for corporations in 1993. However, Trump s real estate holdings in Atlantic City the ones that were all in trouble weren t corporations. They were partnerships. So he thought he could still swap what s called  partnership equity  for his debt.Apparently, this works even if the stocks, or, in Trump s case, the equities, are worth considerably less than the canceled debt. The Times says that this is as close as anyone can get to making taxes just magically disappear.But legally, this is fraught with its own problems and Trump s own lawyers actually warned him against doing it. He asked his tax attorneys for formal opinion letters on his plan, which all came back saying: The letters bluntly warned that there was no statute, regulation or judicial opinion that explicitly permitted Mr. Trump s tax gambit.  Due to the lack of definitive judicial or administrative authority,  his lawyers wrote,  substantial uncertainties exist with respect to many of the tax consequences of the plan.' In other words, they felt that his scheme wouldn t stand up to IRS scrutiny. We don t know if the IRS went after him for this because nobody has the whole story. However, from what we do have, tax expert and former chief tax council for the House Ways and Means Committee, John L. Buckley, was able to say: He s getting something for absolutely nothing. Buckley also said: He deducted somebody else s losses. He is double dipping big time. Buckley means that the only people who should have been able to deduct those losses were the bondholders who canceled his debts, and thus, lost out on their investments.This could be one of the bombshells he s hiding in his tax returns. Since all of this involved partnerships, profits could go straight to his personal returns, as could other items. With Trump refusing to release those, though, we don t know just how badly he stretched the law, if not broke it altogether.This scheme quite possibly laid the groundwork for his massive $916 million loss in 1995, which may have allowed him to avoid paying taxes again for 20 years. In other words, not only has he possibly sailed along while Americans who earn an honest day s pay for an honest day s work dutifully paid their taxes, but he very likely broke the law in all his machinations here in a way that the regular Americans he claims to understand would never get away with (hell, we wouldn t even know where to start, most likely).Oddly enough, using partnership equity swaps to avoid taxes was banned by Congress in 2004. Among the Senators who voted to close that loophole was Hillary Clinton.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This was for an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client critical of the celebrity mogul. (Before the former spy was retained, the project s financing switched to a client allied with Democrats.)  It started off as a fairly general inquiry,  says the former spook, who asks not to be identified. But when he dug into Trump, he notes, he came across troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government. According to his sources, he says,  there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit. The spy tells the magazine that the Trump-Putin exchange is  an extraordinary situation. According to the report (reviewed by Mother Jones):  Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance. Trump s former manager Paul Manafort is currently the subject of an FBI inquiry, probing his connection to foreign governments associated with Putin.

On Monday, Kellyanne Conway showed up on CNBC to do what she does best: embarrass the human race with her stupidity.Apparently satisfied with Trump s ability to latch on to the next-to-no information referenced by FBI Director Comey s unethical, unprecedented, and likely illegal letter to Republicans. Comey hasn t reviewed the emails discovered on a computer owned by renowned pervert and husband to unfortunate Clinton aide Huma Abedin,  Anthony Weiner, who is currently being  investigated for allegedly sexting a 15-year-old girl.The emails likely contain nothing new and have likely already been disclosed, but the Right is in the midst of a feeding frenzy over the non-information contained in the letter, declaring that the investigation into Clinton s emails had been reopened and ramping up the  criminal  rhetoric.Conway condemned Clinton s suggestion that all the emails be released to the public   in other words, an effort to fully inform the public   as she called the Clinton campaign  sneaky  for demanding the facts be released. Just ask Huma what s on there, just ask Anthony Weiner what s on there,  she said during the interview.  They are now trying to politicize the FBI.  Conway accused Clinton of  encouraging  supporters to boo Comey, who has such a reaction coming for his unethical behavior in the eyes of pretty much anyone who doesn t consider red trucker hats fashionable. It s a very dangerous precedent to have somebody that was secretary of state, first lady, U.S. senator, wants to be president of the United States and be commander-in-chief encouraging people to boo,  she said, apparently forgetting a time not so long ago when Trump and his illiterate, inbred fans also booed the FBI (and Comey specifically). And where are we now?  Conway said after host Andrew Ross Sorkin pointed out that Trump has called for Clinton s imprisonment multiple times.  She is going to be in her second FBI investigation. One FBI investigation, let alone two, do we think this is normal? I think people have been asking the right questions about the wrong candidate. Who s really unqualified? Who s unfit to be president? Who has shown what they would do with their national security information? Who has shown it s always about her and her petty peevish political self? Then Sorkin struck a nerve by stating facts   namely that Trump has been named in a rather damning child rape lawsuit that is due to start in December. The girl in question is 13   just one year older than Paris Hilton when Trump says she was hot and two years younger than the models he used to creep on in their dressing rooms. My understanding is that no matter who wins, we re going to be dealing with the email issue after this if she s the president,  Sorkin told Conway.  If Donald Trump is the president, he s got the child rape case that s going to happen that was just given a date. Naturally, Conway snorted and attempted to deflect, calling any question about the child rape case exactly as legitimate as questions about Trump s taxes, which he has not released: Oh, come on, that you would analogize the two. Give me a break,  she seethed. Next you are going to ask me where his taxes are. That s a whole separate issue, but we re going to have legal cases for each candidate,  Sorkin countered. But to Conway, a little child rape is unimportant when Hillary sent some emails and Anthony Weiner is a bit pervy, too: That s such a ridiculous conflation. To just throw the rape word in there when we ve got 650,000 emails based on an active investigation of Huma Abedin s pedophilia husband because he s sexting pictures of himself to some 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, I think that s just ridiculous.

Yet Trump flouted the orders and had the evidence destroyed rather than produce something in court that might help his opponent win the case.This is what is known as  spoliation of evidence  which  is the intentional, reckless, or negligent withholding, hiding, altering, fabricating, or destroying of evidence relevant to a legal proceeding. Such actions are a criminal act and are punishable by a fine or imprisonment.As many times as Trump has committed these acts, he should have been behind bars by now. And he certainly should not be allowed to be president, because it s clear that Trump has no problem ordering his employees to break the law and would most definitely run one of the most secretive administrations in American history. Transparency would no longer exist because Trump hides anything that could hurt him.He has already demonstrated this behavior on the campaign trail by refusing to release his tax returns and his medical records, and now we know that Trump regularly destroys documents and email evidence despite such evidence being ordered provided by a court of law.Hillary Clinton s emails were a one-time mistake that other former Secretaries of State have made, including Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, both of whom are Republicans who served in Republican administrations. Nobody made a fuss when they used private servers, yet Trump and his rabid fans are whining about Hillary doing the same thing. If anything, Hillary Clinton is way more transparent than Trump has ever been. She didn t permanently delete the emails. They have all been recovered, which means there wasn t an actual effort to nefariously hide anything. Furthermore, she has released her medical records and tax returns. And she has never destroyed evidence in defiance of a court order.So while Trump s supporters are chanting  lock her up,  it s actually Donald Trump who should be in prison right now.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He also has many friends who are current and former elected officials. He recently posted a most disturbing conversation he had with a friend who just happens to be a former GOP congressman on Facebook, and it exposes just how crazy the Donald Trump phenomenon is, and how much control Trump and his crazy supporters have over the Republican Party. Here is the transcript of that post:Yesterday I spoke with a former Republican member of Congress whom I ve known for years.Me: What do you think of your party s nominee for president?He: Trump is a maniac. He s a clear and present danger to America.Me: Have you said publicly that you won t vote for him?He (sheepishly): No.Me: Why not?He: I m a coward.Me: What do you mean?He: I live in a state with a lot of Trump voters. Most Republican officials do.Me: But you re a former official. You re not running for Congress again. What are you afraid of?He: I hate to admit it, but I m afraid of them. Some of those Trumpistas are out of their fu*king minds.Me: You mean you re afraid for your own physical safety?He: All it takes is one of them, you know.Me: Wait a minute. Isn t this how dictators and fascists have come to power in other nations? Respected leaders don t dare take a stand.He: At least I m no Giuliani or Gingrich or Pence. I m not a Trump enabler.Me: I ll give you that.He: Let me tell you something. Most current and former Republican members of Congress are exactly like me. I talk with them. They think Trump is deplorable. And they think Giuliani and Gingrich are almost as bad. But they re not gonna speak out. Some don t want to end their political careers. Most don t want to risk their lives. The Trump crowd is just too dangerous. Trump has whipped them up into a g*ddamn frenzy.And here is the embed:This is what has happened to one of America s two major political parties. They have propped up a literal fascist and are currently doing all they can to put him in the Oval Office and give him control of the most dangerous nuclear arsenal in the world. That is frighteningly, chillingly irresponsible. If we all die, you know who to thank.These people are cowards, and you cannot be a leader and a coward at the same time. They have no leadership skills. Part of being a good leader is doing the right thing when it counts, and it s clear that the current GOP leadership is incapable of doing that.All I can hope is that the entire GOP is just like Reich s friend   and when they enter the privacy of the voting booth, they vote to save the world from that lunatic that somehow rose to the top of the GOP presidential ticket, rather than voting to save their own political hides.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Unfortunately, they do exist here, and some of them decided to do something unspeakably disgusting and cruel for Halloween. Calling themselves  Christians,  which they aren t, they put together a haunted house with 10 rooms   one of which showed the mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando.Pulse was a club frequented by the LGBTQ community, and there are many on the religious right who seem to think that the victims of that horror simply got what was coming to them. The so-called  Christians  who put this atrocity together called it,  THE ROOM: A JOURNEY TO HELL. What s the implication there? It s pretty clear. In each of the 10 rooms were scenes in which people supposedly made choices that would send them to hell. The inclusion of the Pulse shooting indicates that the group who put this together believes that the clubgoers who were brutally murdered that night went to hell due to their  choice  of living the  homosexual lifestyle. Ergo, getting murdered was what they deserved for willfully committing that sin.The haunted house was to happen at Fernwood Elementary School, which is part of Chicago Public Schools. An elementary school is not an appropriate venue for anything like this, even though children under 13 were supposedly prohibited from going through it. CPS very wisely decided not to allow the haunted house at all, according to the Windy City Times, and a spokesperson for CPS said: The event organizers mischaracterized the true content of the event, and we did not approve any association with the activities the organizers have now advertised. The event will not be held on CPS property. Because of course they did.The event organizers posted an ad on Facebook asking for volunteers for the event, and the event has now been banned there, too, as well it should be. This is Christian extremism run amok, and there is no place for this kind of gruesome hatred in our society.Featured image by Gerardo Mora via Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Comey has said he was obligated to tell Congress that he d found more emails, but the law may say otherwise.The Hatch Act, which prevents ICE from endorsing Donald Trump despite his repeated claims, also bars government officials from using their positions to influence the outcome of an election. Comey s, ahem, poorly timed revelation could, in fact, be seen as using his position as director of the FBI to influence this election. Reid said, point blank: I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.

However, given that he s a Republican, he could be up to any number of things. It could be as innocent as that. Or perhaps he thinks he can restore some of his standing among his party, which took a hit after he said he wasn t filing charges against Hillary.He could also be responding to all the squeaky wheels in Congress who are bitching up one side and down the other that Hillary is guilty, is a threat to national security and is therefore unqualified to be President; and screaming and crying about Comey not doing his job.But it s the last part of Reid s letter that will really hit Comey where it hurts. Congressional Republicans tried to filibuster his nomination away, and Reid stood up for him. Reid said: Please keep in mind that I have been a supporter of yours in the past. When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant.With deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""When a Fox News host tried to whine about the way the media has been covering Donald Trump, Mark Cuban dropped a truth bomb on him.Throughout this campaign, the Republican nominee has said increasingly more bombastic statements. In fact, Trump s rhetoric and behavior are totally unprecedented, which is why the media is covering him the way they do.But Trump has repeatedly complained about the media covering the things he has said and done, which is why he has been blaming them for his low poll numbers and is accusing them of rigging the election against him.And Fox host Howard Kurtz tried to push the Trump line on Sunday, only to be derailed by real billionaire Mark Cuban. The media coverage of Trump in the last couple of months has been overwhelmingly negative,  Kurtz whined. But Cuban was quick to point out that Donald Trump only has himself to blame for the way the media covers him. Well, that s of his own making, isn t it? If you re going to say the things that he says, and if you re going to make the flippant comments that he makes, you re going to get covered. I mean, all he had to do was shut up nine out of ten times and the coverage would be distinctly different. That s just not something he s capable of doing. Cuban is exactly right. Donald Trump did this to himself by simply opening his mouth and saying and doing things that he shouldn t. He just doesn t want to take responsibility for his words and behavior so he is making the media his scapegoat and his supporters believe him.When Kurtz complained that the media is hostile towards Trump, Cuban once again informed the Fox host Trump knew what he was getting into when he threw his hat into the presidential arena. Look, on the way up, he was happy to ride the train, right? He bragged about media coverage, he was excited about it, he loved the live coverage of the primaries and early on the presidential race. It s a two-edged sword, you know that. So if you re going to love it on the way up, you got to learn to deal with it. Here s the video via YouTube.Once again, Mark Cuban is spot on. Donald Trump has seen a lot of presidential elections in his lifetime so he should know that media coverage of presidential candidates is intense. And Howard Kurtz should know that the primary job of the media is to cover the candidates because that s what journalism is all about. It s not that the media s coverage of Trump is negative, it s that Trump has made himself and his campaign negative from the start and he has made no effort to tone it down.So if Trump wants the media to start covering him differently, he ll have to change first. And that probably won t happen any time soon.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"
