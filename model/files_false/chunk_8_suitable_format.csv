While Trump might have enjoyed his little run-through of the museum, not everyone was happy about it   and many of them took to social media  o blast him for it.One Instagram user, josh_andew, posted a photo of the candidate and captioned it,  Ugh a Trump sighting in NYC #Hillary2016 #NoTrump :InstagramTwitter also blew up with insults directed at the GOP candidate, many bringing up the fact that Trump has been the most anti-Muslim candidate, and criticizing him for using the museum visit as a campaign stunt.TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterThis tweet, in particular, nailed Trump s fake personality so well:TwitterNothing that Trump does is genuine, or without some sort of benefit in it for him. In the years between the opening of the museum and the start of his campaign, Trump was apparently too busy to pay his respects to the thousands of people who were killed in the terrorist attacks   even though he himself said that he  lost hundreds of friends  at the World Trade Center.But now because he s running for president, Trump is suddenly making it a priority to seem more appreciative of  New York values  than his rival Ted Cruz, who recently offended New Yorkers. It s obvious that blasting Cruz was part of Trump s plan all along when you read the end of this statement from Trump s campaign:This statement comes just a day after Trump blasted Cruz at a rally, saying: Remember when he started lecturing me on New York values like we re no good? We all know people who died, and I ve got this guy standing over there looking at me and talking to me about  New York values  with scorn on his face, with hatred of New York. Trump had also made a $100,000 donation to the museum, which never received a cent from Trump s charitable foundation before he was running for president. Actually, there isn t one 9/11-related nonprofit group that Trump made a contribution to until now, despite the fact that Trump feels so passionately about the rescue workers and survivors of the terror attacks. Trump doesn t give a damn about the victims, survivors or families affected by 9/11   he only cares about making himself look better.

This might seem crazy at first   after all, Ivanka has been campaigning hard for daddy, and Eric Trump appeared alongside his brother as the latter offered to ship their father s black critics out of the country. But as crazy as it seems, it is true.The state of New York has incredibly strict voter registration laws   ones that promise to create issues for people of both parties. As with many states, New York operates on a  closed primary  system. Simply put, you cannot vote in a party s primary unless you are registered with that party. Normally, simply switching parties would solve the issue nicely, but the Empire State has the earliest change-of-party deadline in the country   October 9 (of last year), which is six months before the primary election.Yahoo News reports that both Eric and Ivanka are not registered as Republicans in the state:Donald Trump s three oldest children have campaigned with their father and served as surrogates during the presidential race. But only one of them is actually a member of the party Trump hopes to lead.Records from the New York State Board of Elections show that neither Ivanka Trump nor Eric Trump is enrolled in a political party. Trump s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., is a Republican.In other words, only the son who actively courted white supremacists on behalf of his father is able to vote for him in the upcoming primary. Sure, they support him, but it has to be humiliating for The Donald that two of his oldest children will not be casting a ballot for him.Registration for new voters in New York is more lenient, with a deadline of March 25   but even if Ivanka and Eric are unregistered, it is still too late for them to cast a vote for The Annoying Orange.This could also be bad news for Bernie Sanders, who has been swiftly closing the gap between himself and Hillary Clinton in the state. Since he has been converting people of varying political persuasions since he announced his candidacy, it is likely that many of his supporters will not be able to cast a ballot for him. Think Progress reports:When it comes to New York s fast-approaching presidential primary election, Lerner said potential voters from both parties would likely be impacted by New York s strict election rules. But she said that people voting for  the two non-establishment candidates    Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and billionaire Donald Trump   would bear the brunt of the confusion. That s because voters for those candidates were more likely to have been previously unaffiliated with a political party, or more likely to have wanted to switch parties to vote for their preferred candidate.Sanders supporters even set up a page back in October raising the alarm about the change-of-party deadline for independents and voters registered with more liberal factions like the Green Party or the Liberal Party.So far, it seems true that non-establishment candidates like Trump and Sanders tend to do better in open primaries, where people can vote in whichever party s primary they choose.Both Sanders and Trump stand to take a hard hit from New York s strict party-switching regulations, though he is sure to be a hit among first-time voters, who registered in record numbers in New York this year. The full impact of already-registered voters who wanted to switch parties to vote for the candidate of their choice remains to be seen, but one thing is certain   Trump s kids will be sitting this primary out.Featured Image via Getty/Jeff J.

As of 9:43 PM EST With 100 percent reporting, Sanders has 55.7 percent, while Clinton has 44.3 percent.

A victory there could give Bernie Sanders the push he needs to win the Democratic presidential nomination. He is currently down roughly 200 pledged delegates after Hillary Clinton built a substantial delegate lead in the South. With her best states behind her, Bernie Sanders has slowly chipped away at that lead since March 15th.Whether you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, Hillary Clinton supporter, or still teetering between the two candidates, what Bernie Sanders  campaign has accomplished so far is amazing. Income and wealth inequality has never received this much attention in recent years, and calls for getting money out of politics have never been greater. Excitement and passion of Americans to participate in the Democratic process of voting are unprecedented.

This week, Watters and his punch-me face took on the students of Princeton University and it didn t go well:In one of the most bizarre segments on Fox News you ll ever see, Bill O Reilly sent his interviewer to Princeton to say the word  ghetto  to black students   and it went pretty much as you d expect.Jesse Watters, who often interviews people on the street for The O Reilly Factor, visited the school s campus and asked students of different races if they were offended by various loaded words and phrases, such as  ghetto,   black crime,   slum,   Islamic terrorism,  and  white privilege. Now, I m not exactly a fan of college PC culture but there s a difference between someone crying about  cultural appropriation  (get over it. If it s cool, other people are going to want to try it) and being offended by the word  ghetto  with its obvious and well known racial overtones. That being said, I was delighted to see just how badly Watters, the human-weasel hybrid, failed to  expose  PC culture run amok.Not only did expert douchebag Watters not find anyone that fit the stereotype he was looking for, the ones he tried to shoehorn in had to be obviously edited to seem irrational. And even then, they really didn t. One black student responded quite reasonably to being asked about people using the word  ghetto  by saying, I feel like they should be more careful in their choice of words,  and another simply walked away from an obvious trap. Other students either refused to take the bait or gave a measured and intelligent response: It s that kind of elitism, classism, that kind of snobbery  is counterproductive, it dehumanizes people. The whole segment flopped horribly. Paid stalker Watters told one student,  You re a woman and you re white. That s how you got into Princeton  and he used a bad edit to make it seem like she responded by saying  And I m actually kind of upset about that.

His two children were in the back seat of the vehicle.The off-duty officer who claims the man pointed a gun at him, identified as William Wright of the Houston Police Department, was driving his own personal vehicle at the time of the encounter.In the first few moments of the video, Carmona can be seen pulling in behind the officer s pickup truck, before parking his own vehicle.Carmona says he was in a hurry to get inside the store because he had to use the restroom. He admits that there was a gun in the pocket of the driver s side door.Carmona says that as he was getting out of the car, the gun somehow fell out of the car. I don t know if I hit it when I opened the door, or hit it with my foot everything just happened so fast,  he told KHOU.The video shows Carmona opening the door to his vehicle, then bending over as if to pick something up off of the ground. He immediately turns back toward his own vehicle, apparently to return the fallen object to the car.It s at this point that officer Wright can be seen getting out of his pickup truck with his gun drawn on Carmona. I put my hands up like,  Sir,  I apologized right away,  Carmona said.  Sir, I apologize,  because the first thing that come to my mind, I dropped a gun in front of an officer, without even knowing it. Wright ordered Carmona to the ground, placing the man in handcuffs as his children watch from the car.At one point his young son can be seen getting out of the car as his father lay face down on the ground. He comes behind me, he starts handcuffing me and my son comes out of the truck. That was the last thing I wanted,  he told KHOU.In his official report, Wright wrote that Carmona pointed a gun at him twice, causing him to fear for his life.He was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, a felony offense under Texas law.But the video clearly shows that the Texas father never pointed a gun at officer Wright.It should not go without saying that carrying a gun in a vehicle with two children riding inside is a terrible, terrible idea.From the video and Carmona s own statements, it appears that he intended to leave the gun in the car with his children while he used the convenience store bathroom. That is something no parent should ever do.Be that as it may, it s not a crime in the state of Texas.Carmona has a legal permit to carry a concealed weapon.In an apparent effort to discredit him, police brought up a 2007 charge which was dismissed through deferred adjudication.What s more, video from inside the store shows that Officer Wright has stopped there to purchase beer, something officers in uniform are barred from doing under department policy.Regardless of how you feel about concealed carry laws, there s no justification for this kind of dishonesty and abuse of power on the part of police.Here s more on this story, including footage from the surveillance video, via KHOU.Featured image via video screen capture via KHOU""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Duncan Hunter has been busted for doing.According to the San Diego Union Tribune,Campaign finance reports show $5,339 in such charges during 2015 alone: $1,128 in travel, $1,650 to Hunter s children s school in El Cajon, $1,424 for video games and $1,137 paid to an oral and facial surgeon.The forms list only one personal expense that was actually paid back by Hunter   $169 on Oct. 21, with no indication of which personal expense was being reimbursed. None of the other outstanding charges were listed as repaid, or as an ongoing debt to the campaign for the year-end accounting.So it s hard to believe that Hunter will actually pay back the funds he and his family have stolen to enrich themselves like he said he would do in a statement. There was no taxpayer money involved, and I take full responsibility, Hunter said before claiming that he s  going to pay everything back by tomorrow morning, with interest. Hunter has been a member of the House of Representatives since 2013, and it didn t take long before he and his family started personally gaining financially off campaign funds.Even his own wife gets paid $3,000 a month as his supposed campaign manager.And Hunter clearly knows that he has been breaking the law all this time even though he lamely blamed the video game charges on his own son despite admitting that he and his wife are the only ones who had a campaign credit card.The Tribune reports that  a $1,650 payment on Sept. 21 to Christian Unified Schools   where Hunter s three children attend   was listed as a  personal expense   to be paid back  on Hunter s form for the period ending Dec. 31. Hunter literally listed a payment as a  personal expense,  which provides all the evidence the Federal Election Commission needs to throw the book at him.This is yet another example of the hypocrisy Republicans have demonstrated. For years, the GOP has attacked food stamp recipients of living on the dole. Meanwhile, a Republican like Hunter uses campaign funds to pay for lavish personal expenses instead of using his own bank account. The difference is that food stamp recipients actually NEED food stamps to put food on the table. That s not laziness, it s survival. What Hunter is doing on the other hand, is laziness and theft and not only should he be forced to pay back every cent, he should be forced to resign.Featured image: YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But the new law overturns the ordinance, barring cities and counties from passing their own anti-discrimination laws.In addition, the law also prevents cities and counties from raising the minimum wage, allows employers to fire workers for any reason, and outlaws transgender people from using the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. Basically, the four-page law makes North Carolina a crappier place to live.As predicted, businesses are not happy about this law and it s already hurting the state as Paypal has cancelled a project in the state that would have created hundreds of jobs. And most prominently, Bruce Springsteen cancelled a concert in Greensboro rather than perform in a state that discriminates against their own citizens. To my mind, it s an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognizing the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress,  the legendary rocker wrote in a statement condemning the law.  Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry   which is happening as I write   is one of them. It is the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards. And in response, North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Walker, who is also a pastor, threw a tantrum over the cancellation in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.Claiming that the law is merely meant to catch  imposters  who would somehow take advantage of laws protecting transgender people, Walker called Springsteen a  bully. Bruce is known to be on the radical left,  Walker whined.  He s got every right to be so, but I consider this a bully tactic. It s like when a kid gets upset and says he s going to take his ball and go home. Walker then pointed out upcoming concerts that are coming to the state. We ve got other artists coming soon   Def Leppard, Justin Bieber,  Walker said. I ve never been a Bieber fan, but I might have to go. Maybe artists who weren t  born to run  deserve a little bit more support. Yeah, and now that you ve professed your support of these artists, they should probably consider running as far away from the bigoted state of North Carolina as possible. Because the last thing Def Leppard and Justin Bieber would want is to be endorsed by a Republican who supports discriminating against people, especially since many of those people are their fans.Walker and his fellow Republicans are the real bullies in North Carolina. This bill isn t about  imposters  at all. That s merely the excuse the GOP used to pass the law despite the fact that there have been zero instances of sex offenders using LGBT protection to defend predatory behavior across 17 states and over 200 cities.Make no mistake, Republicans brought these economic consequences upon their state themselves by legalizing discrimination when they could have followed Charlotte s lead and passed a similar law covering the entire state.

When he asks why she did that, she mocks him   because that s apparently what adults do these days.Hastings was removed from the classroom and placed on paid administrative leave. She was released on $2,500 bond and slapped with a  misdemeanor assault charge. In a statement, Beaumont Independent School District s Special Assistant to the Superintendent, Nakisha Burns, explained that the teacher would be terminated and vowed that such abuse would not be tolerated:The Beaumont Independent School District can confirm that an Ozen High School teacher was arrested today for physically assaulting a student. The conduct was substantiated by video footage viewed by BISD police and administration. The District is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our students. BISD does not condone employees abusing any child and will not tolerate such conduct.

Crypt-Keeper Scott could only stand there and take credit for the economy recovering from a recession his state s housing market bubble helped create with that disturbing smile on his face that is rumored to consume the souls of small children and fluffy kittens:Scott answers her criticism with  We ve a million new jobs.  Yes, that s true. Unfortunately, far too many of those jobs will serve to lift unemployed people up and dump them into the  Medicaid gap  of income between qualifying for Medicaid and subsidies for the Health Care Marketplace. Scott didn t have anything to say about the signing of archaic abortion laws and deep budget cuts to any clinic that provides any abortion services, including Planned Parenthood.That video has gone viral, with more than 2 million views, and for poor little Ricky, that just couldn t stand. He felt the need to release this attack on a woman who clearly had the interests of the average person in mind when she gave him a piece of her mind:The answer to criticism from a Republican Governor is about as stereotypical as can be nowadays: The ad s narrator calls her names and dumps rhetoric about how many jobs have been created in a state whose economic growth and unemployment numbers basically mirror that of the rest of the country.Then they find it more appealing to attack her political views rather than address the issue of healthcare. Because all those people who want silly things like affordable ways to see a doctor are just lazy whiners looking for public assistance.Rick Scott, as usual, is completely disconnected from the reality of the people he  serves.

Now if all those people would get behind the Republican candidate, I think we could win this election despite the alienation, frankly, of a lot of the Hispanic voters.Two things: one, there s no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections (a statement that was rated true by Politifact), and two: do not underestimate Hispanic voters. As the Huffington Post notes, the Hispanic and Latino voting bloc could  tip the scales  for Democrats in Arizona. And, as of right now, the majority of them support Ann Kirkpatrick.The angry white vote can only carry McCain so far.

McCain, who already revealed that his Latino outreach efforts are a  pure, political move, has changed his positions on important issues such as immigration reform and the DREAM Act, depending on who he talks to or whether it s an election year.

He is currently trying to avoid jail time, with his lawyers having the nerve to claim that his declining health and the public scorn he has received since the abuse came to light is punishment enough.Hastert was part of the Republican-orchestrated impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998 that failed to remove him from office for an extramarital affair.Hastert became Speaker of the House in 1999, after Newt Gingrich stepped down due to Republicans losing seats in the 1999 election and the next in line for the office, Bob Livingston, also exposed for having an extramarital affair.It was widely believed that Hastert took his orders from then-Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay, and the two soon worked together to smash existing House rules in order to get Republican advantages during his time at the top.His tenure lasted until 2007, by which time Democrats had taken over the House in large part due to a scandal involving Rep.

Right-to-work laws prohibit businesses and unions from reaching agreements that require all workers, not just union members, to pay union dues. Twenty-four other states have such laws.The unions argued that Wisconsin s law was an unconstitutional seizure of union property since unions now must extend benefits to workers who don t pay dues. Dane County Circuit Judge William Foust agreed.He said the law amounts to an unconstitutional governmental taking of union funds without compensation since under the law unions must represent people who don t pay dues. That presents an existential threat to unions, Foust wrote.Wisconsin s Attorney General Brad Schimel said that the state plans on appealing the decision. Schimel released a statement where he said: We are extremely disappointed that the Dane County Circuit Court struck down Wisconsin s right-to-work law, but we are confident the law will be upheld on appeal. The ruling is great news for organized labor who have been fighting the anti-labor law. Phil Neuenfeldt, the president of Wisconsin AFL-CIO released a statement where he said: Today, the courts put a needed check on Scott Walker s attacks on working families by ruling that Wisconsin s Right to Work law is in violation of our state constitution  Right to Work goes against the Wisconsin principles of fairness and democracy and hurts all of Wisconsin by eroding the strength of our middle class.

Although fourteen Republicans have agreed to meet with the overly-qualified nominee, they have all pledged they will do so only out of courtesy   and not to consider him.However, as usual, there appears to be only one grown-up in the room, and that would be Senator Susan Collins, the moderate from Maine.Collins, who has served Maine for nearly 20 years and has often crossed party lines, sat down with Garland earlier this week to go over Constitutional, issue based questions.And what happened after she met with Garland? Well, for starters, she really seems to like him, telling reporters at the Captiol: He has a humility about him. He has clearly thought very deeply about the issues confronting the courts, there was not any question he could not handle and he has a long record of accomplishment. She also referred tom garland as  thorough  and  impressive,  saying his answers to her questions raised no red flags and were pretty down the middle as expected.But the most telling of all is how the meeting left the Senator. Breaking from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, Collins states,  The meeting left me more convinced than ever that the process should proceed,  meaning hearings should be scheduled and the nominee should have his up or down vote. The next step, in my view, should be public hearings before the Judiciary Committee so that the issues that we explored in my office can be publicly aired. Although Collins is convinced, she expressed doubts that her actions would influence other Senators who have remained shockingly loyal to Grassley and McConnell. Just last week Collins said she was utterly  perplexed  at the amount of pettiness exhibited by the Senate GOP.Surprisingly, Collins has received very little blow back from her own base. That s what happens when politicians actually do what the people want. Currently, 52 percent of Americans support holding a hearing for Garland, including 55 percent of Republicans.

The law would re-segregate our restrooms and force the state to impose restrictions on what bathrooms transgender individuals are allowed to use.The bill would require public restrooms to direct people to use the bathroom that aligns with their birth sex, and it would bar local governments from letting trans individuals choose which bathroom to use on their own.Let s pause for a moment and think about the first portion of that law. To enforce this law, you would need to staff public bathrooms with at least one security guard, who would require a birth certificate and visual inspection of the genitals of an individual before allowing them to use any restroom open to the public. That is literally the only way a law like this would actually be enforceable.This begs the question; what is the criminal penalty going to be for using the bathroom? Would it be a monetary fine, jail time or would it be a combination of both?Can you imagine the headlines? Local resident busted in bathroom sting by law enforcement, gets 6 months in jail for peeing.Despite Nikki s reluctance to sign this bill, the unfortunate part is that this isn t about new Republican support for transgendered individuals. There is no reason to think this has to do with anything other than money   corporate money, to be exact. North Carolina is seeing the massive corporate fallout from the passage of their own anti-LGBT legislation. Big money is pulling out of North Carolina now, and Nikki Haley is terrified of the same thing happening in her state.Governor Haley tried to sound benevolent about it, suggesting that protecting  religious freedom  and our public bathrooms were not necessary: This is not a battle that we ve seen is needed in South Carolina. It s not something that we see that citizens are asking for. When we look at our situation, we re not hearing of anybody s religious liberties that are being violated, and we re again not hearing any citizens that are being violated in terms of freedoms. Like it or not, South Carolina is doing really well when it comes to respect and when it comes to kindness and when it comes to acceptance. For people to imply it s not, I beg to differ. Source: TPMIt s as if Nikki Haley forgot what party she belongs to. She actually is implying protections of  religious freedom  are not necessary. Republicans will hate her for this one.As usual, the Republicans pushing for the bill say it s all about public safety, with the implication being that adult sexual predators would enter women s restrooms to prey on people s young daughters.Here s a context in which to view this whole thing. Republicans want to pass an anti-LGBT law that restricts the rights of lawful citizens, because of the actions of potential criminals.When it comes to gun control, Republicans whine constantly about how wrong it is to restrict the rights of lawful citizens, because of the actions of potential criminals. They also say no laws ever stop criminals from doing bad things. It s good to know that the only time restricting rights and preventing crime can happen is when it comes to bathrooms, and not guns.The hypocritical pretzel-twisting that Republicans are having to put themselves into over this issue, and its associated negative consequences, would be hilarious if they were not trying to hurt people in the process.

So much so that YouTube and Trump supporter Paul Ray Ramsey is actually giving the business mogul some advice on how to score points with women and make a comeback.

Duh!Ramsey s disgraceful women-wooing tips were captured by David Futrelle, in which Ramsey praises the Republican front runner for being a  ladies man , but notes that his hateful attitude toward women is hurting him more than helping. Ramsey, who is a white supremacist and nationalist, tried to coach Trump when he said: I know you re a ladies man, your history, but just think about it like when you re meeting girls or trying to seduce them there s a couple of phases. There is the attraction phase which you do well, you re funny, you re not a p*ssy, and girls like that. But if you stay in that assh*le mode too long, you don t get into the comfort stage.And that s where you are now. You need to get into the comfort stage of seduction   of seducing American women and just be nice. In other words, use pick-up artist techniques to simply woo women into supporting team Trump! Nevermind all of the sexist, misogynistic things he s said, or all the attacks Trump has made on women since his campaign started   women will come out to support Trump in droves if only The Donald would turn on his special alpha male charm. Ramsey clearly, deeply believes that American women are that stupid. He continued: I like your edge, I m not saying you should get rid of that, and no one is going to think you re some beta male, but you ve got to add some of that comfort. The only useful   and somewhat reasonable   advice Ramsey gave Trump was to not act  butthurt if you lose  the election. If Trump and his supporters take anything from this idiot s rant, let s hope it s that part.You can listen to the audio below, via We Hunted the Mammoth:It s no wonder Ramsey likes Trump so much, and is so interested in helping the GOPer capture women s votes   he and Trump share the same anti-woman values. Ramsey s disgusting attitude toward women voters goes way back, just like Trump. In 2009, Ramsey was caught promoting white nationalism and saying that women s suffrage was responsible for many of the issues in society. In a blog post from 2010 on a men s rights  site, Ramsey condemned the 1920 extension of voting rights to women. He wrote: Single mothers, rampant divorce, abortion and falling birth rates are part of the cancer that is destroying what is left of Western Civilization. But very few people (even conservatives) fail to realize that the inception of this cancer can be found in the passage of the 19th amendment.

Springsteen joins other big names in the growing boycott against North Carolina. PayPal cancelled their plans to build a massive new operation center in Charlotte. That cost the state 400 skilled jobs.Here is the announcement from Bruce Springsteen.As you, my fans, know I m scheduled to play in Greensboro, North Carolina this Sunday. As we also know, North Carolina has just passed HB2, which the media are referring to as the  bathroom  law. HB2   known officially as the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act   dictates which bathrooms transgender people are permitted to use. Just as important, the law also attacks the rights of LGBT citizens to sue when their human rights are violated in the workplace. No other group of North Carolinians faces such a burden. To my mind, it s an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognizing the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress. Right now, there are many groups, businesses, and individuals in North Carolina working to oppose and overcome these negative developments. Taking all of this into account, I feel that this is a time for me and the band to show solidarity for those freedom fighters. As a result, and with deepest apologies to our dedicated fans in Greensboro, we have canceled our show scheduled for Sunday, April 10th. Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry   which is happening as I write   is one of them. It is the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards.As Springsteen notes, the media has dubbed the right to discriminate law as a the  bathroom law.  While in this case this attack on individual rights is targeted towards LGBT people, it is actually a continuation of the Republican to erode local democracy.  Preemption laws  like HB2 are a strategy conceived by right-wing think tanks that date back to the 1990 s.The idea behind these laws is to prevent grassroots movements from creating progressive change in local cities. That way activists and organizations who do not have the resources to scale their operations to run statewide campaigns are locked out of the equation.While these boycotts are welcomed, HB2 is simply another iteration of a national strategy to destroy local democracy. In order to create a true resistance movement to these laws is to oust the political regimes that are making them. It ll require nothing short of a political revolution. Until that happens, the only thing progressives can do is play a game of political whack-a-mole.Featured image from (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images) ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Mr. Trump has actually done a service as Mr. Cruz is doing a service and that is laying bare, unvarnished some of the nonsense that we have been dealing with in Congress on a daily basis. People act as if these folks are outliers but they are not! We should thank Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz for just being honest that this is how we re thinking these days, or not thinking these days. Obama nailed it. What Cruz and Trump are doing is fighting for the true nature of the Republican Party   right out in the open. Each competes to outdo the other s xenophobia, religious discrimination and hateful rhetoric. Even while Trump is being condemned by some in his party over his language, his closest competitor has repeatedly stated that he too will build a massive concrete wall along the southern border. Both have floated the idea of discriminating against American Muslims based solely on their religion. As the race sinks lower, it s hard to say which is the worse of the two.For that, Americans can get a clear sense of the stakes. The Republican Party is simply not an option if you care about women s rights, LGBT rights, the welfare of the poor, or religious tolerance. Neither candidate has a platform that extends to minorities or young people. Both have very high profile supporters with ties to white supremacy.Which is why, in a serious turn, Obama said it was crucial for voters to oppose whoever gets the Republican nomination.Ds tell @POTUS they will miss him & aren't excited about the 16 race \""And I say, 'I have no patience for that.\""  Juliet Eilperin (@eilperin) April 8, 2016\""I say to folks, 'we cannot be complacent, & we cannot be cynical, because the stakes are too high.'\"" @POTUS  Juliet Eilperin (@eilperin) April 8, 2016Well said, Mr. President.Featured image via Joshua Lott/Getty Images ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In the new video, Trump is praised as a man who  doesn t fear to speak the truth. Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCwXFVhe6DE]Ilias Panagiotaros is a leading member of the party and he s on board with Trump s policies. Penagitaros has praised Hitler for having a  great personality.  Panagiotaros, along with Golden Dawn, has been linked to multiple offenses like murder, aggravated assault, trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering and extortion by the Greek government.Of particular excitement to Panagiotaros is when Trump infamously used a Mussolini quote to describe himself and then defended himself from the outrage, saying,  What difference does it make if it was Mussolini or somebody else,  Trump said.  It s a very good quote. As a result of the Greek economic collapse and the Syrian refugee crisis, Golden Dawn, which has an anti-capitalist platform and is anti-immigration, has gained more of a following. Thus, it should be of no surprise that Donald Trump has some racist fans in the international arena since his platform of denying Muslims entry into the US and building a wall to keep Mexicans out are comparable to that of this organization.The hope is that Donald Trump, along with the creepy Ted Cruz, who is likely even more racist than Trump with his personal brand of xenophobia, will never get to the presidency because if one of these men do, this country and its people are in deep trouble.

The Family Guy creator knows that you can be fervent in your support for a candidate without losing sight of the bigger picture.He said: I actually am one of the people who has been a little disappointed at the way that, not necessarily the campaign, the supporters of the campaign have treated Hillary. I think she s been treated a little harshly by the left. Then making a comparison with those on the right side of the aisle, a party who s lost their damn mind in regards to Trump, a man who they are actually putting forward with all seriousness for president, MacFarlane said: That party has lost some control. This is a guy who is the result of a lot of bigotry gone wild. On the other hand, my side, the left, has gotten a little unreasonable when it comes to separating the trivial from the profound. He added later: The problem is if we don t pick our battles, then we look unreasonable. And I think that s part of where Trump has come from because we have not been able to separate things that are injustices from things that we re just offended by. And it s troubling. MacFarlane seems to know that every ounce of hate thrown at Hillary Clinton is an ounce of ammunition that may be used later. He also knows that when there s no clear distinction between arguments that are serious versus those that are petty and ridiculous, it only serves to hurt the candidate you re trying to support. In essence, many Bernie supporters are actually helping Trump, because they re validating that same sort of rhetoric that is being seen from his supporters as well.At the end of the day, we need to remember that a Democrat needs to win the White House in November.

There are countries at war, there s terrorism, global warming, and we re like,  We should definitely cut the budget for Planned Parenthood.

She also opined that having AIDS was better than having cancer because those afflicted with the politically-correct disease will be getting all of the funding.  As if that weren t bad enough, Bradley topped it all off with an even more disgusting opinion: How sad that the lives of degenerate drug addicts and queers are valued more than the innocent victims of more prevalent ailments.

The DEA currently considers marijuana to be a dangerous drug with no medical benefits and is Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act.That means that marijuana is considered to be as dangerous as heroin. To further drive home how absurd the United States  drug policy is, Methamphetamine is in the Schedule 2 drug category. As far as the DEA is concerned, marijuana is less harmful than crystal meth.Marijuana s current schedule status is a slap in the face to science. At this point, no one can seriously deny the medical benefits marijuana has. Marijuana has already been proven to be an effective treatment for many illnesses, and as a means of managing the side effects of harsher treatments such as chemotherapy. That s why 23 states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes.The U.S. has a major problem with prescription painkillers. Between 1999 and 2014, more than 165,000 have died from overdoses related to prescriptions opioids. Marijuana has not only proven to be an amazing alternative to opioids as a pain management treatment, studies have also shown that marijuana use can help people suffering from opioid addiction.While a decision to reschedule marijuana down from a Schedule 1 controlled substance would help to make it easier for individuals working within the cannabis industry, marijuana advocates say that the rescheduling of marijuana  falls well short  of reflecting the nation s attitude towards the plant.Paul Armentano, the Deputy Director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) wrote a blog post where he said: Reclassifying the pot plant from I to II (or even to schedule III) continues to misrepresent the plant s safety relative to other controlled substances such as methamphetamine (schedule II), anabolic steroids (schedule III), or alcohol (unscheduled), and fails to provide states with the ability to fully regulate it free from federal interference.Further, the federal policies in place that make clinical trial work with cannabis more onerous than it is for other controlled substances   such as the requirement that all source material be purchased from NIDA s University of Mississippi marijuana cultivation program   are regulatory requirements that are specific to cannabis, not to Schedule I drugs in general. Simply rescheduling cannabis from I to II does not necessarily change these regulations, at least in the short-term. So yes, it would be great news for the DEA to reschedule marijuana. It would make federal drug policy one step closer to reflecting reality. However, a plurality of people in the U.S. now wants marijuana to be legal for recreational use. Four states and Washington D.C. have already legalized the sale and use of marijuana for recreational use. Those states have had phenomenal success with their marijuana policies. Now is the time for lawmakers to take bold action to write the wrong that is marijuana prohibition.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images) ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Yet, this seemingly was taken as an attack and Bernie responded in slight, and it kind of goes against his promise to run a clean campaign.Sanders, quite literally said,  I don t believe that she is qualified,  in regards to Clinton. He then went on to list reasons he believes she s not qualified, all of which were just positions he just disagrees with her on, but not a means of disqualification. If anything, Clinton may be the most qualified candidate in modern history, so his remarks were clearly uncalled for.While the internet went into a tizzy slamming Sanders for saying Clinton is unqualified, everyone was waiting for what the Democratic front-runner would say in response.Speaking with reporters Thursday morning, Clinton, being no beginner in receiving uncalled for jabs, shrugged off the attack, saying: Well, it s kind of a silly thing to say. But I m going to trust the voters of New York who know me and have voted for me three times   twice for Senate and once in the presidential primary. Adding: Look, I don t know why he s saying that, but I will take Bernie Sanders over Donald Trump or Ted Cruz any time, so let s keep our eye on what s really at stake in this election. Reiterating that as far as New York is concerned,  that s up to the voters. The voters will decide that. Clinton could have gone negative, but she chose to take the high road and reiterate that if Bernie happens to take the nomination, he s a far better choice than anything the Republicans have to offer. Something Sanders used to say himself about Hillary.This is what every Democrat voting needs to remember, all this bickering back and forth will amount to nothing if a Republican wins in November. Both Hillary and Bernie are FAR better options, and that is clear. Please remember, no matter who, vote blue.Featured Photo by Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""When Mississippi Republicans passed a discriminatory anti-LGBT law, the last thing they expected was backlash from Christians.But that s exactly what is happening.House Bill 1523 or the  Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act,  as Republicans have named it, allows open discrimination by people who claim to have sincerely held religious beliefs against the LGBT community.According to ABC News, the new law does allows the following:  Decline to  solemnize any marriage  or provide wedding-related services based on their religious beliefs or moral convictions. Those services run a full gamut, from wedding planning, photography, disc-jockey services and floral arrangements to cakes, venues and limos.  Decide  whether or not to hire, terminate or discipline an individual whose conduct or religious beliefs are inconsistent  with their beliefs or moral convictions.  Decide to whom they will sell or rent housing they control based on their religious beliefs or moral convictions.  Adoptive or foster parents can raise a child they ve been granted custody of by the state with the same beliefs and convictions of those protected by the law.  Medical and therapy professionals can decline  treatments, counseling, or surgeries related to sex reassignment or gender identity transitioning  and  psychological, counseling, or fertility services  to people whose lifestyles violate their religious beliefs.  People can create  sex-specific standards or policies concerning employee or student dress or grooming, or concerning access to restrooms, spas, baths, showers, dressing rooms, locker rooms or other intimate facilities or settings.  State employees and those acting on behalf of the state may recuse themselves from authorizing or licensing legal marriages, although they may not stand in the way of others doing so.In short, religious bigots can hide behind their bibles and exercise their hatred by denying services to LGBT people or anyone else whom they disagree with, even couples who have pre-marital sex and interracial couples.The law has been roundly condemned across the state and the nation ever since Governor Phil Bryant signed it, with area businesses and national corporations voicing overwhelming opposition.And at least one Christian business owner is adding to the backlash.Mitchell Moore is a Republican who owns Campbell s Bakery located in the state capital of Jackson, Mississippi, and during an interview with NPR, Moore ripped GOP lawmakers a new one for passing a stupid law that has nothing to do with Christian values. I am here to bake cakes and to sell those cakes,  Moore declared.  I m not here to decide arbitrarily who deserves my cake and who doesn t. That s not what I do. That s not my job. Moore then went on to lambaste Republicans for focusing on a non-existent problem while ignoring the real problems Mississippi faces. So leaving aside the stupidity of passing it because it decriminalizes discrimination   which, that really is kind of the biggest issue   but I can actually say I think the law of unintended consequences is going to come back to bite the people who signed this bill. If it is my sincerely held religious belief that I shouldn t serve them, then I can do that. And I can hide behind that language. But that language is so vague it opens a Pandora s box. And you can t shut it again. There is no sincerely held religious belief to think that I am better than other people   to think that my sin is different than other people. And so I am a deeply Christian man, and those go counter to my belief system.The assumption that they think that they re looking out for us   that s not what they are doing. We rank number one   our state government is the most dependent on federal money. We are the third most obese state. We rank at the bottom in unemployment, in education. We ve got crumbling infrastructure. None of them are being tackled. Instead, we are passing, hey-let s-discriminate bills. Here s the audio via NPR.Republicans in Mississippi are seriously in trouble if even Christians are pissed off at them for passing this law, which by the way, could not only cost the state millions of dollars in business, it could cost them them millions in federal tax dollars not to mention the millions of dollars the state will have to use when the lawsuits begin to be filed. So just like in North Carolina, Republicans in Mississippi have chosen to make their state an even crappier place to live by shoving Christian Sharia law down everyone s throats.Featured Image: Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""New York Daily News stooped incredibly low on April 6, by running a cover story using parts of an interview Bernie Sanders had with the paper s editorial board out of context to attack him.Despite their interview never mentioning Sandy Hook, the article, featuring two Connecticut Hillary Clinton supporters, attacked Bernie Sanders over a false assumption he is against gun manufacturers being sued.In the interview Senator Sanders outlined his gun control agenda, comparing it to President Obama s. When asked whether gun manufacturers should be susceptible to lawsuits (not should they receive immunity), Bernie Sanders said  no   while his explanation was largely omitted. In the same sense that if you re a gun dealer and you sell me a gun and I go out and I kill him [gestures to someone in room]. Do I think that that gun dealer should be sued for selling me a legal product that he misused? [Shakes head no.] But I do believe that gun manufacturers and gun dealers should be able to be sued when they should know that guns are going into the hands of wrong people,  said Senator Sanders.  So if somebody walks in and says,  I d like 10,000 rounds of ammunition,  you know, well, you might be suspicious about that. So I think there are grounds for those suits, but not if you sell me a legal product. Bernie Sanders went on to add he has a D-minus rating from the NRA and lost an election in 1988 by three points against an opponent who was backed by the NRA. Trying to lie and portray Bernie Sanders as an NRA-backed candidate is preposterous, especially while Hillary Clinton has a former NRA lobbyist, Jeff Forbes, co-hosting fundraisers for her.Gun control is a hot issue among Democrats, and the mainstream media is misrepresenting Bernie Sanders  record to favor Hillary Clinton when their agendas are virtually identical, but rather than sensationalize and further divide people on the issue, Bernie Sanders emphasizes prevention.Lawsuits are not meant to replace or make up for ground where legislation or laws have yet to be enacted. If any dealer or manufacturer acts within the confines of the law, they can t be held accountable in a lawsuit, whether it is guns or any other product.Other parts of the NY Daily News interview have been taken out of context and manipulated by mainstream media. CNN was recently called out for making it seem as though Bernie Sanders was confused about how he would break up the big banks. He wasn t and isn t. On CNN, Nomiki Konst corrected an uninformed CNN anchor on what Bernie Sanders said. Well actually, you know, there s great fact checking done on this in the New York Times, which I hold as a higher standard of a paper  I think most New Yorkers hold the Times a little bit higher than the Daily News and New York Post. But they fact checked this and they basically said that he was right on this. You know the point if you read the entire transcript, which is very long, took about 45 minutes to read. He went into detail about how the determination of how to break up the big banks lies within Congress or the president, and the president gives authority to the Fed.The problem is that we take, as we do in the media, take little bits out of context and don t show the full picture. And to be clear, to be even more fair, Bernie Sanders is the only Senator who brought this up in Congress  And you know what? The Daily News didn t talk about that, but the New York Times did. The mainstream media needs to stop taking the New York Daily News interview out of context to suit its agenda in trying to stop the surging Bernie Sanders.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Glenn Grothman openly bragged that the voter ID he helped pass in his state would hurt Hillary Clinton in the general election. Hillary Clinton is about the weakest candidate the Democrats have ever put up and now we have voter ID and I think voter ID is going to make a little bit of a difference as well,  he said on national television as the law caused long delays and forced voters to wait in long lines. You re not supposed to say that out loud,  Meyers responded.  That s like a dude rolling up in a Corvette and saying,  You know, I bought this to compensate for my tiny penis. Meyers then moved on to North Carolina, where a sweeping GOP-passed anti-voting law has caused poll workers to make voting difficult for people who aren t white. During the North Carolina primary in March, poll workers forced an Asian couple to spell their names and made them wait to exercise their voting rights as white voters were allowed to breeze through the lines without a problem. Critics had warned in 2013 that the voter ID law would bring back Jim Crow era tactics, and it looks like they were right. That s terrible news for the nation s Kaileys,  Meyers quipped.  So many ways you can go, Kayleigh. This is America   the only time you should have to spell your own name is when you re screaming it on a call with Time Warner Cable. Then Meyers took aim at Arizona, where the worst voting fiasco has taken place thus far this year.Arizona Republicans slashed the number of polling places from 400 to 200 in 2012, which led to thousands of citizens waiting in line to vote for hours. Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell went ahead and cut that down to 60 just this year, resulting in an even longer wait to cast votes in a county with a population of four million. But that s not all. Misinformation was spread via the Secretary of State s website and hundreds of voters, mostly Democrats, had their party affiliation altered prior to the primary. Even Secretary of States Michele Reagan testified that election fraud occurred and Arizonans are calling for a federal investigation. If you ve been waiting in line so long the pizza place is willing to deliver to you, you re going to be frustrated,  Meyers remarked.  Is that a house or an apartment?   It s a line   I live in a line. Meyers ended the segment by pointing out that these voter ID laws could end up repeating the 2000 Election. You know, the nightmare election that forced George W. Bush upon America because the conservative-leaning Supreme Court stepped in to halt a recount that could have resulted in an Al Gore victory. And we all know what happened over the next eight years.Yeah, let s not do that again.Here s the video via YouTube: Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Now, we finally get to hear what he had to say about the woman who prevented him from getting his latte and it is absolutely baffling.In the viral video, Cara Jennings yelled (in part), You don t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here,  at the governor.She s not wrong, Scott has done many, many horrible things to the people of his state. He refused to expand Medicaid to nearly a million of the state s working poor. He changed hospital rules for one of his donors who ran a medical center with an extremely high infant mortality rate.  He has attacked women at every turn, most recently with an unconstitutional anti-abortion bill.On Wednesday, Governor Scott s office issued a statement saying: People with radical views tend to not like civil debate. A self-proclaimed anarchist rudely yelled and cursed at the Governor. She also refused to Pledge Allegiance to the flag. It s a free country, but it s not at all surprising that an anarchist prefers shouting over conversation. What? That s his response? Jennings didn t stand for the Pledge, seriously?Jennings, a former Lake Worth city commissioner, was asked what she thinks of Scott s bizarre allegations and she said that sometimes she recited it, sometimes she didn t: I was never disrespectful about it, but I was never an avid Pledge leader,  she said. But I don t know how that bears any impact on if I critique his policies or not. How is it relevant if I say the Pledge? It has absolutely nothing to do with her critiques of his policies, but he is doing what Republicans often do when confronted: he s deflecting. Scott is not the kind of guy who feels like he should ever have to answer for anything he does. A prime example of this was when his former company Columbia/HCA defrauded the federal government out of millions of dollars with the biggest Medicare fraud in history and when he was asked about it, he invoked the 5th Amendment 75 times.So, his current deflection is, really, just more of the same from Florida s biggest mistake.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They came with hopes for a better life, to a place where big dreams are encouraged because with hard work, and determination, those dreams can come true in New York. These big dreams are emblematic of Bernie Sanders  campaign message. Throughout his political career, he has demonstrated the honesty, integrity and work ethic required to turn ideas into reality. The story of a lower-middle class Jewish Brooklyn kid becoming mayor of a city in Vermont by ten votes after rigorous grassroots organizing, defying the odds stacked against him by getting elected to congress as an Independent, and managing to serve there for over 25 years shows the kind of tenacity that makes New Yorkers stand apart. New York is where the most ambitious and driven go to change the world, and that s what Bernie Sanders  campaign is looking to do, not just continue with the status quo. New Yorkers are people who dared to take a risk or do whatever it takes to see their dreams come true. People still come to New York with the New York State of Mind,  if they can make it here they can make it anywhere. Bernie Sanders  campaign has grown from a point where most Americans had never heard of him to millions of Americans participating in the political process, many for the first time, through working with one another and talking to one another about the issues Bernie Sanders has been addressing. Rather than rely on wealthy corporate donors or the mainstream media to spread the message of the campaign, Bernie Sanders has relied on everyday Americans and their resiliency to keep fighting despite the odds stacked against them by the establishment. Popular consensus thought it was unrealistic to think Bernie Sanders could ever challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, but his campaign has overcome the adversity of those notions and is transforming the country s political landscape.New Yorkers know all about resiliency and coming together in the face of adversity. After the terrorist attacks on 9/11, New York led the way in bringing Americans together, helping to rebuild what was lost, banding together to move forward to a better, safer future. New Yorkers showed the world their resiliency once again in response to Hurricane Sandy, when New Yorkers who still had electricity and water unabated, lent a helping hand to their neighbors.In a world where violence and tragedy are covered daily in mainstream media, New Yorkers have shown the world time and again good prevails against evil. In 2010, New Yorker s stories began to be encapsulated by the Humans of New York project, cataloging the diversity and beauty of New Yorkers for the world to see. It s known as the greatest city in the world because of its history, diversity, and character, which all attest to the greatest achievements of mankind.Many of the nation s historic battles with the labor movement took place in New York. Samuel Gompers, a New York native, was the American Federation of Labor s first president, called New York City,  the cradle of the American Labor Movement.  That labor movement brought America the 40-hour work week, and drastically improved working conditions and labor laws. Today in New York, labor unions maintain more membership and power than any other state in the country. No other presidential candidate has been fighting for workers  rights to the extent Bernie Sanders has.In October 2015, Bernie Sanders was the only candidate who took time off from campaigning to join a picket line with Verizon workers and union members in New York City who were fighting for a fair contract and to have an employee who was fired for leading an organizing campaign reinstated. He is the only presidential candidate who supports a $15 minimum wage, and only his economic policies go far enough to help rebuild the working and middle classes in this country. The average American has not had an increase in pay in 15 years, but things have cost more in the marketplaces. He has been in a recession for 15 years, nothing has changed for him. Up at the top, we re not in a recession, but 80 percent of the Americans have been in a recession for at least 15 years,  said New York native and Godfather of Wall Street, Asher Edelman, in an interview on CNBC Fast Money.Edelman endorsed Bernie Sanders on the show: If you look at something called velocity of money, that means how much gets spent and turns around,  he said.  When you have the top 1 percent getting money, they spend five to ten percent of what they earn, when you have the lower end of the economy they spend 100 or 110 percent of what they earn. As you ve had a transfer of wealth and income to the top, you have a shrinking consumer base basically and a shrinking velocity of money. Bernie is the only person out there who I think is talking at all about both fiscal stimulation and banking rules that will get the banks to generate lending again as opposed to speculation, so from an economic point its straight forward. Bernie Sanders campaign is what New York is all about. New York is dubbed the  Empire State  not because of its millionaires, billionaires, and corporations, but because its wealth lies in its diversity, character, ambition, and resources which are all quintessentially American.Bernie Sanders  popularity has manifested in the form of record attendances at his campaign rallies and an overtaking of the internet by his supporters because his campaign has that same addictive energy as New York. The people are what are driving Bernie Sanders campaign, and the people are what make New York so great. Hard working Americans have been devoting both contributions and their free time to the campaign because the ideology behind Bernie Sanders  campaign is a future Americans can believe in, and millions of Americans are willing to put in the work to achieve it.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He has several times expressed the desire to launch a trade war with the country, despite economists warning it could hurl the world back into a global recession, and possibly lead to something approaching armed conflict. Experts don t know whether to laugh or cry. I think in order to qualify as a coherent set of policies, the policies have to not be cartoonish and the policies have to stand some chance of being actually enacted, and I just don t think Mr. Trump s trade policies meet either of those criteria,  said Michael Strain, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.But while spiraling the world into economic ruin, Trump will no doubt continue to have personal business dealings with Chinese factories. After all, he s made a lot of money by paying Chinese workers next to nothing to manufacture cheapo clothing he can sell in American stores. His entire business model depends on it.This recall is a reminder that Trump s fans are getting what they pay for.

It seems that the more visibility that the transgender community gets, the more energy Republican legislators put into proposing anti-transgender bills to police what bathrooms they can and can t use.To try to understand exactly why this is, Williams spoke to several trans people and one of their biggest opponents, Chaplain and state Rep. Gordon Klingenschmitt (R-CO). Williams confronted the transphobic lawmaker about his belief that transgender people are merely  confused,  and completely destroyed him. In expressing his asinine and twisted religious beliefs, Klingenschmitt told Williams just why transgender people were such a threat to the rest of the country: They not only want to be confused about their own identity, but they want the rest of us to be confused with them. Now they want the government to join them on that pretense? They re making us into liars. Interesting   because when Williams actually asked trans people what they wanted, all they said was respect. They weren t trying to  confuse  or trick anyone about their identity, and insisted that their gender identity was not actually a choice (research can confirm this).Klingenschmitt wanted to go more into the discussion of religion, but insisted on changing first. He said: I would be comfortable talking about religious freedom, but I have to change into my alter ego. Williams waited for him  to transition so he would feel more comfortable during our interview,  while Klingenschmitt remained completely clueless to how ironic the situation had become.When Williams questioned Klingenschmitt about why he was so passionate about passing transphobic legislation, he replied: I mean, that is perversion. It s people who label themselves as transgender for the purpose of getting that access to violate the rights of others. Williams then targeted his role as a chaplain and asked him,  Is it fair to say that if you re a priest you re a pedophile?  Klingenschmitt said no, and Williams asked him why. He replied: Because some people are criminals, and some people are not criminals. Klingenschmitt then said he was unable to apply that same logic to the trans community because  they re apples and oranges. Williams was able to gather that Klingenschmitt s concern was that policies allowing trans women to use bathrooms that match their gender identity would result in sexual assault   even though there have literally been NO reported instances where sexual assault has happened as a result of this.You can watch her dismantle the GOP s anti-trans panic below:The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Get More: The Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,The Daily Show Video Archive Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

O Reilly starts with Trump s response to losing to Ted Cruz in Wisconsin, which for those who missed it, was to issue an aggressive statement denouncing  Lyin Ted : Last night after losing Wisconsin, Trump issued a statement calling Ted Cruz names. Not Presidential. Not a smart move.Seems the Trump campaign is confused.We were hoping the candidate would appear on the Factor this evening, we negotiated with his team for days. But he declined.That of course, is his prerogative. Apparently there is angst in the Trump campaign because Charles Krauthammer sometimes hammers Trump on the Factor. So that s what has driven the Trump Campaign into a frenzy. Like any playground battle amongst toddlers, it is all about who is hanging out with whom. O Reilly is known to have Pulitzer prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer on his show fairly frequently, but Krauthammer hates Donald trump, which means the Trump campaign hates Charles Krauthammer and everyone is now throwing sand in each other s faces.And just to reassure you: if this all sounds like the sort of immature behavior that is demeaning to the office for which Donald Trump is running, you re right   it is. But this is the gutter into which the Republican party has dragged itself in recent years, and where it may well die in its own juices.In a week where Greg Gutfeld and Megyn Kelly gave powerful denunciations of Donald Trump and their colleagues who soft pedal interviews and debates with him, O Reilly stepped up with some home truths of his own. The veteran host made it absolutely clear that his team would not be intimidated by the schoolyard bully tactics of the Trump campaign, drawing a clear line in the sand. We have been very fair very fair to Donald Trump on this program, but that does not mean we ll not criticize him or cancel guests who have a dim view of him. O Reilly goes on to demand the Trump campaign  stop the nonsense  and learn to answer fair questions directly, because it will be the only way he gain the support to win. His current level of support  not nearly enough to secure him the White House. Ouch. It seems the Trump campaign is busy alienating every friend it ever made, by demanding an exclusivity of pro-Trump content  or else.

Felony charges were brought against Blankenship and, unbelievably, he was convicted of deliberately violating the safety measures that led to 29 deaths. It was a shocking verdict even though the jury inexplicably acquitted him of the more serious charges.But today, it s back to business as usual as Blankenship was sentenced to a whole whopping year in jail and fined $250,000. That s 12 days and $8,620 for each life he stole away from the families and loved ones of the victims. That s what human life is worth these days, apparently.Oh, and he s completely unrepentant:Mr. Blankenship said,  My main point is wanting to express sorrow to the families and everyone for what happened.  As he spoke, relatives of dead miners cried in the courtroom s gallery, and one wiped her face with a crumpled piece of paper.Mr. Blankenship, however, was also defiant and told Judge Berger,  It s important to me that everyone knows that I am not guilty of a crime.

If Donald Trump was running for state legislature in the year 2060 after Roe v. Wade was overturned and happens to be in a place that will pass those laws, that s a relevant question,  she said.But then Coulter went off the rails completely by claiming that Hispanic immigrants are rapists who are responsible for the number of women who need abortion services. The solution, Coulter insisted, is Trump s proposed wall between Mexico and the United States. I think I d be a lot more upset that women are going to get a lot more abortions if we don t close our border with Mexico and bring in all of Latin American rape culture. Coulter went on to claim that Trump is the guy to vote for if women want a president who will protect them.Here s the video via YouTube.First off, if women want a candidate who has their best interests at heart, Donald Trump is most certainly not the candidate they should support. Trump has already suggested punishing women who seek an abortion, which alone should be enough to prove that he doesn t give a damn about women.Furthermore, Coulter repeated Trump s racist accusation that all Hispanic immigrants are rapists, only she added to it by claiming that they re responsible for women needing abortions.In short, Republicans should be scared to death because their front-runner has just pissed off both Hispanics and women like no candidate has ever done before. Even Ted Cruz has waded into the abortion debate by telling Fox host Megyn Kelly that he wants to force rape victims to carry their rapist s baby to term instead of giving them access to abortion. So Cruz is no better than Trump when it comes down to it.The bottom line is that this is by far the most despicable remark made by Trump or one of his supporters during this election cycle and it should cost the GOP dearly in November.

The only  freedom  it grants is for religious zealots to legally discriminate and fire people for being gay, as well as turn them away from their businesses, very reminiscent of Jim Crow era laws.Knowing how horrific these sort of laws are, and being on the receiving end of being fired for being gay, Ellen DeGeneres took a moment on her show to talk about the new Mississippi law. She said she s  not a political person,  but stated  when I see something wrong, I have to talk about it,  so she did.Ellen said of the law: It s the very definition of discrimination. It s also something that the Supreme Court already ruled on when they made marriage a right for everyone, everyone. Then jokingly added: They re Supreme. I mean, that s the best you can get. Like the Nacho Supreme from Taco Bell. However, she took a very serious tone talking about her own experiences being discriminated against, but coming out on top in the end. If you re in Mississippi or North Carolina or anywhere and you re saddened by the fact that people are judging you based on who you love, don t lose hope. I was fired for being gay, and I know what it feels like. I lost everything. But look at me now. The crowd then erupts into cheers, with Ellen perfectly adding: I could buy that governor s mansion, flip it, and make a $7 million dollar profit. But really driving home the point that what we really, truly need in this world is  less hate and more love. And she couldn t be more right.Thank you, Ellen. You re spot-on as usual, and hopefully Mississippi takes notice.Watch the segment here: Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Joshua Kehm is a uniformed police officer working for the San Antonio Independent School District at Rhodes Middle School.The incident happened on March 29, and was captured by a student on her cell phone.In the video, a uniformed officer is seen struggling with a girl, then slamming her to the ground. The officer appears to handcuff the girl before having her stand and leading her away.Gloria Valdez, the 12-year-old girl s mother, told CBS affiliate KENS it was completely uncalled for. Supposedly he was threatened by her that she kicked him, but in the video her legs never went up,  Valdez said.Valdez s daughter did not want to go on camera but told KENS that she was having a conversation with another girl when a crowd surrounded them. She said that s when the officer put his hands on her.The mother told a local TV station that the slam was so vicious that her daughter lost consciousness, and doesn t remember being handcuffed by the cop. She also reportedly has bruises from the confrontation.The school district has suspended the officer, and a spokesperson told the TV station,  we are not going to tolerate excessive force in our district. The video is the latest in an unsettling series of videos, often recorded by students themselves, showing police officers using what appears to be excessive force to subdue children. The videos, which have often gone viral on YouTube and other social media, have helped to create a backlash against so-called  zero tolerance  policies that became popular in the early to mid-1990s.At the same time, rather than admit that the videos show a disturbing pattern, some police unions and conservative politicians have supported legislation that criminalizes recording police, rather than assessing the obvious problem of poor police training and behavior.Featured image via YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Someone that wants to get the job done?Weaver said: Don t destroy the Democratic Party to satisfy the secretary s ambitions to become president of the United States.

They said: I think it s about time we had a female president of the United States. I don t care what anyone says: Women can be just as smart and qualified as men especially the clowns we ve had in Washington lately. But Hillary Clinton? She s just a little too ambitious to do what no woman before her has ever done.Hillary seems to think she knows what our country needs better than anyone else, and believes that she, among the hundreds or thousands of qualified politicians, is the only one who can do it. Is that really the sort of person we want at the helm of our federal government? Also saying: Hillary doesn t shy away from tough situations, as she proved with her health- care proposal during her husband s first term. She likes to tackle the hard problems, no matter how entrenched the current failing system seems to be. Is it just me, or should the woman who  overturns a 230-year-old tradition not have such a tendency to rock the boat?Hillary has some very strong opinions, and she certainly doesn t hesitate to voice them. She s got an entire website dedicated to her positions on every last little thing. In debates, she always wants to have the last word. She s in love with the sound of her own voice. That s not the sort of person who should be in politics, much less the White House.Do we really want the first woman leading the free world to be such an outright take-charge type? Basically saying everything that every man has ever done who s ever run for office, but you know, since it s Hillary, well then she s  too ambitious. Now, let it be known that Weaver is not Sanders, and Sanders did not say this. However, this sort of talk doesn t make the candidate look good and should likely be reined in a tad.

Rick Snyder and several of his staffers were just served notice that they were being sued for a  pattern of racketeering activity. The lawsuit stems from a group of 15 Flint residents who saw the lack of action being taken at the criminal level and decided to seek damages at the civil one. Snyder now faces a RICO suit, the same typically used to take down corporations committing fraud and organized crime done by mobsters. Ironically, it s Snyder s conservative philosophy of treating his governance like running a business that may be his undoing. He wants to run the state like a business,  attorney Marc J. Bern said of Snyder.  Well. The citizens of Flint, as shareholders in the corporation of the state of Michigan, I don t think they were treated in an appropriate way. The lawsuit alleges that officials misrepresented the suitability of the Flint River water as the city s drinking water source for roughly two years and billed Flint residents at rates that were the highest in the nation for water that was unusable, resulting in the city s budget deficit being reversed.At first blush, using the RICO act, to go after a sitting governor seems like a stretch, but Snyder has always stressed how he hated government and considered himself more of a facilitator of private industry. To prove it, one of his first acts after being elected in 2010 was to give enormous tax breaks to his rich friends. In that light, proving greed-motivated gross negligence, and potentially willful deception, at the hands of Snyder s administration shouldn t be very difficult. Through emails, it s clear that both Snyder and the people who worked for him were very aware of problems with Flint s water. At the same time, the group made very little attempt to hide the fact that they hoped skimping on Flint s water safety would save them a few bucks in the long run. It was all part of that business-first mindset that Snyder trumpeted during election years.As The Washington Post put it:Snyder, a former accountant and venture capitalist whose Twitter handle is @onetoughnerd, took office in 2011 promising to fix the state s many financial problems by applying the expertise of outsiders who could reinvent the way government works. In Flint, where poverty had deepened after the departure of much of the auto industry, he appointed a series of emergency managers whose authority superseded even that of the elected city council.With his unelected cronies in place, Snyder focused on profit margins rather than the welfare of his state s residents. And to absolutely nobody s shock, the plan came back to backfire   hurting Michigan s most vulnerable. Now he s being accused of the same crimes that took down the mafia. Should Snyder ever wind up behind bars, it s likely he would fit right in.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Sure, I m excited for the possibility of the first-ever female president, but in all honesty, it comes down to experience and ability to get the job done, which she has done time and time again throughout her career.Being tired of this question being posed, and having a decent size Facebook audience to deliver my message, I took to my page to lay out my answer once and for all.Here s my response: I can t tell you how many times I ve been asked,  are you voting for Hillary because she s a woman?  Well, to that I have to say,  no,  but if you re going ask, with that criteria, if I m voting for Hillary just because she s a woman, well, I m going to assume you re not voting for her just because she s a woman. And if you use the same attacks that Republicans have been using against her for decades, well, that means you re really no better than a Republican. And if you use her voting record against her, but then willfully ignore Bernie s anti-gun reform votes   well, sorry, you re a hypocrite. And if Hillary is the nominee this November and you refuse to vote for a Democrat or you refuse to vote, you might as well be voting for a Republican. As far as experience, don t even go there. She s clearly the most qualified person for the job. So no, I m not voting for Hillary because she s a woman. I m voting for her because she s the best damn person for the job. However, how revolutionary would it be to finally have the first woman president? It s pretty badass. And as I was going to keep this solely to my page it became apparent when Hillary was accused of ruining the Democratic party with her ambition, that this really needed to be seen again, because that is a ridiculously sexist remark. I mean, how dare a woman have the audacity to be ambitious enough to seek the White House. Is that ever asked of men? Is it? No, it s not.So no, I m not voting for Hillary because she s a woman, but I sure as hell am voting for a woman with ambition and the go-get-it attitude that she has displayed throughout her entire career. But let it be known, that if she s not the nominee for any reason, I will vote blue no matter who, because I m able to be an adult and realize the needs of the country are far more important than just the needs of my ideal candidate winning, and if a Republican wins, we all lose. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ <span>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3\"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;I can t begin to tell you how many times I ve been asked by Bernie supporters if I m voting for Hillary  just because she s a woman,  so, to make things easier, here s my response.Posted by Opinionated Democrat on Tuesday, February 9, 2016Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I m proud of what we created and I m proud to be a part of a conversation that is pushing things forward in a positive way. And she is absolutely correct. Police brutality and injustice are very real, and need to be talked about as part of the national conversation. Nothing is going to change if we ignore the problem and submit to the status quo. Far too many people of color are being gunned down in the streets, or taken into custody for literally no good reason, but rather for just existing while black, and several people have actually died in custody. It s not okay. It s never okay. And it needs to be discussed.Good on Beyonc  for speaking up, speaking her mind, and not backing down.

Well, I think that she s got a lot of Marla, she s a really beautiful baby, and she s, uh, she s got Marla s legs. We don t know whether or not she s got this part yet,  Trump said regarding his wife s chest,  but time will tell. His wife at the time nervously laughed at Donald Trump s inappropriate comment.The Daily Show aired this clip in a line with several other overtly sexist comments Donald Trump has made about women. In addition to his abrasive relationship with Fox News Host Megyn Kelly, the current Republican front runner for the presidential nomination has criticized former Republican candidate Carly Fiorina for her looks, condescendingly belittled other reporters, made sexist remarks towards Hillary Clinton, Arianna Huffington Heidi Klum, his ex-wives, women on his TV show, Celebrity Apprentice, and countless others.In 2013, he tweeted that women should expect sexual assault in the military, and wrote in a book published in 2006 women are basically objects meant to look good. Beauty and elegance, whether in a woman, a building, or a work of art, is not just superficial or something pretty to see,  he wrote.Donald Trump s record of overt sexism is endless and spans his entire life in the public eye. He can t seem to get through an interview without making some sort of sexist remark or conclusion, and the scariest part is millions of his supporters agree and applaud every single word he says. The fight for gender equality still has many obstacles to overcome and the condoning of Donald Trump s behavior by his supporters and those in the media who don t bother to acknowledge and criticize it bring those obstacles out into the open for the public to see. As feminists, which every Democrat should consider themselves to be, we need to ensure sexism isn t dismissed or neglected as acceptable or commonplace, rather these sexists, especially ones with such a platform as Donald Trump, need to be engaged and held accountable for their remarks.Featured image courtesy of Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Yet, despite the fact that Trump has truly shown the ugly side of America, there s also a wonderful and inspiring side, with great values that are inherent in a great people.That was all on display in a powerful message that New York voters, who will be going to the polls on April 19th, sent to Donald Trump, America, and the world.

In the column entitled  Let s raise our voices against this dictator, Donald Trump, Fox wrote: Trump has said Mexicans are the problem, calling us rapists and criminals. He thinks building the  Trump Wall  will right every wrong in the United States. Indeed, he s built a huge mental wall around himself already, which doesn t allow him to see the greatness of our people.Despite that, I want to thank him for his racist and ignorant ideas. Thanks to them, Mexico is in the global spotlight; every day, more and more people inside and outside the United States are realizing the decent way Mexicans live their lives. Fox then gave some amazing examples about how Trump s hate speech has actually helped to elevate the success of the Mexicans Trump spends so much time insulting: This year, a Mexican cinematographer won his third Academy Award in a row. In science and technology, a number of young and bright Mexicans won the International Robotics Tournament in 2015. And in Silicon Valley, one of the key advisers during the creation of Google was a Mexican professor: Hector Garc a Molina. Fox went further and condemned Trump s hateful rhetoric as a  lose-lose  proposition, stating that isolating immigrants will only hurt America, as they have already contributed so much to this country   something that Trump conveniently ignores whenever he s in anti-immigrant mode (even though he himself has relied on many immigrants to run his businesses and properties). Fox said: He says that he ll make America great again, but I believe he s only making it worse. America is already great, largely thanks to the hard work and perseverance of immigrants from all over the world who made it their home. Did you know that 40% of the Fortune 500 companies in the United States have been founded by immigrants? You can read the entire scathing message to Trump here.It s honestly always a pleasure whenever Fox attacks Trump   he never disappoints.

Speaking with a reporter at Serb Hall, where Cruz delivered his victory speech, Rep. Glenn Grothman said he was very confident about his party s chances in November because they have voter ID laws as the ace up their sleeve.For those wondering why this is a big deal, please remember that Republicans have repeatedly tried to keep this obvious fact under the radar. Thanks to Grothman the bell has been rung. The genie is out of the bottle. Republicans are using racist and discriminatory laws of their own design to keep Democrats away from the polls as a pillar of their election strategy.When asked about a Republican nominee s chances in a general election, Grothman didn t hesitate to give credit where it was due: His party s efforts to make it harder to vote. Well, I think Hillary Clinton is about the weakest candidate the Democrats have ever put up and now we have photo ID. I think photo ID is going to a little bit of a difference as well. This confirms what many political observers have been saying all along. The Republicans who push for stronger voter ID laws under the pretext to stop (nonexistent) voter fraud are using it as a cudgel to strongarm Democratic voters out of the voting booths. Given the fact that these laws almost invariably affect poor, often minority voters, this means two things: Democrats are being prevented for voting for the candidates who they would like to, and Republicans can continue to ignore the plight of the poor because they have been systematically disenfranchised.It s particularly unsurprising that a state run by a guy like Gov. Scott Walker (R) would have lawmakers actively salivating about disenfranchising people. His administration has never been one to dwell on actual democracy. A deeply unpopular governor, Walker managed to escape a strong impeachment effort by flooding his recall opposition campaign warchest with out-of-state dollars from conservative groups. It s Walker s administration which has been the most passionate about getting Voter ID laws in place: Their jobs literally depend on it.Thanks to Rep.

There are a few legitimate reasons (childbirth/child rearing) but a lot more illegitimate ones (women aren t as hard working/they re too emotional/not as smart). But another, more fundamental, reason has been identified by two researchers:According to Travis Wiseman, director of the International Business program at Mississippi State University, and Nabamita Dutta of the University of Wisconsin, researchers have largely ignored the cultural factors that shape gender roles in the workplace. As the two researchers note in a recent working paper, there has been little attention given to one cultural factor in particular: religiosity.Yes, it s our old friend religion that s contributed to racism, anti-LGBT bigotry and bucket-loads of misogyny. Now it s helping suppress economic opportunities for women. It seems like this would be obvious but apparently it wasn t:To test that variable, Wiseman and Dutta looked at how two different measurements of religiosity among residents of different states   belief in God and participation in religious activity   correlated with the gender wage-gap in those states. Even after controlling for age, education, marital status, occupation, time in the workforce, and other factors, they found that this correlation was rather significant: specifically, that a three percent increase in a state s religiosity related to a one percent increase in its gender wage-gap.So what s happening here? The study doesn t draw any conclusions beyond the correlation but it s not hard to guess.In the view of most of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), women are not meant to work outside of the home, much less be the primary earner. This definitely applies to conservative religion but it s not exclusively relegated to the right. Even if left leaning employers don t realize it, they ve been conditioned, to a degree, to view women as the caregiver in a family:Traditional religious attitudes might also affect employer behavior, shaping managers  decisions about whom to hire or lay off, or a family s decision about who should be the primary breadwinner. Zooming out, the state government s distribution of resources   like education, health care, and parental leave   can also be shaped by prevailing cultural norms that are shaped by religious attitudes. Cultural norms  is the key phrase there. Until we break the social model that men are the natural breadwinners and women are the natural diaper changers, it s going to be nigh-impossible to get people to stop discriminating against women (even unconsciously) in the workplace.Featured image via Getty""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They found that fully half thought at least one of the false statements presented was possibly, probably or definitely true.Moreover, those who held false beliefs often rated black patients  pain as lower than that of white patients and made less appropriate recommendations about how they should be treated.If this sounds insane to you, remember that the police regularly pump unarmed black men full of bullets because they literally believe that black people are inhumanly strong and resistant to pain.

They don t give black people nearly as much pain medication:A 2000 study out of Emory University found that at a hospital emergency department in Atlanta, 74 percent of white patients with bone fractures received painkillers compared with 50 percent of black patients. Similarly, a paper last year found that black children with appendicitis were less likely to receive pain medication than their white counterparts.If you ll recall, the over-prescription of painkillers to white people is the direct cause of the drug epidemic assaulting white communities. White people have been getting hooked on pain killers and when their doctors finally cut them off (if they ever do), they turn to the next closest thing: Heroin. And it spirals out of control from there.By being racist jerks that allow black people to suffer pain in the short term, the medical community has spared them the long term pain of addiction. At last, systemic racism finally did something positive for the black community. Hooray. Aren t you just so proud of AmeriKKKa now?Featured image via vine18.com""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

She often speaks passionately about ideas she feels very strongly about, but she rarely gets visibly pissed off. However, one particular Republican stooge managed to accomplish that feat, as you will see in the video below.Senator Warren was speaking during a hearing that was intended to discuss covering the  costs  to banks if they were regulated, in an effort to prevent them from completely imploding the American economy again. Republicans produced a  star witness, Leonard Chanin, who is one of the people most responsible for the 2008 financial crisis, to testify that banks should not have regulations places on them. As you may have already figured out, that was a bad idea. Senator Warren pointed out how his personal inaction, as well as that of the rest of the Federal Reserve, basically guaranteed a financial crisis.Mr. Chanin, as Sen. Brown mentioned from 2005 to 2011 you held top positions in the Federal Reserve s division of consumer and community affairs, and in those positions you had both the legal authority and the legal responsibility to regulate deceptive mortgages, including dangerous subprime lending that sparked the 2008 financial crisis. But you didn t do it, despite years of calls and even begging from consumer advocates and others asking you to act. Instead, you did essentially nothing.According to the Dallas Fed, that crisis cost the American economy an estimated $14 trillion. It cost millions of families their homes, their jobs, their savings. It devastated communities across America.Republicans simply do not give a sh*t about how much it costs regular Americans to allow banks to literally rob the entire middle class of everything they own. This was a point that was slammed directly in the face of Chanin.So when you talk now about how certain regulations are too costly or too difficult to comply with, you sound a lot like you did before the 2008 crisis when you failed to act. So my question is, given your track record at the Fed, why should anyone take you seriously now.As if the severe embarrassment that she just laid on him personally was not enough, Chanin went on to try to lie to Senator Warren s face, followed by refusing to answer even the most basic questions from her afterwards. That s when it all went wrong for the Republicans  star witness.

While discussing the details of the Republican convention delegates, Priebus   possibly without realizing it   heavily implied something many have been suspecting: the fact that the Republican party will try to steal the nomination from Donald Trump.Priebus was attempting to explain the process of how Republican delegates work, and seemed to be justifying the concept of them not voting to represent the will of the people from their home states. He came right out and admitted that at the later stages of balloting, delegates will not be bound to candidates and can vote for whomever they want to nominate   regardless of the popular vote in the state primaries. The big giveaway, though, was the following statement he gave after that: By the way, this is a nomination for the Republican Party. If you don t like the party, then sit down. The party is choosing a nominee. To say that won t sit well with Trump voters and possibly even Cruz voters is an understatement. Trump s crew won t agreeably sit by only to see the Republican establishment walk away from them and install their  preferred  candidate as the nominee in his place.Reince didn t exactly come out and say it plainly, but he definitely is starting to lay out a framework of plausible deniability when it comes to a possible up-ending of the nomination process. By trying to explain away how a sleeper candidate can be squeezed in at the last minute, and spreading out the blame among many different delegates   some of whom are virtually unknown to regular voters   the RNC can just throw up their hands and say there was  nothing they could do, because of the rules. Many sources have been hinting at either Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney being rolled out as the panic-button replacement for Trump. The importance of this can t be understated.

Tell everyone what you re for, instead of trying to be ridiculously petty and disparaging in an effort to bring someone else down.One of the latest lies about Hillary Clinton is the remark that she somehow is copying Bernie Sanders on raising the minimum wage. However, if anyone has access to the internet, they can easily find a record of her accomplishments, as well as what she s proposed and advocated for   including a minimum wage increase.Watch the video below and you will see Hillary pushing for a raise in the minimum wage back in 1995   that s over 20 years ago. She s clearly been pushing for a better standard of living for workers nationwide long before she even remotely dreamed of running for president.This election needs to be about what each candidate brings to the table; their experience, their plans, their ability to get it done. What this election should not be about, is trying to dissuade people from voting based on lies.And if we re going to really try to get real about wages, we need to think about solutions that will actually work. A flat minimum wage increase, while sounding great on paper, simple to understand, and is a great place to start, won t be as effective as tying wages to the cost of living nationwide. MIT even put out a living wage calculator to help the process along. This may mean higher than a $15/hr wage in some regions, and lower in others. The cost of doing business is different in different regions as well, and that also always needs to be taken into consideration. If businesses are shuttered because they can t afford to stay open, that doesn t help anyone. But it is true that more money in people s pockets puts more money back into the economy, and is the trickle up economy that will serve to help everyone. That s just basic economics.Solutions are there if we re willing to look for them, and we need to figure this out, but that s not going to happen through the noise of trivial political games.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Hillary in 1995: Raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do.

It also requires everyone to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender at birth.This horrific and blatant attempt to deprive a segment of the population of equal rights has not only angered the public, but the Obama administration as well. At this moment, the Justice Department is in the process of determining if the law violates federal civil rights statutes. If it does, the state could lose billions (with a B) of dollars that would otherwise go to fixing highways, education, and housing funding.Cities and states have banned taxpayer-funded travel to North Carolina and production companies have left the state over the law, depriving the state of tax dollars and a boost to local economies where filming took place. Recently, Lionsgate Films canceled filming of a new Hulu show and moved production to Canada.In short, yes. On Tuesday, PayPal announced that it has withdrawn plans for a new blogal operations center in Charlotte   the city that attempted to be inclusive in the first place   that would have employed 400 people in skilled jobs. The new center was announced just weeks ago.

Our decision is a clear and unambiguous one.

As a company that is committed to the principle that everyone deserves to live without fear of discrimination simply for being who they are, becoming an employer in North Carolina, where members of our teams will not have equal rights under the law, is simply untenable. The company says  the new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPal s mission and culture,  leaving them unable to open a center in the state. PayPal is in the process of determining where the new location will be, and says it regrets not having the  opportunity to be part of the Charlotte community.

His recent remarks about women are just one in a series of Trump crazy talk sessions that have left his campaign losing serious momentum.

This time, it came in the form of a temper tantrum with a reporter.Here s the video: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8ctyqB5TTM] MSNBC s Chris Jansing asked Trump if there would be any changes in his campaign staff in what was most likely a reference to a New York magazine article that reported infighting among his staff members.  No, It s just the media again. I get the most unfair media. This is the first time I ve been asked this question. Nobody has called me about this. We are number one in every category,  said Trump.Jansing then asked if Trump was concerned that his staff didn t know that Wisconsin conservative radio host Charlie Sykes was against his candidacy, which set him up for a brutal interview last week. Believing that he won the debate with Sykes, Trump said,  You go into the enemy camp sometimes. He is not a very smart guy, not a very bright guy. Sometimes you go into unfriendly territory. That s part of the game. Here is the transcript from the rest of the interview:Jansing:  Is Wisconsin unfriendly territory? Trump:  No, you said about a radio talk show host. Jansing:  So you re just talking about the radio host? Trump:  That s what I mean about the dishonest media. Jansing:  I m asking you a question, allowing you to answer it.

Trump, like a deer in headlights, delivers what may be the dumbest response ever delivered by a person hoping to bullshit his way through a question he can t answer.It s a beauty to behold.Trump sat down with legendary journalist Bob Woodward to cover a variety of topics. Trump, having clearly not prepared whatsoever, flailed spectacularly throughout. Just one example: I m a very inclusive person. I actually am somebody that gets along with people. And yet from a political standpoint, although I certainly have a lot of fans  you just said hello to Senator Sessions. It s enough to give Sarah Palin a run for her money for the Word Salad of the Year title.However, Trump s train finally derailed completely when Woodward asked him what he though the Republican Party stood for given its legacy as the Party of Abraham Lincoln. Trump responded as if he had never heard the name before.Well, I think Lincoln succeeded for numerous reasons. He was a man who was of great intelligence, which most presidents would be. But he was a man of great intelligence, but he was also a man that did something that was a very vital thing to do at that time. Ten years before or 20 years before, what he was doing would never have even been thought possible. So he did something that was a very important thing to do, and especially at that time.What did Abraham Lincoln do? Don t ask Trump, he just knows it was something  very vital  and  very important. The reaction on Twitter was unforgiving:.@katherinemiller That s verbal diarrhea not an answer to anything.  David Bohm (@DavidJBohm) April 5, 2016 This is like a 7th grade history paper.  @katherinemiller: Does Trump know what Abraham Lincoln did as president? pic.twitter.com/tCuiU1QIxZ  Yes, Nick $earcy! (@yesnicksearcy) April 5, 2016But there is another theory here. Perhaps Trump isn t dumber than a 5th grader. Perhaps he s just more racist than you dared suspect.The fact of the matter is that Trump s campaign has thrived on appealing to the portion of the American public most likely to ask  Why isn t there a White History month?  To many of his supporters, Lincoln s Emancipation Proclamation wasn t necessarily a good thing. A full 20 percent of his supporters say they thought it was a mistake. Some have even argued that African Americans were better off as slaves than  Democrats.  Trump supporter Ben Carson once mused that Obamacare was as bad as slavery.To talk about Lincoln s success is to talk about African Americans and to talk about African Americans is to not talk about the  silent majority  who claim it is white people who are oppressed. So, a good way to sidestep alienating your base is to talk in generalities. Lincoln succeeded  for numerous reasons.  He did  something  that was  vital.  It was  something  that was  very important to do.  Trump may think he has a great relationship with  the blacks  but it s the whites who come out by the thousands to vote for him   and he knows it.I m not sure which is worse: A Republican front-runner who can t articulate who Abraham Lincoln was or one who finds the Emancipation Proclamation so controversial that he can t even mention it as one of the former president s successes.Featured image via White House and Scott Olson/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Steve Southerland, R-Morristown, with a 19-8 vote, sending the legislation to Gov.

As a matter of fact, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery told lawmakers that the bill is unconstitutional and they still went ahead and passed it anyway.The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement condemning lawmakers for their actions: Today Tennessee politicians have voted to reduce what is to many a sacred religious text to a political football. Lawmakers  thinly-veiled effort to promote one religion over other religions clearly violates both the United States and Tennessee Constitutions, as our state attorney general has already pointed out. While the Bible is an important book to many state residents, Tennesseans come from a rich diversity of faiths. Privileging one religion over another not only tramples on the Constitution, it marginalizes the tens of thousands of Tennesseans who choose to practice other religions or not to practice religion at all. We call on Governor Haslam to veto this legislation. Only one positive came out of this   if you are a cup half full kinda person   is that the GOP legislators proved, without a doubt, that all of their declarations of wanting to protect everyone s religious freedom was complete and utter bullshit. Like national Republican lawmakers, the only thing they are concerned with is protecting THEIR religion. They do not actually believe you have the right to worship a god different from theirs, they want everyone to be indoctrinated into Christianity and they don t care what they have to do to make that happen.Their decision to pass this bill goes against the very freedoms our country was built upon. Our founding fathers never wanted one religion to be held in higher regard than another, that s why they made sure to protect all religions in the very first amendment to our Constitution.

Ted Cruz just admitted that he wants to punish women for being raped.During an interview with Fox host Megyn Kelly, Cruz made it clear that he believes rape victims should be barred from terminating any pregnancy that results from the crime.Women  think you may be too far right on social issues,  Kelly told Cruz while pointing out that the GOP presidential wannabe s stance on abortion rights is repelling female voters away from a Republican Party that needs votes from women if it hopes to survive in November.But Ted Cruz refused to budge from his extremist views and openly stated that he believes rape victims should be forced to carry pregnancies that result from rape to term. Rape is a horrific crime against the humanity of a person. But at the same time, as horrible as the crime is, I don t believe it s the child s fault. We want to do every thing we can do to prevent the crime on the front end and to punish the criminal. But I don t believe it makes sense to blame the child. Kelly fired back by informing Cruz that women think he  would be forcing the mother to go through unspeakable trauma to carry her rapist s baby for nine months. On that point, Kelly is correct. Forcing a woman to endure nine grueling months of a pregnancy she did not want only helps the rapist torture his victim more, it rewards the rapist with a child. And in far too many states, a rapist can then sue for parental rights and would be able to harass the victim for the next 18 years of the child s life.Cruz, however, avoided replying to Kelly like the coward he is and dubiously claimed that the decision would be left to the states if Roe v. Wade were to ever be overturned. Here it would be a question for Wisconsin, what should the laws be governing abortion. If Roe v. Wade was not the law, it would be up to the people of Wisconsin and the people of Wisconsin might decide to allow some exceptions or not allow some exceptions because everyone agrees that you always want to protect the life of the mother. Here s the video:Ted Cruz is literally pretending that he would allow each state to have their own abortion laws. In December, Cruz stated his intention to ban abortion nationwide despite what the Supreme Court has ruled.Furthermore, Cruz has also voiced support for a federal ban on abortion after 20 weeks that provided zero exceptions for rape victims. He also supported the Life at Conception Act, which would ban all abortion for any reason and would even outlaw some forms of contraception.In short, Cruz is lying through his teeth when he claims that the states will be able to make their own abortion laws. As president, Cruz would absolutely sign a total ban on abortion if Republicans manage to hold onto the Senate and House after the election in November. In fact, it would probably be one of the first things he does. And that means women absolutely should not trust Ted Cruz.

Not because I imagine myself to be a great journalist (I blog, journalism this ain t) but because I shouldn t have to lie to get a story out. So imagine my disappointment when I saw the following from Raw Story: Barney Frank:  Low information  voters are to blame for problems that make Trump and Sanders appealing.This is a fail on so many levels.First, while the host Jose Diaz-Balart tries to conflate Trump and Sanders voters, it is screamingly obvious that Frank is ONLY talking about Democratic voters the entire time. His entire argument concerns the people who don t come up to vote in midterms and then complain that Obama didn t get things done. No rational person can listen to this and think he s talking about both liberal and conservative voters.If conservative voters were as lazy as liberal voters in the midterms, we wouldn t have the gridlock that s pissing off liberal voters.Second, when we use the term  low information voters,  it has a very specific connotation. We mean people who are not informed compared to the general population about an issue (or issues) but still feel passionately about it. Or, in the case of Fox News viewers, misinformed about an issue and feel enraged about it. When a person insists that Obama is a Muslim or that climate change is a hoax, that is a low information voter. On the liberal side, when someone insists that Hillary Clinton is being investigated by the FBI or that Bernie Sanders is getting rich by running for president, that is also a low information voter. At least on those topics.But that s not what Frank is saying at all. He s lamenting, quite correctly, that the people who couldn t be bothered to vote in the midterms don t understand or don t WANT to understand that the lack of progress that s pissing them off is a direct result of them staying home in 2010 and 2014. That s not calling people  low information voters,  that s calling them out on their hypocrisy.  I want X, Y and Z but I don t wanna have to vote in midterms to get it!  And even though Frank kind of blames Bernie supporters for this, let s be honest, there s zero reason to lay that solely at their feet.The closest Frank gets to calling Bernie followers  low information voters  is when he points out, again, quite correctly, that people don t understand that building controlling majorities in government takes more than one election cycle. If you want to split hairs, sure, they re low information voters, but you re stretching at that point. But it doesn t matter if you like, love or loathe Bernie supporters, they re not low information voters in general and, in this context, certainly not any less informed than the overwhelming majority of Americans. No one uses the phrase to denote a lack of understanding of advanced civics which is why Frank doesn t actually use that phrase in the entire interview.Finally, the anti-establishment anger of Trump and Sanders supporters are coming from two completely different places and Frank never even remotely suggests that the two stem from the same problems as the Raw Story title clearly says he does. The majority of the anger from the Sanders camp is that America is not moving to the left fast enough. The don t like Obamacare because it s not single payer. They don t like Wall Street reform because it wasn t strong enough. Etc. Etc.Trump s supporters aren t angry that the country isn t moving to the right fast enough, they re angry because it s not moving to the right at all! Gays can marry! Obamacare hasn t been repealed! The rich forgot to trickle down their wealth like we were promised by Saint Ronnie! Women still have reproductive rights! Black lives are starting to matter!To say the two are similar is laughable and Frank never comes close to even an insinuation of it.You can be mad at Barney Frank for supporting Hillary if you want, but if you have to lie about what he s saying and why he s saying it, you ve already lost the argument.Here s the video:Featured image via screencap""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Wasserman-Schultz responded that it is drama being caused by the media and I d have to agree. The Democratic candidates have conducted themselves as presidential candidates should, which is vastly different than the insane Republican race that has been filled with horrible attacks and hateful rhetoric.

That is absolutely true.After she finished discussing the GOP field, Noah hit her with the question many people want to know the answer to: A lot of people feel that Bernie Sanders   is being c*ckblocked by the DNC. Is there any merit to this? Wasserman-Schultz answered (after the crowd s cheers died down) that she is not favoring either candidate: As powerful as that makes me feel, I m not doing a very good job of rigging the outcome or blocking anyone from being able to get their message out. The reality is that I have a job as national party chair that is one that requires a thick skin. It requires me to be able to absorb the body blows so our candidates can stay above the fray. Not everyone would agree with this. A very large portion of the Democratic Party (both Hillary and Bernie supporters) are really pissed off at the way she has handled a number of things, especially our debate schedule.

Current legislation, dating from 1993, already bans all terminations except when pregnancy results from rape or incest, poses a health risk to the mother, or if the foetus is severely deformed.Pro-life activists support even tougher legislation but the move has sparked a backlash and thousands of marchers took part in a protest outside the country s parliament in Warsaw yesterday, as well as in several other cities.The move is in sharp contrast to Christian conservatives in the United States, who are actually rallying behind candidates and religious leaders who wear their prejudice and intolerance on their sleeve.

The Judicial branch of the government determines precedent often over cases the people and their elected representatives can t agree on by interpreting their letter and spirit as it applies to our society as well as the intentions of the founders.That s quite a mouthful and a set of expectations that all too often fall by the wayside in favor of partisan politics.

It s counter-productive to maintaining the rule of law and a massive waste of time and resources. As a result, the court has heard cases with little consequence or controversy. The court has agreed to hear eight cases in total this term, which runs until January 2017, five of which were scheduled while Scalia was still alive.

Stein said: In all of my years as an economist, which is roughly 50 years, I ve never seen such nonsense as we just heard from Mr. Trump. And it breaks my heart, it makes me want to cry because I m Republican, I ve never voted for a Democrat, and to think the guy who s our likely standard bearer has such nonsensical ideas on every single aspect of the economy is just breathtakingly horrible. Stein insisted that Trump has zero clue what he s talking about, and that it s  horrifying . The economist compared Trump s nonsensical  and  breathtakingly horrible rhetoric to being told  men from Mars are coming down  and  he s gonna flap his wings and fly. Stein went even further and said that it was only by  sheer idiocy  that anyone could support Trump s  wacky  ideas.Stein, like many before him, also made sure to point out that Trump s success in business (which isn t much when compared to other wealthy business men and considering all of Trump s failures) in no way qualifies him to speak on economics. Stein found it baffling that Trump doesn t actually have any real economic advisers. You know, I don t know what goes on in his head. He s a force of nature. I don t know what goes on in his head. But it s frightening that he has no economist advisers. Carl Icahn, a very smart guy on Wall Street who s made a great deal of money. Steve Wynn who runs the best hotels in Las Vegas. But as far as economic advisers, as far as I can tell, he doesn t have any and he desperately needs some. The things he s saying are wacky as wacky can be. Just off the charts. You can watch Stein tear into Trump below:Stein s hatred for Trump is so great that the conservative has actually confessed he might switch teams and vote for Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders because he s confident that Trump will  sink  the Republican party.

It s up to the next elected president to appoint a replacement. These were literally his exact words for weeks. He and other Republicans claim it will give the American people a  voice  by voting for president, allowing them to determine what side gets to pick a replacement on the Supreme Court.With McConnell s exact words in mind, CNN host Dana Bash asked Mitch if Hillary or Bernie won in November, would Republicans then concede to the will of the people and vote on and/or confirm Merrick Garland during the final months of the Obama presidency?The context is obvious. If Democrats retain control of the presidency and the nominee was content with Garland, then the  people  have spoken and a Democratic nominee should get a hearing and be confirmed. It would be  the will of the people,  as Mitch keeps saying.This is the part where Mitch forgot what he was doing and accidentally spoke truthfully.Mitch s answer to Dana was a total contradiction to every reason he s been giving about why he is holding up the confirmation process. Mitch flat out said that Republicans would NEVER allow President Obama s nominee to be placed on the Supreme Court, even if Democrats won the presidential election in November. He literally went from saying if Democrats win they get their pick, to saying even if they won Republicans would not confirm their appointment. McConnell s lame excuse was that the NRA opposed Garland. Great..

Despite his objections, workers at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, just delivered a huge f*ck you to The Donald with the assistance of the National Labor Relations Board. Since the employees voted to unionize in December, Trump has been fighting racist tooth and Islamophobic nail against the idea that workers deserve some modicum of self-determination   but it seems that even his  huge  hands were not enough to stop the NLRB from officially certifying the union.This comes after numerous dirty tricks, including the use of scare tactics and ironic attempts to convince the Board to throw out the workers  vote because employees were allegedly  intimidated  into agreeing to unionize in the first place. But, of course, it was Trump s goons doing the intimidating: They pressured us a lot [to vote no],  housekeeper Marisela Olvera told ThinkProgress.  They told us the union only wants our money, that if we supported the union we d lose our jobs, that the company would put our names on a blacklist and no other hotels in Las Vegas would hire us. They told us to think of what our children would do if we were out of work. Everyone was very stressed. People were afraid. But bendito sea Di s, we still won, even with all that pressure. Now, Think Progress reports that (with Trump s appeal going about as well as his attempts to win over anyone who isn t a white, straight Christian male) workers are demanding that management tuck its tail between its legs, sit down with them like adults, and work out a contract. We re just waiting for a contract,  housekeeper Maria Jaramillo told the publication.  We deserve one. We re not second-class workers. So we re here, waiting for him. Unfortunately, they may have to wait a while longer. Management says they intend to appeal the Labor Board s decision:Jaramillo and her coworkers then formed a bargaining committee, hoping that management would soon recognize their union and begin negotiating with them. But the Trump hotel signaled this week that they have no intention of doing so. We will continue our fight to ensure a fair election for our valued associates, many of whom vigorously oppose union representation,  said Jill Martin, an attorney for The Trump Organization, in a statement to reporters.  The hearing officer s recommendations erroneously disregarded the severe misconduct undertaken by Union agents, which clearly impacted an incredibly close election.  Trump management has until next week to formally challenge the NLRB recommendation, and then the Board s regional chapter will determine whether or not to certify the union. Even if the local board backs the workers, Trump can further delay by appealing their ruling to the federal board in Washington, D.C. Mr. Trump is a very good business man,  linens worker Rosebert Donato told ThinkProgress, apparently using a loose definition of both  good  and  businessman. Donoto hopes Trump will grow up, put on his big boy pants, and sit down to discuss things with the workers. He says he wants to make America great,  Olvera says.  Well, he should start here in his own house, his own business. He always brags about how he has millions and millions and millions of dollars, but he pays his workers less than most in Las Vegas.

Speaking to reporters at the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C., Obama addressed the Republican front runner s remarks that more countries should have nuclear weapons, and gracefully called Trump out for being a complete idiot when he said: The person who made the statements doesn t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally. It was completely true and obvious statement to most   but not Trump, who lives in a self-absorbed, denial-filled bubble. Always ready to start an immature feud with people far more qualified than himself, Trump has decided to hit back at Obama   in a way that makes him seem like even more of a moron. During a campaign stop in Milwaukee, Wisconsin yesterday, Trump literally decided to tell people that he understands  the world much better  than Obama. Seriously. Watch that ridiculous moment below:For Trump to blatantly say that he knows more about how the world works than Obama, who has been an extremely successful President for the last 8 years and done more for American than Republicans will ever give him credit for, is a hilarious and yet terrifying demonstration in Trump s obvious lack of self-awareness.Trump followed that comment with criticism for the President s treatment of Syrian refugees, making the argument that the United States should not be letting them enter the country. Trump said: We have no idea where they come from. They could be ISIS, and they might not be, but they could be ISIS. Did you ever notice the migration? There are so many young strong men. Where are the women and children?And I said don t let them in, we can t let them in. We ll build a safe zone, we ll build a free zone  We ll get the Gulf states to pay, because I don t want to pay. Currently, Trump is behind his rival, Texas Senator Ted Cruz in Wisconsin   and if Cruz takes the state in its nominating contest on Tuesday, this could be a major turning point in the race for GOP nomination. If Cruz wins, he would get all of the Mid-western state s 42 delegates, making it much harder for Trump to reach the 1,237 delegates he needs to get nominated before the Republican national convention in July.

After a day-long search, a friend found the boy, and like any good citizen, Olzak called the station back to let officers know that the boy had been located and any search attempts should be called off.However, the officers came to the family home anyway. By the time they were finished, they had left her 12-year-old son with broken teeth, a possible concussion, and bruising and trauma to the neck and facial area. As Olzak explained to reporters at KIKD: I just wanted them to be aware. They came over. I talked to an officer for a minute and he walked over to my son. Then he put my son s hand behind his back and like lifted him up in the air and slammed his face into the trunk of a car. Two witnesses, the car s owner Courtney Beck, and Jessica Bowles reported seeing the whole event unfold and were both unable to give a single reason for the officer s extreme actions. Bowles said: I walked up closer and saw a chipped tooth, blood, and two fats lips. Olzak called for more officers, and they agreed that the boy needed medical attention. However, the original officer refused to release the boy from handcuffs throughout the entire visit to the hospital. He was kept in handcuffs until I took him home,  Olzak said.The family sent a tort to the Idaho Falls Police last week, in order to initiate legal proceedings against the officer for using unnecessary and excessive force against a minor. The case reminds us of the growing issue of police being called to help, only to end up killing or injuring the people they should be supporting. One of the most notable cases being the killing of 68-year-old marine veteran Kenneth Chamberlain. White Plains police officers in New York broke into his home and shot him dead after a simple call to go to his aid in a potential medical emergency   and the list is growing. It doesn t help the majority of good police, or the communities that they are meant to protect and serve, to continue making these mistakes with seeming impunity.

Recently, Rachel Maddow reported that Deborah Palfrey s former attorney, Montgomery Blair Sibley, is ready to spill the beans on the previously-unreleased clients who were not outed as part of the original investigation. He has been in possession of these records for years, but has been prevented via restraining order from releasing them.Hundreds of names have been released, but Sibley is in possession of hundreds more   and at least one of them, he says, could alter the 2016 presidential race. To date, he has not named the person or people who made an appearance in the records, but he is adamant about releasing them. Not only has the lawyer filed a request with the Supreme Court to be released from the order that prevents him from making this information public, but he has vowed to release it illegally if need be. He has also set up a  dead man s switch  that will release the information if something happens to him that prevents him from taking action for a period of 72 hours.Many have speculated that Ted Cruz is the name on the list, given the recent National Enquirer piece that  outed  five alleged Cruz mistresses  including Donald Trump s current mouthpiece Katrina Pierson. Previously, Anonymous threatened to release evidence that Cruz frequented prostitutes   and on April 1, an account that claimed to be associated with the hacktivist collective did indeed tweet out a now-deleted image purporting to show Cruz among the many, many phone numbers contacted by Palfrey.First, there is no evidence to show that the account is in any way related to Anonymous. Additionally, it seems as though this alleged phone record may be a fake. A closer look at the image shows a rather suspicious typo on the  Date of invoice.  Specifically, it is 120/01, a date which does not exist   period.There s also the matter of the 1:32 call between 7:19 and 7:35 pm in a list that is otherwise chronological:While it is entirely possible that the records are accurate, and that the records simply contain typos, and while it is convenient and even appetizing to immediately say  BOOM   GOTCHA  after viewing these records, it does not appear that these are legitimate. While there is almost certainly something slimy in the Evangelical Christian s past that will ultimately end him, this image (which was released on April Fools  Day) is likely a fabrication that should be taken with the same grain of salt with which people should take everything conservatives say in general.What involvement, if any, did Cruz have with the DC Madam?

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Why has Fox News been Donald Trump s cheerleader, even while he viciously attacks its employees? The answer may be as simple as blackmail.While much of the Republican establishment has turned on Donald Trump (conservative newspaper National Review published an entire issue bashing Trump, recall), Fox News has been conspicuously on the sidelines. It s certainly not because they want to remain neutral to the political process. This is the network, remember, that has no problem criticizing Obama for, say, eating at a nice restaurant or doing a comedy show. They ve never shied away from wearing their hack-y opinions on their sleeves.But even as Trump goes after one of Fox News  biggest stars, Megyn Kelly, with sexist, disgusting digs at her, the network has repeatedly bent over backwards to accommodate the Republican front-runner.An explosive report in New York magazine may reveal a clue as to why:An odd bit of coincidence had given him a card to play against Fox founder Roger Ailes. In 2014, I published a biography of Ailes, which upset the famously paranoid executive. Several months before it landed in stores, Ailes fired his longtime PR adviser Brian Lewis, accusing him of being a source. During Lewis s severance negotiations, Lewis hired Judd Burstein, a powerhouse litigator, and claimed he had  bombs  that would destroy Ailes and Fox News. That s when Trump got involved.Trump has often bragged about this encounter, citing it as an example of his superior negotiating skills. But he also got something out of it. When Roger was having problems, he didn t call 97 people, he called me,  Trump said. Burstein, it turned out, had worked for Trump briefly in the  90s, and Ailes asked Trump to mediate. Trump ran the negotiations out of his office at Trump Tower.  Roger had lawyers, very expensive lawyers, and they couldn t do anything. I solved the problem.  Fox paid Lewis millions to go away quietly, and Trump, I m told, learned everything Lewis had planned to leak. If Ailes ever truly went to war against Trump, Trump would have the arsenal to launch a retaliatory strike.Information that Fox News head Roger Ailes paid millions to keep quiet is floating around Trump s brain somewhere, just ready to come out of his mouth should the network really provoke him. It s no wonder Ailes has freaked out each time Trump threatened to go nuclear on the network. In a telling moment, when things had come to a head between Fox and Trump, Ailes   the man behind the most watched news network in America   rolled over and showed his belly. Unconditional surrender. Trump won.Roger Ailes just called. He is a great guy & assures me that  Trump  will be treated fairly on @FoxNews. His word is always good!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2015In another example, after Trump went after Kelly, the Fox host opened up to Charlie Rose about how bad for the network Trump s animosity would be:Speaking for herself and Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes, Kelly told Rose,  Neither one of us wanted any sort of a war with Donald Trump. We didn t think that benefited the channel, we didn t think it benefited me, and we don t think it benefited Donald Trump,  adding that she believes Trump would agree.Kelly said they just wanted to  forge forward and put it behind us and not pour anymore fuel on that fire. The result is some cringeworthy segments that feature Fox pundits twisting themselves into pretzels to defend Trump s nonsense. When Trump recently changed his position on abortion three times in two days, with each new stance more nonsensical than the last, Fox s reliably dim-witted Andrea Tantaros found a way to blame his gaffes on a  trap  set by Hillary Clinton to make Trump look stupid.For years, Ailes had exploited Trump s star power to take shots at Obama. The billionaire was a regular guest on the network, and Fox no doubt introduce Trump s brand of egocentric conservatism to millions of viewers. When they had a common enemy in Obama, things were fine. Ailes never seemed to anticipate being placed in a position where Trump would use the dirt he had on Ailes against him. Like the GOP more broadly, Fox helped create the Trump Monster and now seem shocked to find that he has wrested control away from them and is on the warpath. It would almost be funny, if it weren t so scary.Featured image via ThinkProgress screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The immediate effect would be that districts with large numbers of non-eligible voters (like, for instance, Latino immigrants and children), would be lumped together, giving much more power to rural, mostly white and older, districts.I m sure you ll be shocked to know that older white people tend to vote Republican. But that surely wasn t the intent behind this move to consolidate power increase the fairness of elections for white people everyone.If this all sounds a bit confusing (and it should), what Republicans were trying to say is that people who can t vote, children, immigrants, convicted felons, etc. do not deserve the same kind of representation in their local government. Because they re not really people or something. But really, this was just the latest GOP attempt at rigging elections.Right now, the populations of large racially diverse cities mean that those cities have several (or more) voting districts and they tend to be far more liberal than rural, mostly white districts. That means that in a state like Texas, the cities are threatening to overpower the rural areas in terms of electoral power and turn the state purple and eventually blue. The goal of this court case was to reverse that trend and greatly reduce the number of city districts, thus, making the rural (and conservative) districts more powerful.But apparently this was a voter suppression tactic too far for even the conservatives on the Court:Six justices signed on to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg s decision, and Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas   the most conservative members of the court   concurred in the judgment. Total-population apportionment meets the equal protection demand, by rendering each representative alert to the interests and constituent-service requests of all who dwell in the representative s district,  Ginsburg said.Even if Scalia had still been alive, it looks like he might have been the only dissent. And maybe Thomas after Scalia had told him what to think.The conservative Justices were not opposed to the basic premise of the plan (stripping large cities of their voting power), just this particular method. Once Republicans come up with a new avenue of attack (and they will), they ll try it again and if Republicans control the White House and put another Scalia on the bench, they might get away with it next time.See why voting blue is important?Featured image via wikipedia ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Yes, when it s hot in the dry California valleys and deserts it can still be cold in the mountain regions which get more moisture and are much higher in altitude, yet still visible from the valleys and deserts.Rarely would I dub someone so clearly and utterly moronic, but this seems to be well worthy of the condemnation.

The video clearly shows an unarmed Scott running away from the officer. Instead of pursuing Scott, the officer fires eight shots, killing Scott.The city agreed to pay Scott s family $6.5 million, and a grand jury handed down a murder indictment for Officer Michael Slager. Such settlements and indictments for police officers who shoot people are extremely rare, and Walter Scott is one of many black victims over the past few years to be killed by a white police officer, while police departments across the country fail to assume accountability for these constant occurrences. Freddie Gray, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Tanisha Anderson, John Crawford III, Michael Brown Jr   the list goes on and on.People of color are increasingly at risk for being at the wrong place at the wrong time when it comes to excessive force used by many police departments. Instead of holding the officers and their departments accountable, the victims are often subjected to attacks and criticisms to disregard the outrage, unrest, and civil disobedience in cities like Ferguson, Missouri or Baltimore, Maryland. They don t acknowledge the pain and trauma inflicted on these communities by police departments who police in ways that render unarmed people being shot to death. The officer is currently out on bail of $500,000 awaiting trial later this year. This is a travesty, as given the nature of the crime, no bail should have been granted. Non-violent criminals have received stricter bail bonds. Slager also tried to sue the Southern States Police Benevolent Association for not helping him with his defense.Hopefully, there is a murder conviction in this man s future.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Ms. Cho has openly endorsed Bernie Sanders, but has applauded Hillary Clinton s political efforts as well.  What he has done to politics is a travesty. It s a real embarrassment to the nature of politics in America. This was a dignified profession. There is a circus element to him. It s almost like we re looking at Nero. Nero is infamously known as the most tyrannical and insane emperor s Rome ever had. After taking the throne at the age of 17, Nero had his mother killed, was known for overt self-indulging and had anyone who dissented against him killed. For leisure, Nero would wander the streets of Rome and murder people at random.  After a fire burned most of Rome to the ground, Nero pointed the finger at Christians, which began a reign of persecuting and torturing anyone associated with the religion, similar to the rhetoric from Donald Trump against Muslims. A few years later, Rome finally rebelled against Nero s tyrannical rule, and Nero committed suicide, leaving no heir to the throne and a free for all among Rome s military generals to seize power.The rise of Donald Trump has invoked similar fears that such a tyrannical ruler could become President of the United States. Although, it is incredibly unlikely Donald Trump would ever reach the extent Nero did, with the support of a GOP majority in Congress, Donald Trump would likely reverse decades of progressive reforms Democrats have worked endlessly to push into legislation. The Supreme Court could possibly receive a judge incredibly unfit to be serving in such a capacity. Groups such as those who identify with the Muslim religion would be in even greater danger of their rights being taken away as Donald Trump has made proposals similar to those enacted by Adolf Hitler preceding the Holocaust during World War II. The comparisons to Hitler are not that far off,  added Ms. Cho.  It s a very dangerous time.

In 2011, a poll taken among Republicans in the Red state of Mississippi revealed that a shocking 46 percent of them want to ban interracial marriages outright.In 1946, then-Mississippi Governor Theodore Bilbo wrote that [p]urity of race is a gift of God   And God, in his infinite wisdom, has so ordained it that when man destroys his racial purity, it can never be redeemed  and that God  was the original segregationist.  He may be dead, and African-Americans may have rights now  (including the freedom to marry anyone they choose) that they did not have when Bilbo was in charge, but his spirit lives on in RV park landlord Gene Baker, who admitted over the weekend that he evicted an interracial couple simply because they were an interracial couple. Me and my husband, not ever in 10 years have we experienced any problem,  said Erica Flores Dunahoo, who is Hispanic and Native American.  Nobody s given us dirty looks. This is our first time.  Her husband, a former National Guardsman of more than a decade, is black   something that bothers the racist landlord s friends, neighbors, and church.In February, Dunahoo and her husband, Standley Hoskins, and their two children were set to move into an RV sace to save money and  get our life on track,  the lighter half of the interracial couple explained. On February 28, she gave Baker a check for $275 to pay for a month s rent. This should have been the end of it   she paid her rent and inexchange she should have been allowed to stay. In fact, there were no problems that first day. He was real nice,  she said.  He invited me to church and gave me a hug. I bragged on him to my family. Unfortunately, the next morning, Baker called her, fuming:Dunahoo told him that she didn t realize it would be a problem. It is, after all, 2016. Oh, it s a big problem with the members of my church, my community and my mother-in-law, Baker told her.  They don t allow that black and white shacking. We re not shacking. We re married,  she replied, but Baker would have none of it, explaining that  it s the same thing. You don t talk like you wouldn t be with no black man,  the church-going  Christian  continued.  If you would had come across like you were with a black man, we wouldn t have this problem right now. Dunahoo explained that her husband is not a  thug,  and told Baker of his distinguished and lengthy service to our country, but that didn t matter to the landlord. All he saw was black. He returned the $275 and forced them to leave. They took refuge at another RV park, where rent is higher   $325 a month.Baker maintains that he is not a racist, telling the Clarion-Ledger that he only refused to provide a space to the couple because of the issues members of his church and community had with a black man and a light-skinned woman shacking.  He even says they would be welcome to attend his church. They just could not be members, because the church does not believe in interracial marriage.To avoid future issues, he plans to completely close his RV park down just in case he ever encounters another interracial couple who wishes to rent a space: I m closing it down, and that solves the problem. Recently, the Mississippi state Senate passed a  religious liberty  bill allowing businesses to deny service to the LGBT community   just like they used to do (and some individuals currently still do) with interracial couples.Hate is hate   and unfortunately the state of Mississippi is full of it, apparently.Watch a report on this blatant and unabashed act of discrimination below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

If it wasn t their training, they thought, then it had to be their nutrition.Next they did what any good parents would do they conducted research, created a solution and started a company so athletes everywhere could benefit from their discovery.If you think this sounds more like a cheesy advertisement than a summary of academic research, you wouldn t be alone.It gets worse.According to the press release, Doak and Williams were surprised by what they discovered: The freshest milk legally possible, from the best cows, provided more of what athletes  bodies need than any artificial commercial drink: protein 20 grams, as much as most whey drinks, along with a special kind of protein that remains available for hours after drinking it; electrolytes far more than products on the shelf; and calcium and vitamin D for strong bones. They added natural cane sugar and cocoa to make it tasty for kids and to restore glycogen to muscles.But of course they needed proof of this.That s why they gave the University of Maryland $228,910 to conduct  research  through UMD s Industrial Partnership s Program.To understand what that program is, and what it means to the future of independent and ethical research, look no further than the school s own description of it, which cites  academic-industrial, public-private partnerships. In other words, this is a program that conducts privately-funded research on behalf of businesses and corporations.In this case, the ethical problems were entirely obvious.Without releasing any details on the study, the press release proclaimed that:Jae Kun Shim, a professor of kinesiology in the School of Public Health, conducted a year-long study to test how well Fifth Quarter Fresh aides the post-exercise recovery of muscular endurance compared to other popular sports drinks. It outperformed competing products by 13-17 percent. It included the following remarks from Professor Shim: I knew they had a high-quality milk with less damaged protein [than whey protein drinks] and more electrolytes, but I didn t expect it would make much difference for strength endurance recovery. There are many studies out there that show the cardiovascular recovery benefits from milk-based products, but this data is unique because we are showing that the muscular endurance recovery from this chocolate milk is significant. Our data suggests that athletes may be ready faster and better for the next game or practice if they drink Fifth Quarter Fresh chocolate milk. And that s not all folk. According to Industry spokespersons, who had a heavy hand in both the research and the press release:One secret to making higher quality milk, Doak and Williams discovered, is in the cows Jerseys and Guernseys whose milk innately has higher amounts of protein, electrolytes, calcium and carbohydrates than the milk we typically buy in stores. Store milk is produced primarily by Holsteins, which comprise 90 percent of the herds in the U.S. simply because they produce more milk per cow.It went on to claim: Jerseys naturally produce the highest quality milk for human consumption,  said Erick Metzger, general manager of National All-Jersey Inc., an industry group.  Compared to average milk, a glass of Jersey milk has greater nutritional value. Nutrient-dense Jersey milk tastes better because there are more non-fat solids, protein and calcium in Jersey milk when compared with other breeds. The University was forced to retract the study, refunding the $228,910 it received from Fifth Quarters and other milk producers, to conduct what Professor Shim described as a $100,000 research project.On Friday, the University announced the results of the school s internal investigation into the project.As CBS News reports here, the University s investigation found a concerning lack of understanding of the basic principles of conflict of interest in research at all levels of the process. You don t say?The University of Maryland s  chocolate-milk-cures-concussions  research is likely to go down in history as some of the worst corporate-funded pseudo-science of our time.The lack of ethics applied by researchers in this specific study are glaringly apparent, even to the most casual observer.The real concern is that this type of corporate-funded research is taking place more and more often in the United States. Fossil fuel companies pay big money to any  researcher  willing to deny climate change or demonstrate how safe fracking is.The pharmaceutical industry funds the research that determines whether or not the products it markets to consumers are safe, while Biotech corporations fund research into the safety of GMO. The list of industries buying science goes on and on.While we often hear that all this corporate money flowing into America s colleges and universities doesn t influence research, the Fifth Quarters study shows otherwise.

There s so much misinformation out there that it makes my head hurt. As soon as I saw the headline for this article,  Medical marijuana: How to prevent an addiction to weed,  I knew I was in for a frustrating experience.The author of the piece, Dr. David Casarett, spends half of the article on a mea culpa over his part in creating the current epidemic of opioid addiction. Fifteen years ago, he and his fellow doctors shoved pain killers down our throats that were derived from the same stuff we make heroin from and couldn t see why that would be a problem:Fifteen years ago, a crowd of experts including many physicians proclaimed that opioids such as morphine were safe for use in chronic pain. We also downplayed the risk of opioid addiction.For example, one expert statement on chronic pain management in older adults (on which I was an author) said that  Concerns over drug dependency and addiction do not justify the failure to relieve pain. So far, so good. Doctors have been over-prescribing pain killers for years and then abandoning their patients when they re addicted. Casarett is very sorry about his role in this and just doesn t want us to make the same mistake with marijuana:Proponents of medical marijuana advertise its safety. It s natural, they say. In fact, one dispensary owner told me guilelessly,  It s perfectly safe it s from a flower. Not like heroin.  That dispensary owner ignored the fact that heroin is derived from poppies. And that poppies are also flowers.Besides, he told me, theoretical risks of addiction don t justify withholding a potentially beneficial treatment. But that s exactly what many experts were saying about opioids 15 years ago. And we should worry about marijuana addiction.And that s when he goes off the rails. There s one critical difference between marijuana and opioids: You can easily become physically addicted to one and it s almost impossible to become physically addicted to the other.You can become physically addicted to opioids, sugars, alcohol, tobacco and a slew of other chemicals and substances. It is nigh impossible to become physically addicted the same way to pot. It just doesn t happen and Casarett, as a doctor, knows this. This is why he does a bait and switch from  addiction  to  dependence :The good news is that the risk of marijuana dependence is lower than it is for heroin (approximately 9 percent vs. 23 percent). (The term  dependence  is used to describe someone who uses marijuana regularly, even though it impairs their ability to function normally, and despite drug-related physical and psychological problems.) Nevertheless, even if marijuana addiction doesn t turn out to be as devastating as opioid addiction is, it can still result in lost jobs, damaged relationships and lost opportunities.Dependence is VERY different from addiction. Even the government website on marijuana points out, correctly, that you can be dependent on marijuana but not be addicted.I know you might be thinking that I m just another stoner defending his precious weed but, honestly, I don t smoke marijuana and I never have. I have zero interest in it, personally. That being said, I grew up around a great many people who  smoke pot and not one of them ever became addicted to it. And they smoked a lot of the stuff. None of them even became dependent so addiction was right out the window. This is why I know, from first hand experience, that marijuana simply is not addictive. You have a better chance of becoming addicted to the sugar, salt and fat in McDonald s food than you are to pot.It s easy to read Casarett s article and become concerned that we re facing the next drug epidemic but it s just not true.Featured image via Getty ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I do believe that there is a left-leaning bias in news and most of news,  Kelly somehow managed to blurt out without her nose growing like Pinocchio s. You don t believe there is a right-wing bias at Fox, a conservative bias at Fox?  Rose asked even though Kelly s answer was predictable even before he uttered the question. No, I don t. I think that Fox News is fair and balanced. And I think the conservatives who are on air here make no bones about their ideology. Again, Kelly s nose remained the same even though Fox News does, indeed, have a clear right-wing bias and is the propaganda machine of the Republican Party and the evidence of that has piled up over the years.Here s the video via YouTube.In November 2014, Fox News did more than just report that Republicans had taken over the Senate, they openly celebrated about it.In April 2014, Fox head honcho and Kelly s boss Rupert Murdoch actually bragged that his network saved the Republican Party. A Gallup poll even confirms that an overwhelming 94 percent of Fox viewers lean or identify as Republicans.Additionally, even one of the most conservative senators in Congress has repeatedly pointed out that Fox is  totally not fair and totally not balanced. Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn urged his constituents to stop believing everything they hear on Fox because  There are certain shows on Fox I can t watch because they re totally not fair and totally not balanced. Coburn said the same thing to constituents four years earlier in 2010 after Fox News tried to scare people by demonizing the Affordable Care Act and painting Nancy Pelosi as a bad person. The intention is not to put anybody in jail,  Coburn said of the Fox claim that people would go to jail for not purchasing health insurance.  That makes for good TV news on Fox, but that isn t the intention. What we have to have is make sure we have a debate in this country so that you can see what s going on and make the determination yourself,  Coburn continued before blasting Fox for besmirching Pelosi s character.  So, don t catch yourself being biased by Fox News that somebody s no good. Late last year, a Fox News HOST actually had the gall to claim that  everyone benefited  from locking up more black people in a racist statement that drew outrage.Fox News has even told blatant lies on the air about Muslims that they had to publicly apologize for telling.Next up, take a look at just one broadcast of Sean Hannity s show on Fox as an example of his own work to make the network a pit of right-wing bias even as he claims to be  fair and balanced  in the same breath. As one of my colleagues wrote,During a two-minute opening to the segment in which he makes his ludicrous claim, Hannity used the following words and phrases to describe President Obama: liberal, left wing, all out assault on the 2nd Amendment and the rights of law abiding Americans, trampling on your rights, What s his next target? The First Amendment, The Anointed One, failed on the economy, failed to create jobs, failed to reign in radical extremism abroad.Here s the video via Media Matters.Last time I checked, President Obama has not taken anyone s gun away, the economy is stronger than it was eight years ago, and jobs are being created at a record pace. Yet, Fox employees like Hannity still repeat the same accusations over and over again.And finally, let s take a look at Bill O Reilly, who got his ass handed to him by a group of high school students early last year for his lack of journalistic ethics. In their final report after watching a segment of the host s show, the students found that Fox  News  is not  practicing journalism  as much as they are  practicing rank propaganda. In short, Fox News has never been  fair and balanced  and if Megyn Kelly wanted to be known as a credible journalist she should have had the courage to admit it rather than try to sell us another lie like Fox hosts do on a daily basis.Featured image via Myside s Spew""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

After all, if you re staring down the barrel of a Donald Trump or Ted Cruz nomination, the only way you can get out of bed in the morning is if you believe the Democrats have it just as bad.But while the Democratic primary has seen its fair share of infighting and controversy (as any close primary between two strong candidates should!), the idea that the rug will magically be pulled out from under Democrats, handing a presidential victory to a guy like Trump is laughably off-base. And while it s fine to cling to a desperate wish to stave off a complete mental breakdown over the death of your political party, the problem really begins when Republicans start actually believing that fiction.It has led to some seriously delusional thinking, complete with stunning leaps of logic and heaping doses of wishful thinking.

A recent poll found that even half of all white men  white men!  say they despise him.

Look, it was asked as a hypothetical, and talked about if it s illegal and it was hypothetically asked,  Trump claimed.  A very strong conservative group would have said that was the appropriate answer. I m not saying it was the appropriate answer, I say it s the doctor s fault or whoever performs the act, it s their fault. But there was a time when that would have been. After being asked why he singled out women for punishment, Trump again claimed that it was a hypothetical question. Because it was asked hypothetically, Trump said.  I said the woman because it was asked hypothetically. I also corrected it, and I made it very much so that I think everybody   it s acceptable now to everybody. Here s the video via YouTube.Trump has explained his remarks in other ways besides claiming that it was a hypothetical question. He has accused both MSNBC and CBS of editing his remarks and taking them out of context. He has also taken five positions on abortion in the last three days.The bottom line is abortion rights are protected by the 14th Amendment and is a legal and necessary medical procedure. So women and their doctors should not have to face any punishment at all.Anti-abortion groups can claim they don t want to punish women all they want but the fact of the matter is that just by outlawing abortion alone they would be punishing women by forcing them to seek dangerous methods to end their pregnancies in absence of a safe procedure in an equipped medical environment. Women would also be punished because conservatives would also ban many forms of contraception they wrongly believe cause abortions. Clinic closures have also left thousands of women without services such as cancer screenings and STD treatments.And let s not pretend anti-abortion groups haven t threatened, stalked, or harassed women who go to clinics to end their unwanted pregnancies. And forcing women to carry an unwanted pregnancy alone would be a punishment because many women who seek an abortion do so because they cannot afford to bring another child into the world. Basically, conservatives would be punishing women financially. And then there are women who got pregnant as a result of rape. Banning abortion would punish these women by forcing them to give birth to their rapist s baby, sentencing them to many years of having to deal with their rapist, especially in states where rapists can seek parental rights.In addition, Republicans have passed laws ranging from mandatory invasive ultrasounds to waiting periods to fetal homicide laws, which punish women every day. Some are even investigated and have been sent to jail just because of a miscarriage.So, yes, anti-abortion groups want to punish women. To believe otherwise is foolish.

After that, he changed his mind again and  clarified  his original statement by saying doctors who perform abortions should be punished. His fourth position came when he gave an interview for CBS s Face The Nation and claimed that he wouldn t do anything to change abortion laws because the Supreme Court has already decided on their legality with Roe v Wade.When the media said, Wait a second Trump just took a pro-choice stance on abortion by declaring it should remain legal,  his campaign put out a statement saying he would, in fact, try to outlaw it with judicial appointments   taking his fifth abortion position of the week.Well, on Saturday while speaking at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, the Republican frontrunner implied that CBS edited words out of his statement in an attempt to smear him.

As a woman I like Donald Trump, but as a full-blown nutjob, I friggin  love him! Bolduan then questions Hughes defense of Trump s sexism, asking her why she would support someone who tweeted out an obviously sexist picture of Ted Cruz s wife.SNL mocks the sheer length that Hughes will go to in order to defend Trump at any costs and Trump s hand size by having Hughes reply: Actually, that was an accident. Okay cuz  Donald s hands are just so big he can t see what every little tweet his fingers retweet. After confirming that Hughes is  seriously  using that answer, she presses the Trump super fan on the matter of Trump s comments regarding abortion. Hughes then pulls out the first answer she can think fo saying: What that is, was just Donald making an April Fool s joke, cus  it was April Fool s. Bolduan responded to Hughes saying that Trump had made the comment on March 30. Hughes responds while nervously laughing, saying that that is the reason the joke is so funny.You can watch the sketch in full, below.

On Friday, a swarm of Africanized honey bees   killer bees   attacked a group of people in Phoenix, Arizona, stinging more than 20 unfortunate individuals. Normally, a bee attack would not be national news, but it happened to Muslims who were worshipping at a mosque, so Fox News was all over it.The bees descended on the mosque, sending at least one man to the hospital. firefighters fortunately arrived early enough to spray mounds of foam to get the bees under control and prevent further injury.@SKrafftFox10 After a bee stings you its stinger falls out and it dies.Ironic that a group of Muslims were just attacked by Suicide bees.  Libertarian Larry (@Libertarian5000) April 2, 2016 It s always a bad situation when you re talking about Africanized bees, because once one bee creates a pheromone which sends off the other bees to attack,  said Joseph Mikesell with Truly Nolen. It is unclear what set the bees off, but Mikesell warns that if you see bees you should call a professional rather than attempt to deal with a problem yourself. Experts say that the attack was unsurprising, as it is the height of  swarm season. The attack left numerous prayer rugs   and pretty much everything else   drenched in foam that members spent an exhorbitant amount of time shoveling out of the mosque with  whatever they could find,  Fox 10 s Marcy Jones, who called the prayer rugs  oriental,  reported. She warns people not to wear black, red, or yellow because the bees might  think that you are a bear  and become more aggressive around you.It s fortunate that no one was hurt too seriously, but when Fox News Insider posted this important national story on Facebook, readers reacted exactly how one would expect people who have been groomed by Stupidville to react   with utter glee.Some declared this to be God s judgement on the followers of Allah, completely ignorant that  Allah  is simply Arabic for  God  and the two religions actually worship the same deity. Others publicly wished that some of the Muslims injured in the attack had died. Some wanted more bees. The Stupid Part of America completely outdid themselves as they referenced Biblical plagues (because a swarm of bees is totally like a plague of locusts,  while others seized upon the opportunity to tell each other how much they hate Muslims.In short, finding out about this bee attack was the best thing that happened to many conservatives this week:                            This is Trump s America, folks. The supposed  Christian  Right is so wrapped up in hate that they are unable to show a shred of compassion when a group of people are attacked by a tiny-yet-deadly creature   all because they believe their imaginary friend is better than the other, who is actually the same guy.Watch a report on the attack below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

If there is a devil or evil spirit, I truly believe it manifests itself in my family.Later in the same post, he wrote:They have literally robbed my bank account, lied to courts and doctor, to try and label me as mentally ill, and failed in their attempts to have me falsely imprisoned and evicted. If there are any good people on this earth, please help free me from this inhumane slavery.Just ten days later, on March 29, his father murdered him and his mother. Issa s body was found outside the family home. According to police, he was gunned down with a shotgun.His mother s body was found in the bathroom. She died of multiple stab wounds.The L.A. County District Attorney s office called the shooting a hate crime. According to New York Daily News Issa s father had previously threatened to kill him for being gay.A video posted to his Facebook wall shows his father calling him a pervert and saying that he should be castrated.Shehada Khalil Issa is being held in the Los Angeles County jail on a $2,000,000 bond.This tragedy should have never happened.The death of Amir Issa is a heartbreaking reminder of the silent suffering of LGBT men, women and youth.Posts on his Facebook page indicate the family were members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church.On its website, the church states its official position regarding LGBT citizens, saying: The Bible makes no accommodation for homosexual activity or relationships.  Sexual acts outside the circle of a heterosexual marriage are forbidden For these reasons Seventh-day Adventists are opposed to homosexual practices and relationships. Amir Issa wrote on Facebook,  I want to open my eyes lord. I want to see Jesus.  He went on to say he  would like to have a family that attends church regularly,  but one that  doesn t punish my thoughts or actions if I am a good person which I know I am. From his posts, it appears that Amir Issa was murdered by his own father at least in part because of  these fanatical religious beliefs.Although he sent out a cry for help just ten days before he died, like those of so many other members of the LGBT community, his call for help went unanswered.Too often members of the LGBT community are isolated and alone. The isolation makes them more vulnerable to violence and exploitation, often perpetrated by physically, emotionally and mentally abusive family members.Things might have turned out much differently for Amir Issa if only someone had reached out to him ten days before, when he wrote the words: If there are any good people on this earth, please help free me from this inhumane slavery. It s too late now, for good people to reach out to Amir Issa.But it s not too late to reach out to someone else in the LGBT community.It s definitely not too late for our society to demand inclusion, knowing that exclusion leaves people isolated and vulnerable, making them easy targets for violence and abuse.As republicans across the country attempt to pass laws excluding LGBT people from society, it is up to the  good people on this earth  to stand up and say no.Here s more on this story from the New York Daily News.

Stu Soffer, the white man in question, decided to insert himself into an argument when he was told in no uncertain terms by former Democratic Election Commissioner Ted Davis that nobody was talking to him. Davis, who never makes any threatening gestures towards Soffer, was then told to step back by another white guy intervening on first white guy s behalf.Sorry for the lack of names, but by this point all these white guys shouting allegations and preparing for a stand your ground defense start to look alike. And I m a white guy.It s at that point that Soffer pulls a small handgun from his pocket and holds it at his side. He puts it back in his pocket a few moments later but doesn t remove his hand from the pocket until the police arrive several minutes later. Before that happens he can be seen advancing towards Davis at one point and defending his idiocy when a woman calls him out for pulling a gun: I was in fear for my life. I m 74-years-old and I was in fear for my life. It should be noted that the scary black man looks to be about the same age and was unarmed with the exception of a pretty nice three-piece suit. What Soffer probably should have said was,  this is Arkansas, where I can kill a black man with my spiffy argument-winner and get away with it.  The argument itself was over a public meeting of the election commission, where the meeting was adjourned while a Democrat was speaking, cutting him off mid-sentence.Soffer told the Arkansas Times that he retrieved his gun from his car because he  didn t have a good feeling  about things; that Davis approached him with a  weird look on his face.  He said Davis appeared to be in a  trance.  In other words, the scary black man was black, and in the spirit of how black men were convicted across the south for a century for crimes they didn t commit, Soffer claimed he took steps to protect himself kill a man who was definitely black enough to be black and scary and black.Watch the incident unfold for yourself and see if you think Soffer was justified in his close call with the use of deadly force:Featured image from screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This time, he chose the controversial topic of abortion because he s a misogynist and degrading women just comes so effortlessly and naturally to him.First, the business mogul p*ssed everyone off by saying that women who got abortions should face some sort of  punishment.  Then, the disgraced candidate frantically backpedaled and said abortion should be  left to the states , and that it wasn t women that should be punished, but the doctors who perform the abortions! After that, Trump said that abortions laws were  set  and should stay the way they are, before his campaign clarified his statement and said that the laws should remain the same   until Trump is president. As this back-and-forth nonsense went on, the media was pummeling Trump for not being able to make up his damn mind, and for being horrendously offensive.Now, Trump is trying to avoid even more backlash by straight-up refusing to answer questions on the topic of abortion, as America tries to understand what exactly Trump s position on it really is. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd discovered this when she recently tried to interview Trump for her Sunday column entitled  Trump Does It His Way . Dowd said she posed this clever question to the front runner: When he was a swinging bachelor in Manhattan, was he ever involved with anyone who had an abortion? Trump s answered by evading the question entirely. He said: Such an interesting question. So what s your next question? Trump also gave a pathetic justification for his original  punishment  comments on abortion that he d made earlier in the week. He told Dowd: This was not real life   this was a hypothetical, so I thought of it in terms of a hypothetical. So that s where that answer came from, hypothetically. Dowd also asked Trump how he possibly expected to win the election when he had completely turned off and disgusted 73 percent of American woman. Trump simply murmured, It was 68 percent, actually.

We were in the class watching a movie, and I was just laughing at the movie and the teacher said,  I wouldn t be laughing if I was you.  And I said why? She said,  because we all think you re a terrorist. To make matters worse, the teacher s remarks touched off a storm of bullying as the students around him began to verbally harass him. They were like,  oh I see a bomb!  and they started all laughing and making jokes. I was upset and I felt like I was put in the corner and like everybody was just looking at me. In just a matter of seconds, Abushaaban had become a victim of racism and hate and had been humiliated by his fellow classmates who only suddenly turned on him because the teacher did.Understandably, his parents are mad as hell and they want the teacher terminated from her position at the school. Just because my son is a Muslim doesn t mean he is a terrorist,  said Malek Abushaaban.  He s an American. He s as American as anybody else. He was born here. That s all he knows, is how to be an American. Here s the video via KHOU.Of course, school officials are claiming that the teacher merely misspoke in an attempt to teach about negative stereotyping, but did condemn her words in the following statement. While the teacher reports her statements were made in the context of trying to make a point about negative stereotypes, District officials do not believe that the teacher exercised the appropriate sensitivity expected of the District s educators, and do not believe that the statements were made in a manner that is in keeping with the District s Core Beliefs and Commitments. Keep in mind that this happened while the students were in the middle of watching a movie, which makes the job of a teacher a little easier. There was absolutely no need to try and teach anything. In fact, it makes no sense to teach lessons during a film and she was clearly not teaching the rest of the class about negative stereotypes. In other words, this teacher is just trying to cover her ass with a bullshit claim.Texas schools seem to be obsessed with terrorism these days. Just last year, a Texas school freaked out because a Muslim student brought in a clock he had built himself and school personnel called the police because they thought it was a bomb.Another Texas school acted even more ridiculous by suspending a nine-year-old boy for bringing a replica of the One Ring from the Hobbit to class. The school actually accused the boy of committing terrorism because he was pretending that the ring made him invisible.

A group of armed  patriots  that have been showing up to mosques to terrorize Muslims going to pray were scared off by a larger group of armed African American counter-protesters:Racial tensions in South Dallas almost exploded at an anti-mosque protest Saturday afternoon before quickly dissolving when the protesters retreated.A few hundred South Dallas residents, mostly black, flooded Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to oppose a planned demonstration by a mostly white group that routinely protests outside mosques.Both sides were armed.The mosque in question was a predominately black one and the counter-protesters were chanting  Black Power  at the  Murikan protesters.Unfortunately, the counter-protesters included members of the New Black Panther Party. If that name doesn t ring a bell, it s a group of pretenders to the legacy of the Black Panthers that spread anti-white bigotry, something the Black Panthers did not do (much). This is why a counter-protest to protect a mosque became racialized. While I have no doubt most of the protesters were racist as well as anti-Muslim, shifting the focus away from the religious bigotry to racism doesn t help Muslims in the long run. It does, however, help the NBPP and their message of anti-white hate.But although I don t approve of the bigotry, I do approve of the counter-protest. Ammosexuals have been terrorizing people for far too long and it was nice to see them show their true colors when their victims have guns, too. Liberals have been not-exactly-joking that black people need to start carrying rifles to push back against the targeting of their communities and, unsurprisingly, it worked.The problem is that Fox News and right wing media is going to explode over this.

It feeds nicely into the  Hillary is a corporate shill and totally evil  narrative and is now currently gospel among anti-Hillary voters.Too bad it s not true.After Clinton was confronted by a Greenpeace activist demanding she answer for her  ties  to the fossil fuel industry, Clinton uncharacteristically blew a gasket: I have money from people who work for fossil-fuel companies. I am so sick   I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me. This caught my attention because Clinton doesn t normally get that hostile. As a seasoned politician, she s not prone to outbursts. But, as it turns out, she had good reason to be frustrated:According to the Center for Responsive Politics, as of March 21, the Clinton campaign has received nearly $308,000 for individuals in the oil and gas industry. The Sanders campaign has received nearly $54,000.In [sic] you include contributions from outside groups supporting a candidate, Clinton s total increases slightly to $333,000, compared to Sanders  $54,000.A $279,000 difference may sound like a lot to you and me buuuuuuuut .As our colleague Philip Bump noted, about 0.15 percent of Clinton s campaign and outside PAC money is from the  oil and gas industry,  compared to 0.04 percent of Sanders s contributions.Yes, you read that correctly: .15 percent. As in,  less than percent.  As in,  a little more than one tenth of one percent.  Now, you COULD still insist that $308,000 is a huge amount but you d still have to deal with that pesky fact that that money is from individuals that work in the industry, not the industry itself which, according to the Washington Post, has only given 2.3% of all the money it s donated this cycle to Democrats. Not just Clinton but ALL Democrats combined are part of that 2.3%.You know how some people say both parties are the same and in the pocket of Big Oil? Those people are idiots that should try living in the real world for a while.It s also been suggested by Greenpeace that any and all money donated to Clinton Super PACs is all from the fossil fuel industry if the lobbyist has a fossil fuel company as a client:Greenpeace counts all of the money raised or contributed by lobbyists as  oil/gas industry  funds, but these lobbyists have many other clients besides the oil industry. Ben Klein, one of the lobbyists highlighted in the Greenpeace report, also lobbies for American Airlines, Cigna, and Hearst, according to the lobbying disclosure database, so in theory his contributions to the Clinton campaign could also be labeled as funds for airline, insurance or media industry.It s a convenient fiction that, again, plays into the  Hillary is evil  narrative. And, again, this is now gospel to those who hate Clinton. But the fact checkers at the Washington Post say otherwise:The Sanders campaign is exaggerating the contributions that Clinton has received from the oil and gas industry. In the context of her overall campaign, the contributions are hardly significant. It s especially misleading to count all of the funds raised by lobbyists with multiple clients as money  given  by the fossil-fuel industry.This lands the  Hillary is in bed with Big Oil  story a whopping Three Pinocchios.In my opinion, the recent exaggerations and flat-out lies about Hillary Clinton stem from the fact that Republicans have spent 25 years and millions of dollar inventing scandal after scandal with nothing to show for it. None of the old stories have worked and despite Clinton supposedly being guilty of all kinds of crimes and corruption, no one can ever seem to prove anything. At all. This means that she is either the smartest criminal in the history of the world or that she s not the epitome of evil.We should probably leave lies and innuendo to Republicans.

He then orders Pontoon out of the car, patting him down next to the vehicle.A moment later, the video shows him ordering Hicks out of the car.Although the couple has committed no crime, Medlin calls for backup. As additional police officers begin to pour onto the scene, he tells Hicks that her car is going to conduct a canine drug search of the vehicle.He then turns to Pontoon and says,  You gonna pay for this one, boy. A few moments later, Medlin makes good on that threat.After a search of the couple s vehicle produces nothing, the cops then announce,  We gonna search somebody. Medlin tells a female officer to search Hicks  real good. A female officer then  searches  Ms. Hicks, in broad daylight on a public street.As The Washington Post reports: The personal search of Hicks is conducted off camera, but according to the complaint filed by Phillips, it allegedly involved exposing Hicks s breasts on the side of the road in a populated area. The complaint also alleges that this was all done in direct view of the three male officers. The search of Hicks again produces nothing.At this point, they turn their focus back to Pontoon.Medlin again orders the man to get out of the car. After placing him in handcuffs, he begins to pat him down. You ve got something here right between your legs. There s something hard right there between your legs,  he says.Medlin then states that he is going to put on some gloves.Medlin then begins what police are calling a  full cavity search  of the young man. Again, this  search  takes place in broad daylight, on a public street.While the officer s actions take place out of view of the camera, the audio leaves no room for doubt about what is going on.Medlin s statements over the course of the next several minutes indicate that his motive for this invasive roadside search had little to do with conducting any kind of legitimate or necessary search for illegal contraband.As The Washington Post reports: Pontoon at one point says that one of the officers is grabbing his hemorrhoids. Medlin appears to reply,  I ve had hemorrhoids, and they ain t that hard.  At about 12:47:15 in the video, the audio actually suggests that two officers may have inserted fingers into Pontoon s rectum, as one asks,  What are you talking about, right here?  The other replies,  Right straight up in there. Pontoon then again tells the officers that they re pushing on a hemorrhoid. One officer responds,  If that s a hemorrhoid, that s a hemorrhoid, all right? But that don t feel like no hemorrhoid to me. Although a legitimate cavity search takes no longer than a few brief seconds, these officers continue to probe Pontoon s anus for a full three minutes.Once they have finished violating and humiliating the couple, Medlin tells Pontoon,  Now I know you from before, when I worked dope. I seen ya. That s why I put a dog on the car. Pontoon replies that  that s been years and years ago. I ve got kids now,  he says.  That s my wife. The Washington Post reports that Pontoon does have criminal record, but his last arrest was ten years ago, in 2006.Even if he had been arrested last week, though, past behavior does not constitute  reasonable suspicion,  under any definition of the law.After all of this, Medlin tells the couple he is letting them off with a warning. He never specifies what they are being warned not to do. The only crime they have committed is driving while Black.According to The Washington Post Medlin is still employed by the Aikin Police Department.When contacted for comment, Aiken public information officer Capt. David Turno said in an email The City of Aiken denies the Plaintiffs  allegations and is vigorously defending this lawsuit.

At times he seems to acknowledge that the technique which, as described by human rights groups, is best summed up as  simulated drowning,  is inhumane and constitutes torture. He recently told Donald Trump (a yuge fan of waterboarding) if he wanted to reinstate the practice that he would have to  bring your own damn bucket  because the CIA  wouldn t go down that road again.  On the other hand, Hayden s tenure as Bush s CIA head meant he oversaw extensive use of the technique on terror suspects. How do you square that round peg? Stunning levels of cognitive dissonance, of course!Hayden was put on the hotseat in an interview with Al Jazeera, in which reporter Mehdi Hasan effortlessly walked through the former intelligence officer s walls of hypocrisy to get at the kernal of truth at the center: Hayden isn t stupid, and he knows that waterboarding is torture.How do you get a man who has spent the last seven years denying he did anything wrong to admit that he did? Flip the question around and ask whether other people should be using waterboarding. Hayden admits in that case it s  completely different. Hayden: I m not giving an answer!Hasan: Okay. If [Syrian] President Assad waterboards Syrian rebels, you will not call that torture?Hayden: Oh, that s completely different.Hasan: Why? So if America does it it s fine, but if Syria does it it s bad.Hayden starts getting very defensive, arguing that Syria wouldn t waterboard safely (there s an oxymoron) and that when the CIA does it, they do it the proper way, which he then describes. Hasan isn t impressed. Good point,  Hasan deadpans.  Series of near drownings, bubbles rising through open full mouth. That is not torture in your view? Hayden concludes by saying the  legal opinion at the time  was no and that America had a right to use the method because they were careful. So for those keeping score at home, the logic is: America s use of waterboarding during the Bush presidency was not torture, but any use of waterboarding by other nations or by a current or future American president is torture. Spoken like a true member of the Bush Administration:  It s never bad when we do it  was their unspoken motto.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Is waterboarding torture?

He went on and on about the Supreme Court and who the next justice needs to be to replace the recently departed Antonin Scalia.His words are absolute BS, but unfortunately you know so many eat it up out of fear and simply not knowing any better. After all, the Republican party needs its base as uniformed as possible to fill their minds with vile nonsense so they vote against their best interests.Regarding the Court, Cruz said: You know, just a few weeks ago with the passing of Justice Scalia, it underscored the stakes of this election, and it is not one, but two branches of the federal government that hang in the balance. We are one liberal Justice away from a radical five justice majority the likes of which this country s never seen. Because you know, a five Justice conservative majority hasn t at all been radical . Cruz continues: We are one justice away from the Supreme Court effectively stripping religious liberty from Americans all across this country. What? No, seriously   what? Unless someone from the government were to come into your home as a private citizen or protected place of worship and tell you not to worship how you do, religious liberty is still there. No one is stripping anything, except for the freedom to use religion to legally discriminate. If you serve the public, you abide by public laws, including equal protection under the law.Cruz didn t stop there though, he continues: We are one justice away from the Court effectively erasing the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights. Abiding by the  well-regulated  part of the Second Amendment and holding true to its truest intent is not  erasing the Second Amendment.  However, if we re gonna get real about the necessity of the Second Amendment, which was originally written to amend Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution so that all state-run militias will have the capability of being armed and trained when called forth by the Republic in time of need (see also: Whiskey Rebellion), perhaps we should look if the Second Amendment should either be amended or replaced to fit modern needs. That s just common sense, though, and something many would rather ignore.Cruz s pi ce de r sistance is when he says: We are one Justice away from the Supreme Court making us subject to the world court and the United Nations and international law and giving up U.S. sovereignty. What the actual f*ck? How is abiding by international law and treaties to be well-respected around the world giving up U.S. sovereignty? Does he want to rule with an iron fist? Does he want to be dominant and bully nation s we need to continue diplomatic relations with? Cruz is proving now, more than ever, that he s not ready to be Commander-in-Chief, because he literally doesn t know how to be a world leader.Cruz s talk is dangerous and it holds no place in reality. He is talking out of his ass like some bizarre GOP freak show and he needs to be held accountable for his words and actions. How do we do that?

In fact, Trump himself will encourage the crowd to get the protesters out, even going so far as to incite violence. This has been going on for some time now, and many have been waiting for him to be held accountable for his actions and words. Well, it looks like that time is now.On Thursday, a lawsuit was filed by three people who assert that they were attacked, and/or called racial slurs during a Trump campaign event on March 1 in Louisville, Kentucky. According to NBC News: The lawsuit filed Thursday was on behalf of Kashiya Nwanguma, a 21-year-old college student; Molly Shah, a 36-year-old activist; and Henry Brousseau, a 17-year-old high school student. According to WDRB out of Louisville: Three people who claim they were assaulted at the Donald Trump rally on March 1 have filed a lawsuit against Trump, his campaign, a white supremacist and a Korean War Veteran. Those who claim to have been assaulted say they were there to peacefully protest, but Trump stopped his speech to tell the crowd to  get  em out of here. WDRB reports: Nwanguma, a 21-year-old University of Louisville student, claims she was protesting non-violently, carrying a sign depicting Trump s face on the body of a pig. The lawsuit alleges Nwanguma was called racist and sexist slurs and repeatedly assaulted. Heimbach and Bamberger both shoved and struck her, according to the lawsuit. A video of the incident went viral soon after the rally.Shah claims after one of Trump s five comments urging supporters to throw out protestors, Heimbach and others rushed at her small group. Shah said she witnessed someone punch Brousseau and then she was shoved from behind by Heimbach as she began to leave.Brousseau, a 17-year-old high school student, alleges he was punched in the stomach by a one of the Traditionalist Worker Party comrades.  The suit includes unknown defendant  as a party. You can read the full complaint HERE.Seeing what s been happening at Trump rallies nationwide, hearing about these incidents really isn t too hard to believe. These three individuals just finally took truth to power and are filing a much-deserved lawsuit.Listening to Donald Trump at any rally isn t like listening to any sort of politician who truly wants to serve the nation. He s clearly in this election for himself, and this is evident by how much he talks about how great he is throughout any speech. He doesn t want anyone around him to dare question his motives and he s very manipulative with the press, keeping them in pens and only fielding questions that will best suit his own interests. If you dare speak up against him, he ll slander you, and he doesn t seem to be capable of apologizing or owning up to his own mistakes. This is all on top of the fact that he only speaks in applause lines and bumper sticker phrases while encouraging his crowds to be violent. He s literally taking a crop of blindly misinformed nitwits and using them as his own personal Brownshirts, reminiscent of another harsh dictator from Germany who came into power in the 1930s.Trump must be stopped and he must be held accountable. This lawsuit is hopefully the first of many in the quest to make sure he never sets foot inside the Oval Office.Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

On Wednesday, during a town hall discussion with MSNBC s Chris Matthews, Trump told the host that he believes the Roe v. Wade should be overturned and abortion should be banned. When the medical procedure is banned he said that women who get an abortion should be punished. It all went downhill from there.Shortly before the interview was set to air, Trump said the abortion issue should be  left to the states.  When he realized that people were still pretty pissed off, he said that he meant women who have abortions are  victims  and if he has his way he will punish the doctors who perform them. But now, he is once again changing his tune and is going full-on pro-choice liberal.During an interview with CBS  John Dickerson (set to air Sunday) Trump was asked about his position on abortion laws and he responded: I would ve preferred states  rights,  he added.  I think it would ve been better if it were up to the states. But right now, the laws are set .At this moment, the laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way. Dickerson was clearly surprised by his obvious liberal position and asked, Do you think abortion is murder?  Trump replied: I have my opinions on it, but I d rather not comment on it. Right now, the current laws make abortion 100 percent legal and he is saying that he does not believe they should be changed. That means that he is not pro-life, but instead pro-choice. Which, by the way, is the position he always had until he realized that he could appeal to America s ignorant imbeciles and changed his long-held position.After this clip from the Face The Nation interview was aired and the media reacted, Trump s campaign once again scrambled to  clarify  his statement, saying: Mr. Trump gave an accurate account of the law as it is today and made clear it must stay that way now   until he is President. Then he will change the law through his judicial appointments and allow the states to protect the unborn. There is nothing new or different here. That s actually not what he said at all, but it s funny that they are trying to spin it again.Watch the clip below:Featured image via Tom Pennington/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

At the time, Beck (and Palin) blamed Obama for the children being sent to the border to escape violence and famine in South and Central America. Beck enlisted Ted Cruz to help deliver the packages. It was their way of opportunistically doing something nice for the kids, while also publicly shaming a president that they hated.What s baffling is that Palin seems to believe that the soccer balls doled out by Glenn Beck in 2014 actually drove immigrants to come to America.

Although a senator, Sanders doesn t come from a famous political family, nor is he a party favorite. However, Sanders has taken the country by storm and ignited an energy and excitement for the political process not seen in decades. That s because Sanders  ideas have hit home for many people. His new campaign ad for the presidency sums up his policies in such an impassioned way that it will leave you in tears. The ad begins with the statement: What does it mean to lead a moral life? When we talk about morality, and when we talk about hope, we have to understand that there is no justice when so few have so much and so many have so little. There is no justice when the top 1/10th% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. Sanders also touches on the fact that  millions of people are working long hours  but unable to feed their children, and the fact that the United States today has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any country in the developed world. Instead, Sanders says we use our money for the wrong reasons: How can we talk about morality and justice when we turn our backs on the children of our country? We have in this country sufficient amounts of money to put more people in jail than any other country on earth but apparently we do not have enough money to provide jobs and education to our young people. The touching four minute ad continues to hit on topics vital to the interests of millions of Americans including healthcare  to all people as a right. All of the people, the poor and the wretched have a right to go to the doctor when they are sick.

Cruz called for a national  right to work  law, which would prevent unions from automatically collecting dues from employees that they cover. This would cause the labor unions to go bankrupt and make workers lose practically all of their collective bargaining power resulting in lower wages, worse working environments, and a reduction or loss of benefits.Hearing someone like Cruz, who completely embraces the idea of states  rights when it suits them, calling for a federal law to override all state-based labor union protections is a joke. Hypocrisy is not new to Cruz or Republicans, though. Cruz called for the law to protect the  fundamental rights  of employees. Common spin on legislation like this is that somehow the mandatory dues deducted from your paycheck to fund union representation are a violation of your rights as a worker.Apparently, the rights to collective bargaining and the fact you lose about 1500 dollars a year if you are non-union are completely lost to your average Republican legislator and voter. This is why these laws are regularly called  right to work for less. The sudden obsession with labor law is a strange diversion for Cruz, who worries more about finding ways to legalize discrimination and repeal Obamacare. The reason for it likely has less to do with allowing employers to steal money from their workers, and more with the fact he is trying to win the Wisconsin Republican primary.Cruz is echoing the only noteworthy thing Koch puppet Governor Scott Walker managed to do during his time as Governor of Wisconsin. Walker s entire claim to fame was being the corporate goon boy for attacks on labor unions. Despite his reasonable success in ruining labor unions in the state, Wisconsin still has some of the worst job prospects in America and shows no signs of serious improvement anytime soon. How advocating for a nationwide roll out of a huge Republican policy failure will help Cruz is anyone s guess.

In protest, some students walked out rather than have religion shoved down their throats.Kristina Coffman was one of those students and she expressed discomfort over what Hendrix did. It was weird,  she told THV11.  He shouldn t have done it because there are a lot of students that have different religions. It just didn t feel right. One student even recorded Hendrix whining about Democrats and liberals and political correctness.In all, five students walked out of the classroom and some students who watched the film bullied others after doing so. Hendrix also made students take a quiz about the movie afterwards. Not only are parents angry, the ACLU isn t very happy about the situation either.Arkansas ACLU executive director Rita Sklar said the organization is considering filing an ethics complaint. It s religious proselytization. It has nothing to do with the class, which is history since 1890,  Sklar said.  Kids having the religious liberty in school means they can express their religious views. It doesn t mean the teacher can.

By showing this film, he also exposed the students to R-rated material that included graphic violence. Many consider the film to be anti-Semitic and scholars have criticized the film for historical and biblical inaccuracies.Clearly, this film should never have been shown to students at all, and Hendrix should have focused on history after 1890.

For example, 75 percent of women view him unfavorably. Among young voters, 80 percent have an unfavorable view of the current Republican frontrunner. Not surprisingly, Hispanic voters like Trump the least, with 85 percent having an unfavorable view.Half of all republican voters said they view Trump unfavorably. What s more, just 20 percent of Republicans said they would oppose attempts to stop Trump from gaining the party s nomination. More than twice as many, 43 percent, said they would support such an effort.While only 34 percent of republicans surveyed said they want to see Trump become president of the United States, that number is still higher than the number of voters who support challengers Ted Cruz or John Kasich.He may manage to gain the republican nomination, but Trump s very low favorability rating is not going to carry him through a general election.According to Real Clear Politics, both democratic candidates would defeat Donald Trump in the general election.Hillary Clinton leads Trump by 10.6 points, according to the site s general election matchup predictions.Clinton s democratic competitor, Bernie Sanders, leads Trump by an even larger margin nationally, with a 15.8 percentage point lead over the republican frontrunner.It s easy to see why republicans are willing to do just about anything to stop Trump from winning the party s nomination.Trump may poll favorably among a small portion of republican voters, but you can t win a general election when democrats, independents, women, Hispanic voters, young adults, even half of the people in your own party literally despise you.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Coming in at number one on the list is Michigan s Republican governor Rick Snyder.Fortune gave Snyder the  Don t Blame Me, I m Just The Governor Award  for his failures over his handling of the Flint water crisis. Fortune writes:Snyder and his team sparked national outrage after an attempt at cost-savings left the impoverished city of Flint, Mich. with a lead-tainted water supply that is being blamed for illness and brain damage, especially among its youngest residents. Called to testify before Congress, Snyder, who touted his competence in his gubernatorial campaign, labeled the experience the  most humbling  of his life then attempted to shift blame. He described it as a  failure of government  and blasted the Environmental Protection Agency for its  dumb and dangerous  rules on allowable amounts of lead in water systems.Because you don t win an award like that and not offer a response, Ari Adler, a spokesman for Snyder, said that Snyder is concerned with  fixing problems, not internet polls.  The rank of each leader received was based on internet votes. Though, the 19 leaders in the poll were chosen by Fortune s editorial staff.Adler also said: The decision on whether to use corrosion control in the Flint water supply was not about saving money, but rather was a mistake made by bureaucrats who misinterpreted a flawed federal rule. Gov. Snyder is the only leader at all levels of government involved in the Flint water crisis who has been willing to stand up and apologize, take responsibility for what happened on his watch, and tackle the problems head on to fix what happened in Flint and fix the system that caused it to happen. It s responses like this that make one wonder how much money Snyder has wasted after he hired two PR firms while the nation raged against him. You can t say that you have accepted responsibility for a crisis right after you blame other people for that crisis.There is also the fact that the Flint water crisis did not happen in a bubble. It happened while the Snyder administration worked fervently to erode democracy in Michigan. It happened while Detroit s and other communities school systems and critical infrastructure were left to ruin.That s why Snyder s sorry-not-sorry is even more disingenuous than it might seem at first glance. He has at no point even acknowledged that his administration s system-wide dismantlement of local governments and austerity measurements that have proven to be fatal, have anything to do with the crisis. The only thing Snyder kind-of-but-not-really acknowledges is that his administration is in charge and, therefore, shares some of the responsibility for the Flint water crisis on the basis of Snyder being Michigan s figurehead.So here s to Snyder s latest achievement. Let it be the first of many.Featured Image:  (Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images) ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

So much so, that there was even an analysis done on the offensiveness of Cruz s face! Trump is using this to his full advantage in his new Instagram video, which is so creatively entitled  Nobody Likes Ted The short video goes through several instances where Cruz s peers have insulted and spoken about how much they dislike him. Testimonials from Cruz s former college roommate Craig Mazin, old bosses like Bill O Reilly and fellow senators all get their fair share of the spotlight in footage that will surely take Cruz s ego down several notches.Mazin s appearance in the video was no surprise   he s spoken openly about his disdain for Cruz several times before. However, former Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole is an interesting addition, as he suggests he might  oversleep  on election day if Cruz is nominated. Senator Lindsey Graham, who chose to endorse Cruz s campaign over Trump s, has previously made it perfectly clear that his endorsement in no way means that he likes Cruz, and that he believes the Texas senator is just as bad as President Barack Obama,  if not worse.  Another hilarious part features Bill O Reilly telling Cruz that former President George W. Bush doesn t like him!

Greenberg goes on to tell Bloomberg that the jump in support from these core Democratic-leaning groups  means we re getting closer and closer to an earthquake election.

When not giving churches the ability to create  militias for God  with the power to use deadly force and carry firearms, the state s largely conservative legislature has been busy attacking gay rights with something bordering on obsession.Mississippi s state Senate pushed through a vicious anti-gay bill that would:But if that wasn t enough, the bill also reinforced Mississippi s long-standing ban on same-sex couples from adopting children. The insane bigotry on display in Mississippi in the face of current trends towards LGBT rights has led to bizarre work arounds, including social workers asking same-sex couples to live in separate houses for at least six months so they could legally pretend to be single parents *wink wink* and not two loving ones who happen to be gay.A federal judge took one look at the case and concluded that Mississippi was violating a mountain of human rights.Written by U.S. District Judge Daniel Jordan III, the order argued that the state s law barring the adoptions obviously targets married gay couples and limits their rights.  Furthermore, the court argued that the Department of Human Services  policy violates the constitution s equal protection clause as the result of last year s landmark Supreme Court ruling that laws against same-sex marriage are unconstitutional.In short: You can t tell same-sex couples that they can t have children just because you don t happen to like same-sex marriage. It doesn t work that way.The fact of the matter is that Mississippi has absolutely no case   other than unmitigated bigotry   to justify its same-sex adoption ban. Study after study has shown that adopted children in same-sex households do just as well as their counterparts adopted by heterosexual parents. In one major study, researchers discovered that kids raised in same-sex households actually did better.In light of that research, preventing gay couples from adopting isn t just a major screw you to the potential parents, but also to the kids waiting in foster homes. Republican lawmakers may feel comfortable telling gay Mississippians that they aren t allowed to have children, but it takes a particularly heartless person to coldly explain to a child that they can t have a family because a few politicians in the Capitol find same-sex marriage  icky. Thankfully, Judge Jordan s ruling isn t just good news for the people of Mississippi, but have far-reaching implications. As of now, the Department of Human Serves doesn t explicitly protect sexual orientation from adoption discrimination. Jordan called bullshit. According to his ruling, that policy is, in itself, discrimination and should be amended. That would mean Mississippi would be just the first of several Republican states to suddenly have their bigoted adoption policies dismantled.If it stands it means a lot of kids waiting for adoption are about to get some great news.Featured image via Wikipedia ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the RNC. she said. It has been an honor to work for Chairman Priebus during an exciting time in politics. It has been exciting to have a front row seat to a national Republican movement to maintain the House and win back the Senate. Chairman Priebus is an innovative leader who empowers his team, and serves my Party as a humble servant leader. It could merely be a coincidence that Quarker-Hartsfield just happens to be abandoning her post at a time when it s likely the racist Trump has destroyed just about every effort the GOP has tried to attract minority voters.But when you consider that three other black staffers have jumped ship over the last few months, it becomes less of a coincidence and more of a sign.Huffington Post reports:Quarker-Hartsfield joins several other staffers of color who have departed the RNC recently. Orlando Watson, communications director for black media, left earlier this month. Tara Wall and Raffi Williams, son of Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, both left their press positions at the RNC late last year.Though Williams denies that he left the RNC because of Trump or the racist rhetoric that has taken over the GOP, one can t help but wonder if it bothers him and the other black staffers on any level.Clearly, the RNC is experiencing problems reaching out to minority voters and Trump is making that effort even more difficult as Hispanics, women, African-Americans, and Muslims have all been targeted by Trump supporters and Trump s nasty rhetoric.It certainly appears that with Trump in the lead, some black staffers at the RNC just didn t want to waste their time trying to reach out to voters because it is kinda hard to convince minority voters that your party isn t racist when a racist has been all but crowned as the Republican nominee.

The tricky part is that Cosby has not been convicted of a crime (yet)   but also that he s had an enormous impact in his field. Even if (when) he s convicted, does that really negate his pervasive influence in the entertainment industry? More importantly, as Lonnie Brunch, Founding Director of the museum points out, too much of black history has been disappeared and censoring Cosby would only add to that unfortunate trend.On the other hand, it s pretty clear that Cosby is a sleaze and not mentioning that would be a true disservice to his unbelievable number of victims and deprive the public of the full context of who he was.Here s the museum s statement in full:There have been many misconceptions and mistaken notions about the presence of Bill Cosby within the National Museum of African American History and Culture s exhibition,  Taking the Stage,  that explores the history of African American participation in film, theatre and television. This is not an exhibition that  honors or celebrates  Bill Cosby but one that acknowledges his role, among many others, in American entertainment. Some people feel that the Smithsonian should eliminate all mention of Bill Cosby as a result of recent revelations. We understand but respectfully disagree. For too long, aspects of African American history have been erased and undervalued, creating an incomplete interpretation of the American past. This museum seeks to tell, in the words of the eminent historian John Hope Franklin,  the unvarnished truth  that will help our visitors to remember and better understand what has often been erased and forgotten. Like all of history, our interpretation of Bill Cosby is a work in progress, something that will continue to evolve as new evidence and insights come to the fore.

Since the first Ford factory pushed out a production automobile, forever changing the way we travel, those countries with the means to fuel the internal combustion engine have prospered.The United States has prided itself on being peacemakers since World War II, but all too often we are held captive by what would otherwise be third world nations, often ruled by religious zealots and ruthless dictators. The first Gulf War was the perfect example. Kuwait, a long-standing ally and major supplier of oil to the U.S., was toppled within days by Saddam Hussein, who wanted control of their port and their oil. The United States had no choice but to step in, calling it a humanitarian mission and sending Hussein back to Baghdad, but stopping short of toppling his regime once the oil was secured. Suddenly, it became far more important to put out oil field fires than it was to remove a ruthless murderer from power.Our government and our allies have to protect the interests of their people. In doing so we are stuck dealing with people like the Saudis, who have a Royal Family with good intentions but are ultimately ruled by fundamentalist clerics at the local level. Human rights violations far exceed what we would consider acceptable if they weren t such a large supplier of oil to NATO countries. There are examples of the same kinds of abuses from all over the oil-rich world, but the black gold tends to keep anyone from being held accountable.So how could we make it possible to rid the world of tyranny and oppression bought and paid for with crude oil? By eliminating it from the equation. Elon Musk and Tesla have just announced that we are one giant leap closer to that goal with the rollout of the model 3 , a production model fully electric car that will be available by the end of 2107 for a starting price of $35,000. With the power to go from zero to 60 in six seconds and more than 200 miles on a single charge, the Tesla model 3 could realistically change the world.Once an idea becomes a reality, the next step is to make it affordable. While $35K may seem out of reach for many, it s certainly right in line with the $33,500 average selling price of a new car in America. From there the technology should migrate to other modes of transportation.

It also seems highly unlikely that the same court that held a state cannot ban gay marriage because it would deny benefits   expressly including the right to adopt   would then conclude that married gay couples can be denied that very same benefit. Mississippi was the last state in the country to stubbornly fight for their ban, first enacted in 2000, to discriminate against same sex couples from adopting. Alabama, Florida, Michigan, and Nebraska had similar laws, but have been overturned prior to this ruling. Mississippi did manage to pass a religious freedom discriminatory bill, allowing businesses to discriminate against the LGBT community, and restrictions still remain in several states for same-sex foster parents from discrimination. This welcome decision affirms that  qualified same-sex couples in Mississippi seeking to become adoptive or foster parents are entitled to equal treatment under the law, and commits to the well-being of children in our state who need loving homes,  said Rob Hill, the Human Rights Campaign State Director of Mississippi, in a statement.

The messages referred to Black people as n*gg*rs and savages.The text messages revealed a culture of racism and homophobia within the department. One officer wrote about watching Black children  like a hawk. An exchange between two other cops read: I hate to tell you this but my wife friend [sic] is over with their kids and her husband is black! If [sic] is an Attorney but should I be worried? A second officer responded by texting, Get ur pocket gun. Keep it available in case the monkey returns to his roots. Its [sic] not against the law to put an animal down. The newly discovered texts were exchanged by a group of officers who were not connected to the previous texting scandal.While Gascon s office did not release the texts, according to KCBS the officers used racist and homophobic comments, while mocking the public outcry over the racist and homophobic texts sent by their fellow officers.Gascon, who created an independent panel to investigate racism inside the San Francisco police department, said the problem is not just a few isolated incidents of racism and homophobia. This problem is more systemic and it needs to be addressed in a more deeper fashion,  he told KCBS.After the text messages were uncovered last year, multiple criminal cases which were thought to be tainted by the officers involved in the texting scandal were dismissed by the District Attorney s Office.According to San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi, the newly uncovered texts may be grounds to dismiss a number of additional cases.In a statement released on Thursday, Adachi wrote: In light of revelations that a second group of San Francisco police officers exchanged racist and homophobic text messages, my office will begin a full review of past cases that may have been tainted by these officers. I am also calling for an independent investigation into when the police chief and district attorney learned of the text messages. Every person in San Francisco deserves equal justice.

Now, it looks like he will be facing a criminal investigation for buying Ben Carson s endorsement with an illegal job offer.Last month, Ben Carson made it very clear that he did not endorse Donald Trump because he likes him, agrees with his policies, or even thinks he should be President   Trump offered him a job in his future administration in exchange for Carson s unwavering servitude. So far, he s been a good little  house boy  for the billionaire, heaping praise on the 2016 hopeful and even defending Trump s recent comments that women should face punishment for having an abortion.But this latest bought-and-paid-for bromance may cause some complication in Trump s life. Public interest group the American Democracy Legal Fund has filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Criminal Division, asking for an investigation into Trump s actions. Noting that federal law prohibits a candidate from promising a position to  any person  in exchange for support, the ADLF penned a letter demanding that Trump s illegal actions be investigated:American Democracy Legal Fund ( ADLF ) is a group established to hold candidates for office accountable for possible ethics and/or legal violations.  It has recently come to light that Mr. Donald Trump may have willfully offered Dr. Ben Carson an appointment to his administration should he become president in return for supporting his candidacy in violation of 18 U.S.C.   599.  ADLF respectfully requests that you investigate this matter and take all appropriate action as soon as possible.Former presidential candidate Dr. Carson endorsed Mr. Trump for the Republican presidential nomination on March 11, 2016.  Mr. Trump and Dr. Carson met the day before to discuss and finalize the endorsement.  Three days later, on March 14, Dr. Carson gave an interview to Newsmax TV to discuss his recent endorsement of Mr. Trump.  During the interview, Dr. Carson stated that he believed Mr. Trump would  surround himself with very good people.  When asked if he would be one of those people, Dr. Carson responded,  I will be doing things as well.  When the interviewer asked whether that meant in a Trump administration, Dr. Carson replied,  Certainly in an advisory capacity.  The interviewer then asked Dr. Carson if  that s been determined  and followed by asking,  When you sat down with [Mr. Trump] that was discussed?  Dr. Carson openly admitted,  Yes,  and said that while they  hadn t hammered out all the details,   it is very important that we work together.   When asked if this meant a cabinet position, Dr. Carson declined to  reveal any details about it right now, because all of this is still very liquid. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.   599,  [w]hoever, being a candidate, directly or indirectly promises or pledges the appointment, or the use of his influence or support for the appointment of any person to any public or private position or employment, for the purpose of procuring support in his candidacy shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if the violation was willful, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both. Dr. Carson s comments strongly suggest that Mr. Trump promised him an administration position in return for his endorsement.  In his interview, Dr. Carson stated that he would  certainly  have an advisory capacity within a potential Trump administration.  When asked directly whether this role was discussed during their endorsement meeting, Dr. Carson responded,  Yes.  Dr. Carson s assured answers lead to the reasonable conclusion that Mr. Trump promised Dr. Carson an administration post in order to secure his endorsement in violation of 18 U.S.C.   599.Federal law prohibits a candidate from directly or indirectly promising the appointment of any person to any public or private position in exchange for his or her support.  Dr. Carson s comments indicate that Mr. Trump used the promise of a role in his administration to secure Dr. Carson s support for his presidential campaign.  For the above stated reasons, we respectfully request that you undertake an immediate investigation of this matter.Trump cares nothing about the law. This is obvious to even the most casual observer after hearing him talk about killing terrorists  families, establishing a national Muslim database, and establishing Muslim concentration camp. Trump, a man who promises to pay for his supporters  legal defense when they beat up African-Americans at his rallies, is completely detestable. Somehow, it is almost poetic that his illegal interactions with a black man might finally bring him down.Now we must wonder: who else did he buy off?Featured image via Bloomberg Finance""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

From putting tens of thousands of mom and pop stores out of business, union-busting, gender wage discrimination and utilizing slave labor in developing nations, Walmart has used its power to make the lives of millions of people miserable. And that s BEFORE you include leeching billions in taxpayer money by forcing their workers to live off of government assistance. All so a handful of billionaires can get even richer.But it looks like unrestrained greed can only get you so far:For the first time ever   or at least since the company went public some 45 years ago   Walmart s revenues shrank from the year before, according to its annual financial filing released Wednesday.Walmart is clearly having trouble adapting its gigantic stores to the Internet age. To be sure, it is a retail juggernaut that brings in half a trillion dollars (that s right, trillion) in sales every year. And with more than 11,500 stores in 28 countries,there s no way it will disappear anytime soon. Though Walmart shares were a safe haven in the rocky start of 2016, investors are pricing in more weakness. The stock has fallen behind retail competitors and the broader market.In February, Walmart lowered its annual net sales growth forecast to  relatively flat,  from earlier guidance that called for an increase of as much as 4 percent (the company has pointed out that previous guidance didn t account for currency changes, which have stung the global retailer).Ironically, part of this drop in revenue is due to Walmart focusing less on cutting operating expenses (like those pesky  salaries  that workers are always complaining about) and actual increased the pay for 1.2 million workers earlier this year.While a Republican might point to this and scream,  AHA! PROOF that paying the peons, I mean  valuable employees,  more is BAD for business! , less insane people would point out that a workforce of 1.2 million people that have more money will almost certainly spend some of that money at a store that carries most of the stuff they need. Like, for instance, Walmart?These hypothetical less crazy people might also point out that paying 1.2 million people more money would boost the economy and that a healthier economy means more people have more money to spend at places like, for instance again, Walmart. Because let s be honest, Walmart is not paying more out of the goodness of its cold, calculating corporate heart.It s too much to hope that the embodiment of everything wrong with unrestrained capitalism will go out of business and, frankly, that would be an unemployment disaster, but we can hope for a steady decline and THEN a collapse. I would also be happy if Walmart s board simply had an epiphany that crushing the middle class is not a viable long term strategy. Sure, paying a living wage would mean the shareholders would make less money but if the alternative is eventually going out of business because there s not enough demand, it would be more than worth the short term sting.Either way, let s hope this dip in revenue is the start of something good for America and the world.Featured image via AI archives""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Susan Sarandon and Deborah Messing, women well-known for being champions of liberal causes, ended up in a Twitter battle that could only be referred to as unfortunate.The incident occurred when Sarandon, in an interview with MSNBC, seemed to come out in support of the  Bernie or Bust  movement that has huge numbers of Bernie Sanders supporters vowing to either stay home or support Donald Trump if Sanders loses the Democratic nomination:Susan Sarandon backing Bernie Sanders is no secret, and certainly there s nothing wrong with it. Unfortunately, the growing movement inside the Sanders support base to take such a harsh stance of another Democrat to the point that you would cut off your own nose to spite your face by allowing a Republican   especially Donald Trump   into the White House just doesn t make sense. The language Sarandon used seemed to say she would go so far as to support Donald Trump, which fellow actress Jamie Lee Curtis just couldn t let slide:I respect but disagree with @SusanSarandon. A possible support of Trump over @HillaryClinton is dangerous 2 women, minorities & immigrants.  Jamie Lee Curtis (@jamieleecurtis) March 29, 2016Sarandon cleared that up immediately, tweeting back:Of course I would never support Trump for any reason. If you watch the interview you'll see that's not what I said. https://t.co/wQk0cMmeyp  Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) March 29, 2016No, it isn t. What she said is that Trump would cause a revolution, and when asked what she would do is Bernie lost, she said she would  wait and see.  Deborah Messing, another avid Democrat and political activist, chimed in at that point and engaged in a back and forth with Sarandon that highlights the Democratic party s issues with unity, something we re supposed to be better at than Republicans:Susan Sarandon muses tht Trump prezcy wud b better 4 the country thn Hillary.Wonder if she'd say that if she were poor,gay,Muslim or immgrnt  Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016LOL that I would ever vote Trump. https://t.co/pnENMgmbvm  Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) March 29, 20161-What kind of revolution?!

Trump does not. https://t.co/oLueAHCaUe  Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 30, 2016To be fair, Messing makes excellent points, but is she attacking an ally?

Sarandon is suggesting that Bernie supporters aren t necessarily Democrats but Independents and even Republicans. Her support for her candidate is unwavering. It s unfortunate that she felt the need to attack Secretary Clinton the way she did, but she is entitled to her opinion. Messing was also sticking to her convictions, which seem to be more consistent with putting a Democrat in the White House regardless of the nominee.#BernieOrBust is perhaps the most absurd political movement considering if the senator loses the primaries he will undoubtedly throw his support behind Clinton. Clinton has already proven what she will do if she loses when she not only supported Barack Obama in 2008 but called for a quorum call nomination at the Democratic National Convention that both ended the voting and united the party around a single candidate.The candidates will continue their battle because that s what candidates do. Their supporters will continue to support them because that s what they do.

The thing is, everyone has been railing Trump s nutty comments regarding punishing women for exercising their right to choose to end a pregnancy, and rightfully so. However, the truth is, the whole GOP agrees with Trump, but no one is talking about that. On the Thursday night edition of her show, Maddow took the rest of the press to task for ignoring the dangerous anti-woman views of almost all politicians on the right. She began: I don t know if the Beltway media sort of doesn t get this yet, or if they don t feel like reporting on it or if it s uncomfortable, or if it earns you too many enemies from people you want to be sources or friends in the future. But what we are having right now in terms of the focus of the Republican presidential race and its national media coverage right now is a farce. She reminded everyone that Ted Cruz and others are simply smart enough not to openly call for something as outrageous as punishment for abortions, and he said so at a  Women for Cruz  rally. Maddow continued:Ted Cruz is right, that the anti-abortion movement in general has learned to stop talking about that. They don t like to talk about that; they like to say that they ll never talk about that. But it is, if we re being honest here, an unavoidable consequence of what it would mean if they get their way. Maddow is right, of course. Cruz has very extreme views on abortion, and has bragged publicly about his so-called  right to life  stance. He isn t any less extreme than Trump; in fact, he may be more so, considering that he has said he d go around the Roe v. Wade decision to end abortion in America for good.Maddow s parting warning is one we all need to understand and heed:So, just a note to the national media and to the Beltway media on this subject. I know everybody s all over Donald Trump on this   what will this mean for his campaign?   but covering a story like this does not mean just writing down what people want you to say about them in the terms they want you to use. Exactly. The entire Republican Party wants to set women s rights back half a century, but nobody wants to talk about that. That is a very dangerous game to play, to ignore the facts of their positions and pretend that these other politicians are any better than the circus act that is the Donald Trump campaign.Watch the video below.

Not only that, but there s every reason to think this could land on House and Senate Republicans in 2016 as well. You can see the perfect example of it already happening in the videos below.It all started with Trump saying, during a town hall interview with Chris Matthews, that he feels there should be a punishment for women who get abortions. This is how he suggests you enforce a theoretical law that would either ban abortion altogether or punish certain abortions that happen outside of limitations like rape and incest.The backlash to this came swiftly from pro and anti-abortion advocates alike. Despite both sides disavowing it, though, the damage to Republicans has already been done. Now, Republicans other than Trump   ones who bragged hugely about how they would do everything they can to ban abortion in an effort to out-pro-life each other   are being asked a very uncomfortable question while the cameras are rolling;  What kind of punishments would you seek for women who get abortions? Here is the first of two reasons why this might be the worst thing to happen to the Republican party since Trump:.@JohnKasich reacts to Trump s abortion comments:  Of course, women shouldn t be punished  for having an abortion https://t.co/bLyaNPVGoE  MSNBC (@MSNBC) March 30, 2016Remember, John Kasich is the  grown up  in the room and he can t even answer the freakin  question properly.  How would you punish women  is not answered by  there s exceptions for rape,  unless you think literally every pregnancy is caused by rape in America, which I doubt he does. And, admitting you wouldn t punish them is going to political suicide.But wait, it gets even worse.Here is how it will go down. Republican voters finally heard a Republican presidential candidate say they would actually go after women who get abortions with criminal penalties . This is the answer to their prayers   literally. Now the smell of blood is in the air and Republicans will not take no for an answer to the question of  will you punish women who get abortions? Below is the second reason and a perfect example of the sh*tstorm that Trump has started:Trump may have single-handedly taken the entire pro-life movement to a place from where it won t easily be able to recover. Logically speaking, it s difficult to ban a thing without criminal penalties associated with violating the ban. Republican voters want sooooo badly for there to be criminal penalties for women who  murder babies  along with the doctors and whoever else they can blame for it. The logical outcome of this is obvious.In the space of one day being  pro-life  was made uncool for Republicans. Now you need to be  pro-punishment  to satisfy your rabid voter base.

The right treated Trump s declaration that under a regime where abortion is outlawed, women would have to be  punished  as if it were some crazy deviation from what the anti-choice right has been saying for years.In an interview with Business Insider, Secretary Hillary Clinton quickly dispensed with this utterly false notion.https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider/videos/10153507816369071/Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, said that Trump also revealed what many Republican lawmakers and candidates believe. She cited efforts by GOP governors and state legislatures to curb access to abortion. What s important here is that all the Republicans agree with him. They all want to see women s rights eroded and for abortion to become illegal again,  she said.  That s why so many state Republican governors and legislators are defunding Planned Parenthood and shutting down clinics that not only provide a safe abortion, but HIV testing, cancer screenings, and so much else. Clinton added,  So he tried to walk it back, but I think you have to take him at his word. The official Republican Party Platform, passed at the 2012 Republican National Convention, is very clear on abortion. The text calls for the passage of a so-called  Human Life Amendment  to the Constitution, which would classify every fetus at every stage as a full, human, life. And as a result, any sort of abortion   even for rape or incest   would count as a murder. But not only would doctors be subject to arrest, in this world view a murder could not happen without it being solicited   by the mother.The end result is, that if abortion law is enacted the way the official Republican Party platform calls for it to be, women, and possibly their spouses, would at best be considered part of a criminal conspiracy to commit murder.Usually the media allows Republicans a pass on this, rarely asking what the logical conclusions in the real world would be of an outright ban on abortion. As Secretary Clinton noted, the only mistake Trump made is in saying in front of cameras what conservative Republicans believe and talk about behind closed doors.Featured image via Facebook""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Their corporate-owned Republicans have insisted it would destroy America in any number of strange and unusual ways. Now a new study reveals why they say helping sick people afford to see a doctor is bad for the country.Data has become available for 2014 and 2015 enrollees to Blue Cross and Blue Shield, who were picked up through the Affordable Care Act s health insurance exchanges. It shows that the people who the ACA was specifically created to help are actually going to the doctor and using medical services. Huge shock, right? The entirety of the Republican and corporate establishment s opposition to the ACA resides in a single thing   money. More for them, and none for regular people. If the poor and middle class suffer and die needlessly, that s just their cost of doing business.People who got back into the insurance market, thanks to the ACA, were shown to have a 22 percent higher medical cost than those with employer-based coverage in 2015. The average monthly spending numbers for the new enrollees was $559 in 2015 compared to $457 for group members who had it through an employer. The same new enrollee segment increased from $501 in 2014 to the previously mentioned $559 in 2015.The irony of the situation is that the very corporations who are whining about having to pay the bills of sick people were the primary engineers of their own self-imposed disaster. These are the same corporations that spiked health insurance costs, causing people to be unable to afford it. They are also the same corporations that outright refused to sell people coverage, because of  pre-existing conditions.  Pre-existing conditions that could be literally anything they wanted them to be. After sometimes decades of unmanaged health issues, these new enrollees are consuming services at elevated rates. Insurers basically screwed themselves for short-term profits, and now they have to pay some of it back. Pardon me if I am less than sympathetic towards them.This shows just how desperately needed the ACA is, and how incredibly dishonest health insurers are about their business model. The fact insurance payouts rose as much as they did in as short a time is proof just how many Americans were suffering without need. That is where the darker truth of the health insurance industry comes into plain view. These companies are still wildly profitable. They just want to keep more money for themselves. Simply put, they ve become a caricature of their own greedy reputations.The tragedy of this all is that the same data showing how desperately needed the ACA is, also is being used as misinformation to completely lie to America about how bad it is for the country. The only tidbit being presented is that it is increasing costs to insurance companies, which does mean their premiums might go up. However, the overall increase in premiums is at a slower rate than before Obamacare became law, even with the increased payouts for more consumption of services.Right wingers and unscrupulous insurance companies are taking the very truth about why it is a good law, and perverting it into a lie about how it is bad by purposefully omitting all context until the  truth  is whatever they want it to be. If you add in the fact that initial expenditures are going to be higher until we catch up with decades of a lack of care, you can argue a case that premiums would have actually dropped if all other things were equal, due to massive amounts of new customers spreading out the cost burden.As more new data becomes available, and initial over-consumption tapers off, the last arguments to be made against the law will ultimately boil down to profit over people. If anything will prove how obsolete the American health insurance industry is, and why single-payer is needed, that will be it.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But that is exactly what is happening since Pence and Republicans made a new law banning abortion based on race or gender, requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals, and forces doctors  to provide information about perinatal hospice care to a pregnant woman who is considering an abortion because the unborn child has been diagnosed with a lethal fetal anomaly. In other words, women considering an abortion will be lectured by their doctor after being informed about any lethal fetal anomaly. Once a woman is informed of such an anomaly, she will no longer be able to get an abortion because the new law prohibits abortions in such cases. That means women are going to be forced to carry fetuses with anomalies to term, regardless of viability, which means women could end up giving birth to babies that will suffer and die soon after being born.In response to this latest attack on a woman s right to choose, women are actually calling in to inform Governor Pence of their reproductive cycle status and the phone conversations are comedy gold. I need to get a message to the Governor that I am on day three of my period. My flow seems abnormally heavy, but my cramps are much better to  she tells the person who answered before being interrupted. Ma am, what is it that I can help you with?  the person asks. Oh, I don t need your help, I just wanted to keep Governor Pence informed of my reproductive cycle, since he seems so concerned,  the woman replied.The phone calls are the result of a call-to-action campaign led by a group known as  Periods for Pence,  which seeks to give women a voice in the state since Pence and Republicans didn t really consider what women think before imposing their anti-abortion agenda on all women in Indiana. The more I read this bill, the more vague language I found and the more loopholes, and it just seemed incredibly intrusive,  the creator of the campaign told WRTV.  So I wanted to give a voice for women who really didn t feel like they were given any kind of input into a bill that would affect our life so much. The campaign s Facebook page even generously provided the number to reach the Governor s Office, which is 317-232-4567, for those of you who want to know, and women started calling the number to keep Pence updated on what s going on with their uterus since Pence and the GOP want to know so desperately. And it led to the call above and this one: Good Morning,  a woman said upon reaching the Governor s office.  I just wanted to inform the Governor that things seem to be drying up today. No babies seem to be up in there. Okay? Upon being asked her name, the woman replied that her name is Sue Magina.  That s M-A-G-I-N-A. It rhymes with  she said before being cut off.Here s the video:Yeah, this campaign is perfect and I m sure Governor Pence is super-stoked about receiving constant updates on what s going on with women s reproductive cycles. So women should definitely call him and make sure to provide as many details as possible.

Candidates need a majority of the 538 electoral votes in the United States to win, currently that number is 270.Sabato notes: Election analysts prefer close elections, but there was nothing we could do to make this one close. The predicted map looks very similar to 2012 s electoral map, but with North Carolina flipping from Republican to Democrat. In 2012, Mitt Romney won North Carolina, but just by 2.2%.Sabato also predicts a close race in other states that were previously Republican territory: Arizona, Missouri, Indiana, and Georgia. Notably, President Obama won Indiana in 2008, and the large black population in Georgia has had many thinking it could soon become a swing state.Addressing the storyline that has surfaced in the media, that Trump could appeal to blue-collar voters in some states and flip Democratic votes, Sabato throws cold water on the idea:Trump supporters and some independent analysts assert that his appeal to many blue-collar whites in Rust Belt states (such as Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) could pull these states  electoral votes into the Republican column. The problem is, there is little evidence that the non-college voters supporting Trump in the primaries are defectors from the Democrats; most have been backing GOP candidates fairly consistently, so the net addition for Trump could be small.Sabato is no random crank or egghead. His  Crystal Ball  forecasts are highly cited and in the past he accurately predicted the results of the 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 elections within a few electoral votes or Senate/House races.In 2006 on MSNBC, anchor Lester Holt told Sabato, he  predicted Democrats would pick up the six seats needed to take over the Senate.

In an explosive story first broken by TIME, Republican officials in South Carolina floated the idea that Trump may have given away his landslide victory in the state by brashly announcing that he would no longer adhere to the  Loyalty Pledge  if he didn t get the nomination.South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore gave credence to the anti-Trump claims. Breaking South Carolina s presidential primary ballot pledge raises some unanswered legal questions that no one person can answer,  he told TIME.  However, a court or national convention Committee on Contests could resolve them. It could put delegates in jeopardy. What does this mean for Trump? The 50 delegates he won in South Carolina could simply walk away   and over to his opponents. That sends his delegate count a lot further away from the crucial 1,237 finish line, and maybe give his opponents the push they need to realistically challenge him at a brokered convention. And adding to the problem: Other states which include the loyalty pledge in their bylaws could also move to strip Trump of his delegates.All of this to say, Trump s massive ego is costing him the election. Having early on floated the idea that he wouldn t support a Republican candidate if it wasn t himself, Trump eventually caved and signed a document stating: I, Donald J. Trump, affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for President of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican nominee regardless of who it is. Suddenly, with opposition to his nomination mounting, Trump has returned to saying he will not adhere to that pledge, telling Anderson Cooper matter-of-factly:  No. I don t anymore,  arguing that he s been treated unfairly by the GOP.Trump has repeatedly ignored conventional wisdom and used his gut to direct his campaign   early on, Trump s campaign manager told staffers that the motto of the campaign would be  Let Trump Be Trump    and while it often works to his advantage (who would have thought calling John McCain a loser for being a POW would pay off?), his increasingly erratic behavior makes him a ticking time bomb. Cracks are beginning to emerge. His polls are tanking and there are signs that the  anti-Trump  members of the Republican Party are finally coalescing around his chief rival, Ted Cruz. He may have enough momentum to get the nod, but needlessly handing away delegates isn t doing him any favors.In the end there was only one serious contender against Trump and that was himself. For all of his arrogance, it is fitting that his own misplaced hubris would be the one thing that got the better of him. Having run as an outsider for his entire campaign, Trump is learning that bashing the party you plan to run for isn t welcomed with open arms.

After the President used the word  n*gger  while speaking about how racism is still an issue in our society, Nugent wrote: Well, there you have it. The Honest Society is a rather large and growing club, clan if you will, that is not afraid of speaking honestly without fear of politically correct word nazi s going berserk. Nugent proclaimed that the use of  n-word  in place of the full thing is the  epitome of political correctness gone mad,  going on to explain that  the word n*gger has historically been used in a powerfully positive way  in some scenarios. He went on to proclaim that society shunning the word  n*gger  does nothing to help the  criminality  of  blacks  in Chicago and  other urban hellzones.  Besides, he says, black people use the word and it is  the very definition of racism  not to let white people spew it as much as they want with no repercussions.Nugent once adopted a 17-year-old girl so that he could have sex with her.

Now,  religious freedom  is actually code for  freedom to discriminate against gay people  as it once was  freedom to discriminate against black people  not too long ago.The state of Mississippi just passed one of the most discriminatory bills yet, but titled it  Religious Liberty Accommodations Act.  Which, is pretty accurate considering the state is trying to accommodate religious bigots and their discrimination. The bill HB 1523 has yet to be signed by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant, but knowing his  religious liberty  history, he ll undoubtedly put pen to paper.Now, the bill itself is pretty damn blunt in its hatred towards the LGBT community. It states: The Mississippi Legislature finds the following:(a) Leading legal scholars concur that conflicts between same-sex marriage and religious liberty are real and should be addressed through legislation;(b) After the legalization of same-sex marriage, religious adoption and foster care agencies in Massachusetts, Illinois and the District of Columbia were forced to close because of their sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage etc. etc. First of all, who are these asshole  legal scholars  who clearly got their degree at Liberty  University  or somewhere similar.What is pretty damn interesting is the fact that the bill doesn t only attack the rights of the LGBT community, it also goes after heterosexual couples who aren t married yet. It stipulates that sex should only be between a man and a woman after marriage. The sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions protected by this act are the belief or conviction that:(a) Marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman;(b) Sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage; and(c) Male (man) or female (woman) refer to an individual s immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth. Yikes! There goes any and all premarital sex. I wonder how heterosexual people will feel with government entering into their bedrooms. So much for being anti-big government. This pretty much takes the cake on an infringement of personal rights all across the board. Not only does is purposefully discriminate against the LGBT community by taking away equal access, it also infringes upon the freedom of straight people to have sex before marriage.Last time I checked, the Bible isn t the Constitution, but hey .  religious freedom  amiright?!Featured Photo by M.

It s a good argument;  electability  and all that, but it s not true. Even slightly. In fact, never mind Hillary, we could nominate a potted plant on the left and Trump would STILL lose.How can I be so sure? Easy: Trump has to win 70% of the white male vote to become president.Good fucking luck with that.I know what you re thinking: Trump appeals directly to white resentment, how could he not have the angry white male vote totally locked up? Honestly, he probably does. This is something that, as a white male myself, I find incredibly annoying. That more than half of all white males would support such a piece of trash is embarrassing to say the least. But more than half is not the same as 70%.No one gets 70% of the white male vote. No. One.That s a larger percentage than Republicans have ever won before   more than the GOP won in the landslide victories of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and far more than they won during the racially polarized elections of Barack Obama.Of course, the argument often made by Trump s followers is that he will win in November because he will bring so many disengaged Americans to the polls. But they re talking about disengaged white voters, mostly mostly men   and unfortunately for him, the turnout rate for white men is already relatively high. Got that? Even when White America went completely insane at the idea of a black president, they STILL couldn t muster more than the 63% Reagan and Poppy Bush took in 1980 and 1988 or the 62% Dubya got in 2004. More importantly, as the country gets less lily white, even that 60%+ is losing its punch:By 2004, however, winning 62 percent of white men barely got George W. Bush past John Kerry in a squeaker. And eight years later, Romney won 62 percent of white men and lost to Barack Obama by 3.5 million votes.So what happened? Between Reagan and Romney, the white male share of the total vote had dropped from 45 percent to 35 percent.Ironically, the very thing Trump is harnessing to propel his campaign, white resentment at the waning of white supremacy, is what will ensure he can never win. It s such a thing a beauty that I want to redefine marriage again so I can walk it down the aisle.If you want a full breakdown of why Trump needs 70% of white men and how women, Latinos and black voters spell his doom, take a look at Politico s excellent analysis.Featured image via AI archives ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Every parent has heard a kid say that about another kid,  Cooper said, as Trump clearly looked embarrassed. Yet cartoon Trump found a way yo defend himself.Then there was his defense of Corey Lewandowski s alleged assault on a female reporter.  She had a pen,  Donald said.  It could have been a bomb.

Several times during his interview with MSNBC, and Camerota pointed that out by repeating his exact words: He said,  I would ban it.  Katrina, You are mincing words here. Pierson responded: This is a misspeak, Alisyn. No Alisyn, there was a misspeak here, and you have a presidential candidate that clarified the record. Not once, but twice. Although he did  clarify  his abortion position, his clarification was just as,  confusing. First, he said it should be up to the state. Then he said At this point Pierson completely lost it, cutting the host off, she shouted: No, they weren t confusing! Because the first thing was about a ban. That s correct and that s correct, it should be down to the states because that s what the potential ban was talking about. Unfazed by her anger, the CNN host continued to repeat Trump s words back to her, demolishing her  it was about the states  talking point. She also muses that it is a  window  into Trump s mind and asks the spokeswoman if he has even bothered to sit down with policy advisors and discuss this issue. After about a minute of back and forth with the CNN host refusing to let Pierson glass over the fact that he said women should be punished if they terminate a pregnancy, the Trump puppet repeated: It was a misspeak! How many times do I have to say that? This was a complete misspeak during a conversation over a hypothetical concept and there was a clarification issue.

While the majority of Muslims would be blocked regardless of circumstance, his  very rich Muslim friends  (i.e. the ones he has business deals with) can get a pass. He trusts them   because they make him money. I have actually believe it or not, I have a lot of friends that are Muslim and they call me,  Trump said, when asked about his plan by MSNBC s Chris Matthews, the event s moderator.  In most cases, they re very rich Muslims, OK? Matthews then asked Trump if his rich Muslim friends would be able enter the country under Trump s Muslim ban.  They ll come in,  Trump said.  You ll have exceptions. Trump has often brought up his  Muslim friends  who he routinely claims call him non-stop to tell him what a great job he s doing at being xenophobic towards Muslims. It might be tempting to claim that these Muslims are fictions of his imagination, a cheap talking point to justify his reprehensible plans for very real Muslims. However, it appears he really does have a few Muslim friends, but not exactly salt-of-the-earth types. He means autocrats in Middle Eastern nations. As the Daily Beast wrote about in late 2015:There s one type of Muslim Trump really loves: The ones that make him big bucks. You see, if a Muslim can show Trump the money, then all those concerns he has with Muslims go right out the window of his private jet as he jets off to the Gulf to cash in.For example, Trump loves Hussain Sajwani, head of the Dubai luxury real estate company Damac Properties. Trump has called the Muslim Sajwani a  good friend  and a  great man,  among other accolades. And in May 2014, The Donald even flew off to Dubai to spend time with his Muslim friend as they announced the massive real estate project they were teaming up to create in the United Arab Emirates.Trump, of course, has no qualms with working with Muslims if they can make his bank account grow. Suddenly, the people whose faith he thinks is hellbent on destroying America, aren t so bad. This duality makes his bigotry that much worse   he s really not that committed to it. Like any good hate-monger, Trump scapegoats Muslims to rile up his deeply anti-Muslim base. It s led to vicious hate crimes against innocent Muslim Americans, including assaults and arson. It s also led to Trump s surge in the polls. But underlying the smears and falsehoods, is a calculated stab at winning an election via exploitation of fear and hate.So of course he would let his  very rich Muslim friends  in.

All I could think was,  But that s what Republicans have been trying to do for years! Why are people shocked? Apparently, I m not the only person to have noticed that:Planned Parenthood Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said presidential candidate Donald Trump had exposed the real views of many Republicans. A plan to punish women who seek abortion in this country is not news, it s actually the Republican Party platform  they re horrified to have been outed for what they do every day, which is punish women who seek abortions. To back laws that tell doctors they must lie to women, to work to shut down clinics, to ban certain procedures that doctors say are important for women s safety and health,  she said Thursday morning during an appearance on CNN.  I mean, all of these things. That s what their agenda is day in and day out. They do punish women. Yeah, pretty much. But it s worse than that. Republicans have proposed laws that would make it legal to kill abortion providers. They ve criminalized pregnancy in several states which has resulting in a growing trend of women being arrested for miscarrying. The idea of punishing women is not at all a new idea for Republicans. Laguens is exactly right when she says the problem other Republicans have is that Trump is saying it out loud.This has been the main objection to Trump from the GOP the entire time. He s not sophisticated enough to use dog whistles or anything resembling subtlety. He just says what Republicans actually think and want without the veil of respectability they ve built. While it excites a base that s tired of being unable to wear their racism on their sleeve (or their pointy white hood), it s made moderate Republicans and Independents recoil in disgust.As long as Trump continues to expose the core of Republican ideology to the world, he s an enormous threat to their agenda and he s primed to not just lose in November, but lose BIG.Keep up the good work, Donald!Featured image via Getty""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Senate Republicans were just taken to the woodshed by a historian for their unprecedented obstruction of President Obama s Supreme Court nominee.Ever since Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Republicans have used every excuse they can think of to justify their refusal to even consider anyone President Obama picks to fill the vacancy.And in response to an op-ed written by GOP Senator Orrin Hatch in which he lists several of those excuses, a historian fired back with an op-ed of his own completely burying each and every one of them.When Hatch suggested the rules are different when replacing one of  the greatest jurists in our nation s history,  Wofford College Professor Mark S. Byrnes replied,  it does not matter who the president is replacing. All openings on the Court are created equal. And frankly, Scalia was one of the worst Supreme Court Justices this country has ever had the misfortune to witness. He was easily swayed in his decisions by gifts from those who wanted him to rule a certain way and many of his dissents are nothing more than glorified temper tantrums that had little to do with constitutional interpretation and more to do with failing to force another aspect of the right-wing agenda down our throats.Byrnes then scorched Hatch for accusing President Obama of disagreeing with Scalia s philosophy and reminded him that,  When the electorate once again decisively elected Obama as president in 2012, it did not include an asterisk that said he could only replace justices with whom he agreed. Indeed, if that were the case we wouldn t have Clarence Thomas on the bench because former President George H. W. Bush would have had to nominate someone with a liberal philosophy similar to Justice Thurgood Marshall, whom Thomas replaced, to the high court.Hatch also complained about President Obama opposing two nominees of former President George W. Bush as a senator and claimed Obama has repeatedly exceeded constitutional authority. Byrnes slapped those two excuses down by noting that at least Bush s nominees received a vote and that if Republicans really believed Obama has done something wrong they would have drawn up articles of impeachment by now.Hatch also pointed out that Americans chose a Democratic president and a Republican Senate, but that was easily countered as well as Byrnes noted that Obama nominated centrist Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.  He did not chose someone who was a darling of the Democratic left, but someone who has (in the past) been repeatedly praised by Republicans, including Hatch himself,  Byrnes noted.Byrnes then lambasted Hatch for getting American history wrong.Hatch claimed in his op-ed that,  Throughout its history, the Senate has never confirmed a nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy that occurred this late in a term-limited president s time in office. And Bynes really handed Hatch his ass on this claim.As a history teacher, I am used to the instinct unprepared undergraduates have to bolster a poor argument with the  throughout history  trick. I expect better of United States Senators.Hatch shows his contempt for his readers with this tortured construction. To make his  throughout its history  line work, Hatch needs to make that history awfully short. He does that with the phrase  term-limited.  The 22nd Amendment, which imposes term limits on presidents, has only been in effect for 65 years. So this particular  throughout its history  means for 65 years less than Hatch s own life span.Bynres goes on to note that  there has only been one other vacancy during that period that was  this late  in a president s term: LBJ s nomination of Abe Fortas in 1968. Yes, Fortas was not confirmed as Chief Justice. That nomination received a hearing, however, and a vote. It was not met with this disingenuous nonsense that  we never do this.  And as Hatch well knows, 1968 was one of the most contentious elections years in American history. Somehow, the Senate still did its job.Byrnes also blasted Hatch for using how nasty the current election has been as an excuse to not do his job because only Republicans have made the election nasty thus far. And when Hatch claimed that both parties have politicized the confirmation process, Byrnes observed that only Republicans are escalating the politicization to an unprecedented height this time around.In his conclusion, Byrnes urged Republicans to stop acting like  cowards  and stop pretending that their obstruction is about something more than just trying to keep the Supreme Court conservative.If Hatch and his fellow Republicans want to vote against Judge Garland, they have every right to do so. But they should stop being cowards. They should make a substantive argument against him. vote against him, and accept the political consequences of that vote. They should stop pretending that this reckless path they have chosen is anything but a desperate attempt to hold onto a Supreme Court majority.Seriously, Senate Republicans need to stop with the excuses and do their job. They have thrown their little temper tantrum and they have lost the argument repeatedly. Every excuse they have offered has literally been destroyed by facts and historical evidence. They need to get over it and get the Court back to full capacity or the American people will have another real excuse to boot them out of office in November.Featured image: Cagle""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In a show that aired on Wednesday night, Maddow invited Sanders to comment on Trump s comments to fellow MSNBC host Chris Matthews that there  should be some kind of punishment  for women who have abortions. Sanders recoiled at the comments, stating unequivocally: Shameful is understating that position. First of all, to me, and most Americans, women have the right to control their own bodies. But to punish a woman, for having an abortion, is beyond comprehension. One would have to say: what is on Donald Trump s mind? I don t know what world this person lives in. The interview continues with Sanders crushing each pillar of the Republican race, one after another. Until finally, Maddow asks Sanders how he feels about the GOP seeming to split, with the potential for the convention to refuse to endorse the winner of the Primaries. It s worth seeing Sander s full reply, which absolutely nails the crisis at the heart of the GOP and conservative media today: Well, uh, first of all, I don t necessarily take at value   face value what they say.  I think at the end of the day, they probably will come together.But the other point, I think the more   the deeper point, Rachel, is the Republican Party today has moved very, very far to the right.  Uh, they are way out of touch with where the American people are.And I think if we had a media in this country that was really prepared to look at what the Republicans actually stood for rather than quoting every absurd remark of Donald Trump, talking about Republican Party, talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the top two tenths of 1 percent, cuts to Social Security and Medicare, Medicaid, a party which with few exceptions, doesn t even acknowledge the reality of climate change, let alone do anything about it, a party which is not prepared to stand with women in the fight for pay equity, a party that is not prepared to do anything about a broken criminal justice system or a corrupt campaign finance system, I think, to be honest with you   and I just don t, you know, say this rhetorically, this is a fringe party.  It is a fringe party.  Maybe they get 5, 10 percent of the vote.What you really need in this country is a progressive party standing with the working class and the middle class of this country.  And yes, a conservative party that, you know, has, you know, is more fiscally conservative.  That is where we should be as a country.But the Republican Party today now is a joke, maintained by a media which really does not force them to discuss their issues.So that   that s my two cents on that. The Republican Party is in crisis. It s candidates have pulled so far to the right that even Ann Coulter is having a wobble, and it s hard to see how they could possibly gain the support of the wider American public in time for Election 2016.While the candidates  daily horrifying comments might be making lots of front page news, they would be foolish to expect this press attention to turn into votes   at least, not for them.

He told Matthews Wednesday that  you d be a bad negotiator  for taking any strategy off the table.Trump s comments ironically echo the sentiments of 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, who is considered the first person in the mold of a modern conservative to be a major party nominee in America.In an interview, Goldwater said he would consider the use of low-yield atomic bombs in North Vietnam, in order to defoliate forests, and to destroy bridges and railroad lines leading to China. The policy was so extreme and out there, that it became the basis of what is one of the most famous political ads ever,  Daisy,  released by Lyndon Johnson s campaign. The ad contrasted Goldwater s casual support of atomic war versus the policies of the Johnson administration.The ad only aired once.

Only a few days after Chief Israeli Sephardi Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef said that non-Jews should not live in Israel unless they  serve Jews, another influential Israeli racist has come out publicly, in this case to incite against Palestinians and their supporters. Transportation minister Israel Katz called for the  civil targeted killing of non-violent civil rights leaders who call for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of Israel until it conforms to international law.Here is what author Richard Silverstein had to say about Katz s statement, made in Hebrew: The phrase he used (sikul ezrahi memukad) derives from the euphemistic Hebrew phrase for the targeted killing of a terrorist (the literal meaning is  targeted thwarting ).  But the added word  civil  makes it something different. Katz is saying that we won t physically murder BDS opponents, but we will do everything short of that. One may rightly ask what business a transportation minister has conducting targeted killings, physical or otherwise, against anyone.  Though everything in Israel is in service to the national security state, has transportation fallen under that bailiwick as well? We are entering dangerous territory when an Israeli cabinet minister engages in wordplay that verges on putting a bull s-eye on the backs of non-violent activists.  If there are Israel apologists out there who dismiss the significance of such rhetoric they are sadly mistaken.  In this torrid political environment in which Israeli leftists have become criminals and wounded Palestinian youth may be summarily executed in the street,  it is only too easy to forsee Palestinian activists like Barghouti (BDS leader) having a bounty on their heads. In addition, BDS activists this psychopath is inciting against are not just Palestinian: They are from all over the world, including the United States. In fact, American activists are at the forefront of the BDS movement. Moreover, we want to keep in mind the life and death power Israel has over the Palestinian people. It has become the norm not only to incite against Palestinians but to kill them in cold blood. Only a few days ago, an injured Palestinian who was incapacitated and lying on the ground was murdered by an Israeli soldier (you can watch the video below). Many Israelis consider the soldier a hero and are calling for his release.Israel s life and death stranglehold over millions of Palestinians makes statements like Katz s even more dangerous because many Israeli Jews do not see Palestinians as humans. After all, Israelis were lounging in chairs on hilltops and cheering as thousands of civilians were being killed in Gaza in the summer of 2014. Israeli politicians have a long history of frightening language against Palestinians. Whether it is Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked s reference to Palestinian children as snakes, or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s continuous incitement, Katz s statement is just the latest round of Israeli politicians tripping over each other to dehumanize Palestinians.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Bl9zAM5A4] Featured image via video screenshot.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In an interview published on Wednesday, Billboard asked Biden how he felt about Trump by posing the question, Do you ever hear Donald Trump speak and think,  Boy, I would love to debate that guy ?

Billboard s interview with the Vice President was focused around his legacy of ending violence against women and sexual assaults on school campuses around the country. Biden, who (along with Obama) has been heavily involved in initiatives to bring awareness around this cause (such as the launch of the It s On Us campaign in 2014), and said he found it disconcerting to see Trump encouraging his supporters to be aggressive. Of Trump s habit of egging violent behavior on, Biden said: It not only undermines the work that President Obama and I have done   it undermines the work a majority of Republicans and Democrats have done. It is the antithesis of everything this country is about.

At the American Israel Public Affairs Committee s policy conference earlier this month, Biden also took on Trump s anti-Israel comments and slammed the business mogul for targeting religious groups and minorities.

Mike Moon declared that since he was once an embryo that means he is a qualified reproductive health expert who knows what he is talking about when it comes to abortion and whether or not an embryo is a person.And yes, people laughed at him.The hearing was about House Joint Resolution 98, which would ban abortion in the state by enshrining the right to life of  unborn human children at every stage of biological development  in the Missouri Constitution.According to the Columbia Missourian, Moon  opened the hearing by showing a video of an unborn fetus on a display monitor. The fetus was developed enough to make out undeniably human characteristics, such as hands and a face. A precious sight, I think most of us would agree,  Moon declared.  The more you look at that, the more you have to realize that that is a human being. Moon went on to compare abortion to slavery before making more of an ass of himself by concluding,  As a former embryo myself, I would like protection for all embryos.  After the laughter died down, a real health expert testified against the resolution.St, Louis physician Ed Weisbart said there is no scientific consensus for when life begins and that women should have the final choice to end their pregnancy or not.Meanwhile, the United States Constitution, which supersedes state law, says plainly in the 14th Amendment that only  all persons born  are granted citizenship under the jurisdiction of the United States.In other words, the Constitution does not consider unborn fetuses as persons under the law.Plus, banning abortion would take away the fundamental rights of due process and equal protection from women, which is unconstitutional.Not only would the Supreme Court be duty-bound to overturn HJR 98, it would cost Missouri taxpayers millions of dollars to fund a losing cause.And if Missouri conservatives really want to continue to argue, they should consider that even their Bible does not consider fetuses to be persons.Also, being an embryo at one time does not make anyone an expert on reproductive issues. It s like saying you re an expert pastry chef because you once made mud pies as a child. That just doesn t fly.The bottom line is that women should have the choice and Republicans need to back off and stop trying to force their religious beliefs down their throats, especially when those beliefs contradict what their Bibles actually say. But the Bible shouldn t matter anyway because the Constitution has already clearly defined personhood and it starts at birth.Featured Image: Imgur""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

McAuliffe vetoed the Virginia bill during a radio appearance. It s unconstitutional, it is discriminatory,  he said on WTOP.  It demonizes folks. It brings fear and persecution. We can t tolerate that. In North Carolina businesses are pushing back against the law, and McAuliffe said the Virginia bill would have hurt his efforts to grow the economy. We need Virginia to be open and welcoming to everyone,  he said.Republican legislatures have been pushing a series of these bills all over the country in a desperate bid to undo the Supreme Court s ruling on marriage equality. The problem is that Corporate America understands that the culture war against homosexuality is lost and doing business in states that pass these laws hurts their bottom line. The pressure they apply to Republican governors is enormous and they re capitulating, much to the extreme displeasure of the right wing.In the case of Gov. McAuliffe, he s simply being a decent human being, an alien concept to Republicans.Just to reiterate, elections matter. McAuliffe ran against Ken Cuccinelli in 2013.

It would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security.The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in Mississippi, expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse, satchel or briefcase, and another recent law that allows open carry in public.The bill also seeks to prohibit Mississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or executive orders that would violate the state constitution   an attempt to federal gun restrictions not passed by Congress.Mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as  security  which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of  justifiable homicide    the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty.@pourmecoffee It passed pic.twitter.com/H8WvOdHFA4  pourmecoffee (@pourmecoffee) March 30, 2016What could go wrong?Much of this baffling new legislation is in direct response to NRA lobbying directives to erode existing gun laws in order to create a  polite  society of heavily-armed citizens. Exploiting tragedy (and ignoring irony) the NRA has used recent mass shootings to push for more guns, not less. The narrative goes that if only churches would have access to firearms, shootings like the one in Charleston, South Carolina, could be prevented.The premise, as tempting as it sounds for would-be vigilantes, has been thoroughly debunked both in theory and in practice. Data suggests that as the number of guns increase, the risk of someone being shot by those guns also increases. Places with a lot of  good guys with guns  tend to have higher incidences of gun injuries. Go figure. At the same time, anecdotal evidence supports these warnings as well. We ve seen that guns in churches often lead to disastrous accidents, while at the same time not once stopping a mass shooting in a house of worship.With the removal of even permit requirements, Mississippi is planning on handing over the power of life and death to a bunch of untrained, untested amateurs who won t even have the risk of prosecution keeping their index finger off the trigger. A militarized church security unit assigned by the church, trained by the church, and meant to protect the church by any means necessary.

Claiming that he has gay friends and friends who were former homosexuals, Gruenhagen fretted about the number of Americans who have an STD in this country, which the Centers for Disease Control says is about one-third of the population.Hartman then sought clarification. You are telling the millions of people in this country who are homosexual   and the rest of their lives are no different than me or yours   but that the reason they have described themselves as homosexual is because they have an unhealthy sexual addiction?  Hartman asked.After being given a chance to reverse himself, Gruenhagen didn t backtrack. Yeah,  he replied.  You can go on the Internet and there s treatment for sexual addictions right here in Minnesota, whether it s pornography or unhealthy sexual behavior. You can receive treatment for that and be free from those compulsions. Here s the audio via Raw Story.What Gruenhagen is likely talking about is dangerous conversion therapy which can cause lasting psychological damage and even be fatal. That s why it is opposed by the American Psychological Association.But Gruenhagen isn t just attacking gay people, he also thinks being transgender is a mental illness, too, and he has sponsored a bill in the Minnesota statehouse that would force them to use bathrooms corresponding to their  biological sex.  Such bills have been popular with Republicans as of late, with North Carolina being the latest red state to embarrass themselves with such a law on the books.Gruenhagen s proof that LGBT people have a mental illness comes from outdated versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which was updated in 1973 and 2012 to declare that being gay or trans is no longer considered a mental disorder.Republicans really need to stop being so obsessed with gay sex and it makes one wonder what Gruenhagen is hiding in his closet. After all, the lawmakers who fight homosexuality the most usually seem to be those who have homosexual attractions themselves.

However, Cooper wasn t having it, responding,  Sounds like you were engaged in a lovefest. There are many reasons why the slippery Cruz wanted to keep all of his options open regarding a potential Trump win. Cruz, never a man with a moral compass, not only didn t go on the attack against Trump, he also embraced some of Trump s racist and nasty policies, including those on Muslims and immigrants.If you look closely, there isn t much of a difference between the two except Trump has a bigger mouth, but since Cruz is an ideologue and actually believes the stupid things that come out of his mouth, it makes him more dangerous.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WpO24C8I6Y]Featured Image via video screenshot.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

During one of his interviews with Good Morning America, though, he took it a step further and threatened to file charges on Michelle Fields, the reporter Lewandowski is charged with assaulting, because she  touched  Trump s arm.The hosts asked Trump if it was clear to him, after watching the video, that his campaign manager did touch Fields, even though he has insisted that he didn t. Trump responded: Well, what s clear is that she was touching me and she broke through the Secret Service. And she was asking me questions when there were no questions we were leaving, the press conference was over. She broke through, she grabbed my arm, I think a couple of times. You see me trying to get her hand off my arm and he saw something and did very minor..Her face wasn t that of a woman screaming in pain He didn t try to throw her to the ground. You look at Twitter, people think it s a total disgrace she s filing charges. I would just like to point out that this is typical abuser behavior. Instead of Trump admitting that his campaign manager was wrong and he should have kept his hands off of this woman, he is trying to place the blame squarely on her shoulders. It s like when an abusive husband punches his wife in the face, then he and his buddies say, Well, you shouldn t have mouthed off. After the long rant about how Fields was to blame for Lewandowski s actions, Trump said: I m sure there will be a counter-claim coming down the line. Should I file charges against her because she touched my arm as well? His campaign manager did NOT just  touch her arm.  He grabbed her so hard that she was left with bruises, that is not  minor,  it is battery and that s why he was charged with a crime. Clearly the police believed that he assaulted this reporter and it is disgusting the Trump is defending him. However, this is what we have come to expect from the Republican frontrunner. He and his campaign have zero respect for anybody, especially not women.Watch the interview:https://www.facebook.com/GoodMorningAmerica/videos/vb.59306617060/10153518346397061/?type=2&theaterFeatured image via video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But, as Donald Trump has proven time and again, he is not a smart candidate. Instead of firing Corey Lewandowski, he called into all of the morning shows and defended him on Wednesday. Unfortunately for him, his interview on TODAY went downhill quickly as he was met with fierce opposition from the hosts.Host Savannah Guthrie dispensed of pleasantries and immediately asked Trump is he would acknowledge that his campaign manager lied when he said he  never touched  reporter Michelle Fields. The billionaire immediately started making excuses for Lewandowski. Guthrie cut him off and said: He said he didn t touch her and the video shows he touched her. Is that not a lie? The Republican frontrunner responded, I really don t know.  It s not all that surprising that a man who lies more than three-quarters of the time can t tell when someone else is being untruthful. But then he had the audacity to say: She made up this story, Savannah. If Fields made up the story, why has his campaign manager been charged with a crime? Clearly Trump is grasping at straws.After some more back and forth with Guthrie, Trump asked host Matt Lauer if he was going to  destroy a man s life after what happened?  Lauer didn t rise to the bait, he said: Right after this incident, Corey Lewandowski tweeted that he was calling bull-blank on Ms.Fields. He tweeted that she was delusional and he tweeted that he never touched her. The video tape easily and plainly shows that, in fact, he did grab her and did pull her. Whether you want to debate whether she almost fell down or not, he didn t tell the truth. If you re President of the United States and a member of your staff, your chief of staff, goes to the American people and publicly doesn t tell the truth in the way that Corey Lewandowski hasn t told the truth, would you put up with it? Trump responds by saying  it was so minor  that his campaign manager probably didn t even know it happened. SERIOUSLY? At that point you can hear Trump clearly getting annoyed that the hosts would not allow him to get his talking points out. When Lauer says they will have to  agree to disagree  and attempts to end the interview, the Republican got really nasty and again accused the media of trying to ruin a great man.If this is his idea of a good man, I d hate to see who he thinks is bad.Watch the explosive interview below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Prior to moving to the area, her asthma was a footnote in her life, and since, it has become the headline. She suffers multiple crippling attacks a week, and her lungs feel constantly under assault by the toxic air about her. Air which, Schlanger writes, has to be breathed to be believed: As I drove east from the Detroit airport into River Rouge,  she writes,  the acrid stench of rotten eggs filled my rental car despite the windows being rolled up against the cold. I kept driving, and the smell acquired notes of burnt plastic and gasoline. If I had been anywhere else, I d have worried that my car was about to burst into flames. But I was in River Rouge, so I knew better. I pulled into a gas station. As soon as I opened my car door, I could feel the air in the back of my throat like a fine spray of gravel.It s dirty in River Rouge, and everybody here knows it. The way the air smells, and the gas flares, coal piles and smokestacks around every corner don t let you forget. There are 52 sites of heavy industry within a 3-mile radius; 22 of these either produce over 25,000 pounds or handle more than 10,000 pounds of toxic chemical waste, putting them on the Environmental Protection Agency s Toxics Release Inventory Program. For years, the area has also been  out of compliance  for sulfur dioxide, meaning there s more SO 2  a known contributor to asthma in the air than federal rules allow.As with the water crisis in Flint, Michigan is failing to protect its citizens from harm by native industries. Polluting corporations are making the area uninhabitable, while the state stands idly by. As Schlanger uncovered:According to the latest state data, more than 15 percent of Detroit s adults have asthma, a 29 percent higher rate than the rest of Michigan. Detroiters are hospitalized for their asthma three times more frequently than other Michiganders. Being black ups the rate significantly: Black Detroiters are hospitalized for asthma at a rate more than 150 percent that of their white neighborsThese citizens pay their taxes, their mortgages and their rents to live in a place so polluted that people are becoming ill and dying.This is yet another life-critical failure to be added to the expanding list of Michigan s Republican Governor Rick Snyder   who now faces a recall petition by Michigan residents who have been made, quite literally sick, by his ultra-right wing policies. The petition has 60 days to gather 790,000 signatures to begin the process of ridding the state of perhaps the worst Governor in its history. Author of the petition, Rev. David Bullock of Detroit s Greater St. Matthew Baptist Church told WJBK: It s not about Democrats. This is not about Republicans. It s not about whites or blacks. It s not about rich or poor. You have all kinds of folks   rural citizens, urban citizens, people of faith, people who are atheist, [of varying] sexual orientation   we ve got everybody. And you have to ask yourself this question: When everybody agrees, what does that mean? I think that means Rick Snyder s got to go. Let s hope Snyder goes quickly, and the process of repairing the broken state of Michigan can begin in earnest. People s lives and livelihoods depend on it.You can watch a local news report from earlier this year about an increase in emissions from a Detroit factory, and the battle of locals to try to protect themselves and their families.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

However, considering all of the sexist, misogynistic comments that Trump has said to and about women, most of us would imagine that most Trump fans are white males. According to a recent study, Trump isn t liked by 70% of American women because of his vulgar attitude toward them  and the other 30%? Well, you re about to see some of them.CNN s Martin Savidge had the opportunity to interview a few Arizona conservative women who were fierce Trump supporters, and what the interview revealed is truly depressing and baffling. It turns out, that no matter how disrespectful and degrading Trump is to them, there are still women who will not only continue to support him, but DEFEND him at all costs.One awful example of this was when Savidge brought up Fox s Megyn Kelly, whom Trump had brutally attacked on social media and made several sexist remarks about just because she called him out on his misogynistic behavior. One of the women being interviewed said Trump was completely justified in his bullying antics and said that Kelly was guilty of  baiting him.  Another women jumped in and said,  You don t know what his connotation was!  when Trump s crude reference to Kelly menstruating was brought up. Basically the group s justification for supporting Trump despite his attacks on women was: Because he insults men as well. I can t be upset that he insults women. The terrifying thing is that this group of women aren t the  uneducated  voters that Americans and Trump himself believes are supporting him. These are professional, educated women who have chosen to believe in a man who has violated basically everything they believe in.One of the women, who is actually Mexican-American, said that she appreciated Trump s  transparency.  She said: I just find that what you see is what you get with this man. And that is what I want. Another women, a church leader, said that she enjoyed that Trump was  a strong man with a strong personality.  Although, it s hard to believe that she s even been watching the election when she says: He really does love his country, loves people, he really has respect for women. The women also blamed Trump s rival, Senator Ted Cruz, for the nasty attacks that the candidates have made on each other s wives. Yes, these women excused this classy tweet from Trump:TwitterOne of the women   perhaps the only one with a little bit of common sense   admitted that she has  cringed on occasion when he s said a certain thing . She said: I wonder why (Trump has) said a certain thing, but that s his personality. He s just   he just lets it roll. According to one of the women, only Trump  going back on his policies and on the issues could stop her from supporting him   which is hilarious, considering that Trump is infamous for flip-flopping. Another woman said: It s his policies that we admire. And that s really the crux of it and has nothing to do with what he might call somebody or what kind of terminology he uses.

Although the legislature made promises to fix the budget, that fix never happened.In Maricopa County, where voter suppression issues were the most obvious on election night, the number of polling places was slashed from 400 in 2008, to 200 in 2012. But in 2016, Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell slashed that number again, leaving just 60 polling sites open for an area that has a population of more than four million people.But it wasn t just the lack of polling locations that contributed to the tremendously long lines. The locations that were open were inappropriately small, some with as few as six voting booths on site.Worse, as thousands of voters waited in line outside the polling locations, half the voting booths were purposely left empty by poll workers, who trickled voters in as slowly as possible.During the hearing, angry Maricopa County residents told stories of being forced to wait more than six hours to cast a ballot in the Presidential Preference Election. Some talked about how the incredibly long lines and lack of accommodations for people with disabilities made it impossible for them to cast a ballot at all.A poll worker testified that the system in her district attempted to force her to give Republican ballots to Democratic voters throughout the day. To her credit, she gave those voters paper ballots and recorded every person that was impacted by the supposed system failure.Secretary of State Michele Reagan testified about what she claims were multiple unintended failures which occurred on the Secretary of State s website.Those  mishaps  ranged from the system s failure to identify registered voters when the information was entered in lower-case letters, to the system  accidentally  showing 100 percent reporting, along with patently false election results, at least six hours before the last vote was cast.One of the most important things to come out of the hearing, however, was Secretary of State Reagan s acknowledgement that voter registration information was tampered with.When asked if there was any truth to the widespread allegations that the party affiliation of voters was changed ahead of the election, Reagan immediately responded by saying  Yes. She then told the election committee, This is something that I know happened, and I know it happened to people in this room. It is not hearsay. It happened to someone in my own office. Watch this video clip from her testimony below.On Monday, Anonymous released the preliminary results of their own investigation into Arizona election fraud.So far the group has confirmed 151 voters whose party affiliation was altered ahead of the Arizona primary. Of those, Anonymous has verified that 12 republicans, 139 Democrats and one voter of unidentified party affiliation were impacted.The group further confirms that of the 139 Democrats they have identified thus far, two were Hillary Clinton supporters, 113 were Bernie Sanders supporters and 24 were of unknown preference.Anonymous is trying to determine if the voter database was hacked.During the hearing, Geoff Woods of Phoenix Rising Media testified that his organization is aware of at least 4,000 people whose party affiliation was changed.Secretary of State Reagan stated that her office handled more than 2,000 calls on election day, while acknowledging that the lack of staffing at her agency likely resulted in many calls going unanswered.After the Arizona legislature made the decision to shut down the hearing, in spite of the fact that many more disenfranchised voters had waited for hours to have their turn to speak, the hearing ended in chaos.At least one person was arrested, as hundreds of citizens looked on in disbelief.  Is this America?  one man shouted.Fox 10 in Phoenix uploaded the entire hearing to YouTube in two parts.

Despite the existence of a mountain of evidence   including pictures of the bruises, numerous eyewitness accounts, and even newly-released video that clearly shows the attack, the Trump campaign has repeatedly continued its tradition of ignoring reality.After Lewandowski was charged, Trump assured the world that his campaign will continue to stand behind its campaign manager the same way that The Donald stands behind members of the  Make America Great Again  crowd who attack black people at his rallies. Following his campaign manager s legal issues, Trump jumped on Twitter to claim that the tapes   which, once again, clearly show the assault, demonstrate absolutely nothing: Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there! Yes, that s horrible, and grabbing a reporter so hard that it leaves bruises (no matter how disreputable she is) is pretty goddamn bad, but at least she didn t encounter former U.S. Attorney Kendall Coffey, an attorney representing Lewandowski. She might have spent a few weeks nursing bite marks.Coffee, who served with as much dignity as can be expected from someone associated with Trump from 1993-1996, resigned after he racked up a $900 bill at a Miami-Dade County strip club and allegedly settled the dispute by biting a dancer known only as  Tiffany  (and, ultimately, paying the tab with his credit card). The decision to leave is the most painful and difficult choice of my life,  Coffey told staffers as he resigned. But leave I must, because my family has already paid too great a price for the sacrifices that accompany public service. With the allegations recently raised and pending, I now have concerns about the possible impact on the important work of my office,  he said, apparently viewing dealing with the repercussions of biting a f*cking exotic dancer to be a run-of-the-mill  sacrifices  dealt with by public servants.The Sun-Sentinel reported at the time that Coffee s father bought back the credit card receipt for $1,200 in an effort to protect his son s actions from being discovered.The dancer and her husband at the time said that Coffee bit hard enough to  break the skin,  but that they did not want to end his political career.Men and women visit strip clubs on a regular basis, but not often does someone bite one of the dancers . That takes a special kind of animal   the sort that would accept work defending a man who attacked someone because he thought she was part of an adversarial media, the sort who would actually have done worse.Watch the pretty much indisputable security camera footage of the attack below:""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

If you want the long answer, watch John Oliver s definitive take on it here. Needless to say, introducing a profit motive to policing is a terrible idea, so a lot of people were understandably happy when the federal version of the program was suspended last year.But that s all done with now:The Justice Department today announced that it is resuming a controversial practice that allows local police departments to funnel a large portion of assets seized from citizens into their own coffers under federal law.The  equitable-sharing  program gives police the option of prosecuting asset forfeiture cases under federal instead of state law. The Justice Department had suspended payments under this program back in December, due to budget cuts included in last year s spending bill.This program allows the police to walk into your house with little to no justification, take your giant flatscreen TV and keep it to watch football games back at the station. Just to be clear, the police have admitted that they like to target people they KNOW will have nice stuff to take. They go after nice cars, expensive computers, etc. because they get to keep it and use it knowing there s almost no chance they ll ever have to give it back.Does that sound constitutional in any way, shape or form?Even worse, as the law enforcement community tumbles to the fact that they can rob the public blind, they ve gone on a spree that puts actual criminals to shame:Asset forfeiture is fast growing  in 2014, for instance, federal authorities seized over $5 billion in assets. That s more than the amount of money lost in every single burglary that year.And the police wonder WHY they ve lost the public s trust? Seriously?Now that the program has resumed, they re going to want to make up for lost time so expect to hear an increasing number of horror stories in the news. Also look for stories of the police using asset forfeiture as retaliation against all those pesky Black Lives Matter protesters that keep making them look bad by filming the police unnecessarily beating/killing unarmed black people.

And it went downhill from there.On Monday, a white supremacist hacker claimed responsibility for the mass hack:PRINCETON, N.J.   A well-known computer hacker who goes by the name of  Weev  said he was behind a wave of anti-Semitic, racist fliers that appeared on printers at more than a dozen college campuses last week. Weev is the alias of Andrew Auernheimer, who in 2010 was part of a group of hackers that discovered a security loophole on AT&T s servers and gained access to the data of 114,000 customers. Mr. Auernheimer was initially convicted of identity fraud and conspiracy to access a computer without authorization, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.It s not clear that  Weev  even broke any laws since all of the printers he accessed were open to remote printing and were not protected by a password.Although  Weev  did not mention Donald Trump, it s not much of a stretch to assume he s a big fan. While the white supremacy movement has always been lurking in the shadows, Trump s candidacy has emboldened it to crawl out into the light. With millions of people no longer ashamed to be openly racist, the ranks of the KKK and Neo-Nazi groups have swelled, giving them and people like  Weev  the confidence to publicly tout their hatred of Those People:The fliers directed readers to The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website. Mr. Auernheimer said free speech concerns were behind his printing spree.  My motivation is this: White cultures and only white cultures are subject to an invasion of foreigners. The  threat  to  white culture  that he s referring to is the loss of white privilege. This is truly a terrifying concept to people who think white people are inherently superior but refuse to compete on a level playing field. It s also the fear that minorities, once in power and no longer minorities, will treat white people the way white people have treated them for centuries.We should expect to see more (a lot more) racist propaganda being disseminated by bigots who honestly think their time has come again.Featured image via nbcphiladelphia.com""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

She believes she was targeted and intimidated because of her support for Bernie Sanders.Now she wants an apology.

For five hilarious minutes, Silverman cracks jokes in her signature style while making a truly convincing case for the Vermont senator. The comedian and actress stressed how much every vote in this particular election counted when she joked: If you vote or not, that s not my business, I m not your mommy. Though like your mommy, I have a completely full bush It s important that you treat your vote as something valuable, because it is. It s so valuable. Candidates literally spend billions of dollars trying to get your vote. Confessing that she was a fan of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton before Sanders began his presidential campaign, Silverman said: I m a feminist. Democratic woman president? Yes please! Silverman gives an amazing explanation of how nearly every politician s campaign works when she talks about the contributions from corporations and banks that Clinton has been known for. Silverman said that although she was aware that Clinton was taking those contribution, she thought it was just what candidates must do to win in the era of Citizens United. Every politician takes money from big money, ever since it was made legal through Citizens United. It s legalized corruption. If all the other ball players are taking steroids, you have to take steroids too to compete, right? Of course, this was all until Sanders, who Silverman describes as a  giant fuck you to the above-the-law billionaire class , came onto the scene. Once Bernie entered the race, Silverman said that she became a diehard supporter because he was the only candidate to refuse big money and run a different campaign. Silverman clarified, I m not against Hillary. I ve just met someone I have more in common with. Instead, Sanders ran a truly unconventional campaign that was built on the donations of millions of everyday Americans. Silverman explained: This man is running for president on a platform that is just a giant fuck-you to the above-the-law billionaire class who have been controlling government policy with their money, and not paying a nickel in taxes through government loopholes they secure with said money. Without taking a penny from Super PACs, corporations, or self-interest groups, Bernie Sanders raised over $100 million from over 5 million individual donations, donations from human people, averaging $27 each. He proved that what is right can also be possible. Silverman said that Sanders  refusal to follow suit and take big money donations like every other candidate has proven that Citizens United is not a necessary evil. It s just evil.  Also tackling the  socialist  title that has plagued Sanders  campaign, Silverman said: He s a Democrat. He just believes that people who don t have the same advantages as you and me should be given the same advantages as you and me. Silverman assured Americans that they can still fulfill their dreams of becoming rich assholes, it s just that your fellow hard-working citizens don t have to feed their children cat food in order for you to do it. In closing, Silverman begged non-voters to contribute to the election and go against the status quo by casting their vote. She said: Don t be sucked into a rigged American Dream ponzi scheme that was never intended to include you. Vote.

Having religious freedom is not the freedom to be discriminatory against others based upon your faith, it is the freedom to worship how you like on your own time. The First Amendment was very clear in its intent of separation church and state with the Establishment Clause. There is no national religion, there is no religious test, and having a faith is not required.However, there are those who still like to skew not only the Constitution to their liking, but also the Bible to their favor. Folks like Senator Ted Cruz who will pick and choose which laws suit their fancy and which Bible verses they want to hold near and dear to their hearts to throw in people s faces when they want to be bigoted jerks.When it comes to  religious liberty  in the state of Georgia, the state s legislature passed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse to serve or hire base upon sexual orientation. However, noticing that such a law is not only bigoted, but would also be harmful to the state economy as many businesses were threatening to leave, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal made the smart choice to veto the bill.Governor Deal had it exactly right when he said: I do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia. But Senator Ted Cruz used his skewed and biased point of view based upon his own understanding of things, and had this to say regarding the veto: I thought that was very disappointing to see Governor Deal in Georgia side with leftist activists and side against religious liberty. It wasn t too long ago that religious liberty enjoyed bipartisan support. The modern Democratic party has determined religious faith is inconsistent with its political objectives. I think that s shameful. The only people using their supposed faith and point of views for political objectives are people like Ted Cruz. Legalized discrimination doesn t become less discriminatory when you call it  religious liberty.  It s still unconstitutional and it s still wildly un-American.If Cruz wants to call those who follow the Constitution and abide by the 1st and 14th Amendment  leftist activists, well, then so be it.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""When Donald Trump stood at his podium at a rally and declared,  I have no friends You re my friends,  he apparently wasn t kidding. A scathing new report from The New York Times tells the sad story of a Donald Trump who at nearly 70-years-old has no real friends.One of Trump s favorite things to talk about are his celebrity friends. In the past he s been chummy with the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Regis Philbin, Howard Stern and he loves playing golf with athletes like Tom Brady, but the reality is, none of those people are what you and I would classify as friends. Richard LeFlak, a real estate tycoon who has known The Donald for four decades, told the Times that Trump is  very gregarious and has lots of acquaintances, but people he s close to? Not so many. LeFlak isn t alone in his analysis of Trump s personal life:  He doesn t really have a lot of friends,  said Billy Procida, a financier and business confidant of Trump s,  Pretty much all he does is work and play golf.  Reverend Al Sharpton, who knew Trump before he decided to become a Republican all of a sudden, said: Out of all the political and business and entertainment circles that we ve moved in together over the years, I never really met anyone who was Trump s good friend. In fact, I ve never even met anyone who claimed to be his good friend. It may seem harsh, but that s just how Trump operates. He s an introverted narcissist who spends his time with family, presumably because he doesn t have anything to prove. That analysis fits with a statement from Trump s longtime coworker and head of acquisitions, Abe Wallach, who told the Times that Trump would practically beg coworkers to hang out with him after work: Donald would call and say,  Abe, what are you doing? Marla and I are flying down to Atlantic City. You and David want to come?  Wallach said.  I always thought:  Why me? I work with him all week. Isn t there someone else? Apparently not. There is very little that suggests that Trump is capable of forming and maintaining personal relationships with people who aren t related to him. Wallach gave the Times the reason why: Deep down, he s a very nice guy,  Wallach said,  but he can t let go and just be nice because he fears that people will take advantage of him. Donald is actually the most insecure man I ve ever met. He has this constant need to fill a void inside. He used to do it with deals and sex. Now he does it with publicity. Ouch. Obviously, if a man who has known Trump most of his professional career and spent time with him and his family can spout off like that and trash The Donald s social skills so easily, there must be something to it. It could be that Wallach is right; that Trump lacks the confidence and self-respect to trust that not everyone is out to screw him, or it could be far simpler. He might just be an insufferable douchebag.Whatever the issue, what we have here is just another reason Donald Trump is unfit to hold the highest office in the land. Personal relationships are certainly important in trade, foreign policy and relations across the aisle.

This masterful piece of trolling started as a tongue-in-cheek statement about how  responsible gun owners  are allowed to place everyone at risk everywhere else, yet enjoy safety from armed maniacs whenever they congregate   but the right wing began to take it seriously, demanding that their rights not be infringed.On Monday, the killjoys in the Secret Service announced that attendees will not be permitted to carry their Confidence on their hips at the convention   no matter how badly quite literally everybody (even Donald Trump) wants it.Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback explained that  only authorized law enforcement personnel  working with the agency will be allowed to bring their weapons inside. Individuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint, regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event,  Hoback told The Hill, explaining that everyone else will have to leave the Second Amendment freedumbs at the door.This, of course, was a huge disappointment to people who really wanted to see how this sort of thing would play out, with some even suggesting crowdfunding an open bar just to help things along.     We must take a stand. We cannot allow the national nominating convention of the party of Lincoln and Reagan to be hijacked by weakness and political correctness,  the hilarious petition reads.  The policies of the Quicken Loans Arena do not supersede the rights given to us by our Creator in the U.S. Constitution. This is a direct affront to the Second Amendment and puts all attendees at risk,  the petitioner writes in his attempt to create chaos simply by allowing violent, gun-obsessed Republicans to be themselves.Despite the clearly satirical nature of the petition, Donald Trump stands behind it, though he wants to  read the fine print  before his supporters are allowed to carry guns   which is probably a good idea. The RNC, of course, jumped on the chance to evade any responsibility for the very, very bad idea it would be to allow right-wingers to carry guns into what will almost certainly be a volatile environment: The Republican Party has been and will continue to be a staunch supporter of the Second amendment,  said convention spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski.  It is in our platform and is strongly supported by our candidates.The Republican National Convention is a National Special Security Event which means the Secret Service is the lead agency and we will defer to their planning as it relates to safety and security of the convention. This may seem surprising to hear from us, but the Secret Service should reconsider. If the people want Republicans to be able to carry their guns at the convention, they should be allowed. After all, we have to deal with them in restaurants, grocery stores, schools, hospitals, and anywhere else guns should not be allowed. It would be nice for them to experience what they force the rest of us to deal with on a daily basis for once.If someone is hurt or killed, it s just the  price of freedom.

Citing unspecified and mostly nonexistent threats, the Second Amendment warriors say that ammosexuals should pack heat wherever they go   just in case a  bad guy with a gun  shows his dirty, rotten, face. Unfortunately, far too many people fall for the right-wing group s propaganda   and one such man is Marcus Donald, 31, of Memphis.Donald was arrested on Sunday after he attempted to enter Easter services at a Baptist church. Like many scared white men across the nation, Donald came to church locked and loaded. For years, the Baptist Church has been  pointing people to Christ with gun giveaways and calls for congregations to arm themselves. While Donald s decision to show up to church armed to the teeth would normally be celebrated, there was one problem   his skin color.Aside from the obvious exterior features   Donald is black   he seems like the typical NRA acolyte. But that didn t stop police from showing up to arrest him. The man came to church with  a loaded 40 caliber Beretta in the pocket of his pants and a 300 Blackout Assault Rifle in a backpack,  according to police. Upon his arrest, he told law enforcement that people in society are a threat to him and that he must be vigilant. If Donald had been white, he would have been permitted to walk straight into the church and endanger the 4,500 people present   but a security guard stopped and disarmed him before he had a chance to make it through the doors. We are thankful for the diligence of (our) security and the Memphis Police Department,  Jim Barnwell, Bellevue Baptist Church, Director of Communication Services, told Fox 13. This is a photo of Barnwell: What were the man s intentions? We don t know,  he said, a question that would likely have not been asked with regard to a white man.

Donald, like many people on the Right should be when they carry an assault rifle around town, to the grocery store, to church, or anywhere else where guns are not appropriate, was taken in for  emergency commitment  despite that Tennessee state law allows guns inside churches unless that property is being used for a school event or if signs are posted that weapons are banned  the only time a mentally ill person can be taken into custody solely for being mentally,  according to the Crisis Intervention Team at the University of Memphis.Barnwell says he is unaware if the church has a policy against guns, but his staff was very quick to call police when they saw a scary black man with a gun even though there was nothing aside from Donald s decision to carry loaded weapons around (once again, something crazy crackers do all the time) to indicate he is mentally ill.Police say he may not be cited for carrying the weapons around if he had a valid permit   but it is interesting that he was accosted by police at all. While this should be the standard reaction whenever anyone runs around with loaded firearms, it s not.

In Georgia, at least, Big Business reigns supreme. In a move that is sure to exacerbate the tensions within the Republican Party, Georgia s Republican governor Nathan Deal has vetoed a controversial  religious freedom  bill that was aimed at legalizing anti-LGBT discrimination:Deal s decision comes two weeks after the state legislature passed a bill aimed at shoring up the rights of religious organizations to refuse services that clash with their faith, particularly with regard to same-sex marriage.Immediately after passing that bill, Georgia came under fire from numerous large corporations like Disney, the NFL and others who threatened to boycott the state or move their business elsewhere. The top show on television, The Walking Dead, also threatened to leave the state if the bill was signed into law.Liberals are celebrating, but took the entirely wrong message from the veto: Today, Governor Deal heard the voices of Georgians, civil rights organizations, as well as the many leaders in the entertainment industry and private sector who condemned this attack on the fundamental rights of LGBT people, and he has set an example for other elected officials to follow,  Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement.While conservatives turned around and blamed liberals and politically correct something or another. I m assuming the death threats have already started flowing in to Deal s office.But Governor Deal is not a sudden proponent of LGBT rights. He s a Republican. That should give a hint that the only reason this happened is because Corporate America told him what to do. Since marriage equality and LGBT rights won the culture war, being seen as anti-LGBT hurts profits.That is, literally, the bottom line.While pounding their chest about  religious freedom  still helps Republican politicians in their benighted conservative states, being associated with the anti-LGBT movement hurts corporations. Even Chick-fil-A had to back down after acting on their anti-gay sentiments in the form of donations to anti-LGBT groups. Yes, there was a surge in business as bigoted conservatives rushed out to support the fast food company but once that died down, the boycott and bad PR remained.Being publicly anti-LGBT is bad business. Doing business in an anti-LGBT state is bad business, too. That s why corporations keep threatening to leave states that pass what are laws essentially legalizing discrimination and hate. In a state like Georgia, one of the few red states with a functioning economy, they can t risk the loss of business for a pointless ideological fight that s going to eventually be struck down by the soon-to-be liberal controlled Supreme Court.This is not a new victory for the LGBT community so much as a predictable and direct consequence of their already winning the war.

When did I decide that I could no longer support Trump? Last fall, when he did not have any idea of what the nuclear triad is in a debate. Actually, he didn t  decide  when he should stop supporting Trump   he was fired by Trump for a series of vile Facebook posts targeting President Obama, African Americans, and liberals with racist, violent rhetoric. In 2007, he called Civil Rights Leader Al Sharpton s daughter the N-word.He frequently referred to Obama as a  Socialist Marxist Islamo Fascist Nazi Appeaser  or a  Pan Arabist Marxist Muslim.  He is also   of course   a rabid birther. His comments were so noxious, that Trump was forced to part ways with him.And now he s Team Cruz and he has a completely different versions of events. Hilariously, he told POLITICO that it was Trump s failure to denounce (fellow) white supremacist David Duke as part of what led him to have a falling out with Trump. Apparently Nunberg believes in firing him, Trump got rid of the wrong racist in his campaign.Nunberg s effortless shift to Cruz only reinforces what many critics have been saying all along: The  vote Cruz to stop Trump  movement within the Republican Party, endorsed by moderates like Mitt Romney, isn t picking the  lesser  of two evils. Both candidates are shockingly bad options, and vile in their own ways. Voting for either means resigning the Republican Party to its worst elements: Racism, xenophobia, religious fanaticism and war-mongering.

After a winter that featured anatomical insults, violent clashes at rallies, and fierce accusations of lying and dirty tricks, Republicans say the past week has been particularly dispiriting.Under normal circumstances, I would be cringing right along with them. In decades past, any presidential candidate that acted with such reckless disregard for civility would be shamed out of the public square. Even Karl Rove, the scummiest political operative in Washington D.C., always did his smears from a distance by using proxies that could not be directly linked to the Republican candidate.Those days are long gone as the two frontrunners really are just one thrown chair and a paternity test away from turning the Republican primaries into a full-blown Jerry Springer episode:The luridness has weighed not only on Republican elected officials but on voters as well. In a recent CBS News-New York Times poll, 60 percent of Republican primary voters said the campaign has made them mostly embarrassed for the party rather than mostly proud. The survey was conducted before the Cruz-Trump fight involving their spouses erupted.I imagine that number is closer to 70% by now and instead of cringing along with Republican voters, I can only point my finger and laugh. A lot.By the way, that was 60% of REPUBLICAN primary voters, the most faithful of the faithful. How do you think Republican moderates view the whole thing? Independents? Democrats? Yeah, when Trump wins the nomination, he s going to be utterly crushed in the general election no matter WHO the Democratic nominee is. How can I NOT laugh?It s even funnier to point out,  You built that.  And they did. So very very much. They fully embraced the incoherent rage and hate of the Tea Party because it won them elections. It didn t matter that your average Tea Partier was completely detached from reality and common decency as long as they voted Republican, attacked Obama and did it loudly. The conservative movement let the fringe take over because it was easier than admitting that the Bush years were a total disaster of their own making.And so the Tea Party dragged the level of discourse into the mud and buried it. They set the bar so low that it s now allowed Donald Trump to run the kind of campaign that used to be unthinkable, filled with vulgarity, violence and idiocy that is an international embarrassment. Even worse, the Democratic primary has been a model of civility between the candidates (if not their followers). It s like watching a family with two well-behaved children and then looking down at your two screaming neurotypical brats throwing temper tantrums. You want to be mad at that other family but all you feel is a burning shame that you failed as a parent somehow.

The guy is like Teflon   his supporters are so brainwashed that they don t care how many lies he tells or how many people he insults. They just want Trump in the White House. Carson said to the hosts: I can tell you this. If there are shenanigans, if it s not straightforward, all of those millions of people that Donald Trump has brought into the arena are not going to stay there.And the Republicans are going to lose. And it s going to be not only the presidency, but it s going to be the Senate, and it could even be the House. It s going to be absolute destruction. The thing is, though, the GOP is done either way if Trump gets the nomination. The majority of Americans are not bottom feeding racists, misogynists, and homophobes like Trump supporters are. They are the lowest of the low, and everyone knows it.  Make America Great Again  is nothing more than code for  Make America White Again.  Most people, regardless of political persuasion, know how dangerous Donald Trump and his horrible rhetoric are. He and his supporters are reminiscent of the rise of Adolf Hitler, and we all know how that turned out.Carson went on to opine: And if they re more concerned about America, they will not blow up a straightforward process. They will let the will of the people prevail.

I first ran across Sortable while scrolling down my Facebook newsfeed. The business is paying for advertising on the social media network and their ad made me laugh out loud:Sortable says they want to offer people in the tech industry a safe place to live and work if Donald Trump is elected president. Now, while we don t think Americans will actually move en masse to Canada if the election doesn t go their way, we do want to extend an offer. Because it s the polite, Canadian thing to do Over the last year, Sortable s popularity has followed a similar trajectory to Trump s. We have been growing 40% month over month, and our ad engine is handling 3 billion ad impressions each month. While Donald Trump has been really bad for America, he is actually proving to be quite profitable for our Northern neighbor. Sortable isn t the first Canadian entity to offer their country up as an alternative option if Trump is elected. Recently an island in the country also announced they would welcome us with arms wide open if the billionaire somehow manages to bamboozle his way into the White House. Further, the anti-Trump sentiment across America has given the country a noticable bump in tourism.Sortable s founder Christopher Reid said he began the ad campaign after watching the progression of the United States  presidential election: It s bizarre and it s funny and we thought, why not use that as an opportunity to sort of promote the fact that we re hiring aggressively and we re looking globally. We re doing it because we need to find people and it s fun. What s perhaps even funnier than the campaign to lure American workers to the company, is their attempt to bring Canadians, who are working in Silicon Valley, back home:While it is funny to watch Canadian businesses and towns use Donald Trump s rise to power to advertise, it s also really embarrassing for America. We are quickly becoming a laughingstock around the world. It was bad enough when our allies were scratching their heads and wondering why we have so many mass shootings while they have virtually none, but now we have Bozo the Clown running for president. Trump s steady flow of hate, bigotry and bullshit is damaging our already bruised reputation further.These kinds of ad campaigns further highlight how important it is that Democrats get off of their sofas and vote in November.

Despite the rampant problems with Youth Services International, the state of Florida is merely accepting new applications from other for-profit prison companies. These private prisons interfere with the administration of justice. And they re driving inmate populations skyward by corrupting the political process,  wrote Senator Bernie Sanders in a Huffington Post article last year.  No one, in my view, should be allowed to profit from putting more people behind bars   whether they re inmates in jail or immigrants held in detention centers. In fact, I believe that private prisons shouldn t be allowed to exist at all, which is why I ve introduced legislation to eliminate them. Senator Sanders went on to explain how the for-profit prison system facilitates prisoner abuses, harms minorities, victimizes immigrants, influences prison policy and immigration policy while corrupting politicians to favor the interests of the for-profit prison industrial complex. The state of Florida has clearly seen the problems posed by placing the management and control of their prison system in the hands of a private company, yet they are continuing to place the livelihood of thousands of teenagers who need help in the hands of companies who just see them as profit. The Justice is not for Sale Act proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders would ban private prisons in America, but in the meantime, states, such as Florida need to start taking action on prison reform by not using the criminal justice system as a means for profit.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Chuck Grassley and challenge him to hold hearings on the nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated last month by the death of Antonin Scalia, according to a campaign official.Clinton has spoken out forcefully against the Republicans  intransigence to hold nominating hearings, accusing the GOP of implicit racism in ignoring President Barack Obama s nominee, and noting that it has never taken the Senate more than 125 days to vote on a Supreme Court nomination.Even controversial Supreme Court nominees offered up by Republican presidents, like Justices Alito and Roberts and nominee Robert Bork, were given hearings and subjected to a vote by the U.S. Senate.Republicans have offered several phony excuses for the opposition to Garland, including the strange claim that the Senate shouldn t act on nominees in the last year of a presidency. Historical precedent has already shown that that isn t true.Republican leaders with no actual role in Garland s nomination, like Speaker Paul Ryan, have also chimed in against an up or down vote.But polling shows that an overwhelming majority of Americans, including many Republicans, believe that Garland deserves a fair hearing. In response, some Republicans have already given in on sitting down and having a discussion with the nominee, particularly those in blue or purple states who face re-election this year against strong Democratic candidates.The rest of the Republicans opposed to a Garland hearing are already facing the prospect of having their obstruction linked to highly unpopular presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump has made the same arguments against a Garland hearing as his Republican allies, and some, like Senator John McCain (R-AZ) are facing advertising tying them in with Trump s position here, among others.Despite Arizona s history as a Republican state, the most recent polling has shown McCain tied with his Democratic challenger.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Experts are saying that Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is being deceptive when he responded to allegations that he had extramarital affairs with five women, allegations originally published by the gossip magazine National Enquirer. One of the women apparently is Donald Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, and the other is Carly Fiorina deputy campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores. So Ted seems to have been quite busy, although the idea is quite gross to think about.Phil Houston developed a model to detect deception when he was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency. He has conducted thousands of interrogations for the CIA and other federal agencies. Houston said: Behaviorally, when the facts are the ally of an individual, he or she almost always tends to focus on the facts of the matter at hand. In this case, if the key fact was that he had not had these affairs, Cruz would almost certainly have been much more strongly focused on the denial. That is, he very likely would have made a point of explicitly stating something along the lines of,  I did not have these affairs.  Yet at no point in either statement did Cruz say that. He implied it by saying the allegations are false, and that they re lies, but behaviorally, such statements are not equivalent to saying he never had the affairs. Even if we were to overlook that fact and consider his statements to be a denial, there is an overwhelmingly higher proportion of attack behavior compared to the effort expended at denial. This type of lopsided attack-to-denial ratio is very consistent with what we have historically seen with deceptive people when allegations are levied against them. Houston was referencing Cruz s two statements denying the allegations, the first of which he posted on his Facebook page: I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won t go. These smears are completely false, they re offensive to Heidi and me, they re offensive to our daughters, and they re offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack. Donald Trump s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow. He subsequently spoke about the scandal (you can watch the video below). Cruz said: The National Enquirer published a story. It is a story that quoted one source on the record: Roger Stone, Donald Trump s chief political advisor. Let me be clear, this National Enquirer story is garbage. It is complete and utter lies. It is a tabloid smear, and it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen. It is attacking my family, and what is striking is Donald s henchman, Roger Stone, had for months been foreshadowing that this attack was coming. It s not surprising that Donald Trump s tweet occurs the day before the attack comes out. And I would note that Mr. Stone is a man who has 50 years of dirty tricks behind him. He s a man for whom a term was coined for copulating with a rodent. Well let me be clear: Donald Trump may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him. And this garbage does not belong in politics. The National Enquirer has endorsed Donald Trump, has said he must be President. And so Donald, when he s losing, when he s scared, when Republicans are uniting against him, decides to peddle sleaze and slime. You know, Donald is fond of giving people nicknames. With this pattern, he should not be surprised to see people calling him,  Sleazy Donald. Based on these two statements, Houston concluded:   Given the lack of additional information upon which to conduct a more comprehensive behavioral analysis, this is nothing more than our initial opinion and assessment, and we will continue to follow this matter very closely. At the same time, we cannot help but conclude at this point that it s not looking good for Sen. Cruz. There are other factors as well: Cruz is a known liar. In fact, he has lied repeatedly during his run for the Republican nomination and has a reputation as a liar throughout his political career. At one point, it was his campaign that sent out mailers that confused voters into believing they had committed some type of violation because they hadn t voted in the previous election in order to scare them into voting for him.  It was also his campaign that purposely duped voters into believing that Ben Carson had dropped out of the race during the Iowa caucuses in order to steal Carson s  votes.In his defense, it can be argued that it s hard to believe that five women, yes five not one, would want to sleep with the likes of Ted Cruz, whose policies are not only draconian, but who isn t exactly a looker either.However, If this expert is correct, then Cruz, who touts himself as a conservative family values man, will go down as one of the biggest GOP hypocrites in history and that s saying a lot because there have been quite a few GOP hypocrites.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YSCzik5uPM]Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Theodore Herzl, an atheist Jew, who is considered the father of political Zionism, advocated for the expulsion of the Palestinian people when he helped launch the Zionist experiment. Over 100 years later, there are millions of displaced Palestinians and millions of others who are under a brutal Israeli military occupation, and the calls for ethnic cleansing continue not only by secular Israeli Jews but religious Israeli Jews.A novice on Israel would assume that these calls are by individuals on the fringes of Israeli society. However, the latest call comes from Israel s Chief Sephardi Rabbi, Yitzhak Yosef. Yosef said that non-Jews should be forbidden to live in the  Land of Israel. Also striking is Yosef s views on non-Jews in the country, deeming them as inferior, a view shared by the vast majority of Israeli Jews toward the Palestinians. In fact, at the very most, Yosef believes that the Palestinians should be servants to the Jews. He said: If our hands were strong, if we had governing power, then non-Jews shouldn t live in the Land of Israel. But our hands aren t strong. We re awaiting our righteous Messiah, who will be the true and complete redemption, and then they ll do this. The reason some non-Jews are allowed to live in Israel is to serve the Jewish population. Who will be the servers? Who will be our assistants? Therefore, we leave them here in the land. It must be emphasized again that this is not an individual who is on the fringes of Israeli society. He is the chief rabbi of millions of Israelis who feel the exact same way. Moreover, just like Theodore Herzl and the early Zionists who set the seed of racism and ethnic cleansing, a majority of Israelis want Palestinians expelled from the land. That is alarming, given that the  Israeli government has life and death power over the Palestinians and right wing crazy Israeli settlers walk around Palestinian neighborhoods brandishing their weapons and terrorizing Palestinians.Unfortunately, the United States is Israel s enabler and we give them billions of dollars in weapons every year. One only need look at the embarrassing way our politicians grovel to the influential pro-Israel lobby (AIPAC), which has a stranglehold over US politicians. Have you ever wondered why most politicians fawn over Israel? It is because AIPAC can make or break a candidate if it deems him/her to be nonconformist to anything Israel.Yet, Americans also have a strong social justice fabric and if Americans new the nastiness of Israel s treatment of the Palestinians, we would collectively call on the boycott, divestment and sanctioning of Israel until it conforms to international law.Featured image via video screen capture ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

So whenever Trump has opened his mouth to talk about international affairs, she is taken aback. He cannot stick to a subject. It is remarkable,  Mitchell told Chuck Todd.  And when he doesn t know something, he just changes the subject, and makes it all about himself. Todd had just referenced an interview where Trump changed the topic rather than answer a question about whether he would use a nuclear weapon against ISIS.Chuck Todd mentioned that national security talk is especially noticeable to people like Mitchell who have literally spent their careers keeping up with foreign policy. He would cancel defense treaties with Japan and South Korea against North Korea,  Mitchell said in reference to a Trump interview with the New York Times.  He would be okay if Japan and South Korea go nuclear. American policy for decades since World War II has been trying to keep nukes out of that arena. Then Mitchell explained how Trump would hurt America by cutting off our oil supply from Saudi Arabia if the Saudis refuse to pay the United States more money for defense, which would likely hit our economy like a ton of bricks as oil prices rise and the price of gas skyrockets. If we re going to make America less dependent on foreign oil, we have to do so gradually because all at once would be a disaster.But she was particularly concerned about the fact that Trump doesn t seem to understand that Iran isn t allowed to buy American planes, nor does he know that China is North Korea s biggest trading partner. He is completely all over the lot  Mitchell said.  On Iran, he complains that Iran isn t buying our planes. It had to be pointed out to him that Iran is still under sanctions and cannot buy American planes. He thinks North Korea and Iran are the biggest trading partners, when North Korea s biggest trading partner is China. And then she finished slaying Trump with a single line that should worry every American. He is completely uneducated about any part of the world. Todd went on to consult Katy Tur about what she has learned about Trump s lack of foreign policy chops, and she mentioned that Trump  doesn t understand the function  of US military bases around the world and  why they are there,  which would be a very important thing to know to be an effective commander-in-chief of our armed forces.Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump is an idiot when it comes to domestic policy and foreign policy, but considering the issues we face internationally whether it be terrorism, rising tensions in the Middle East, competing with China on the world economic stage, and dealing with a refugee crisis, the last thing America needs is a leader who doesn t know anything about any of these issues beyond campaign rhetoric that lasts a full sentence before the subject is changed.Presidents cannot just change the subject rather than deal with a foreign policy crisis. They have to figure out a solution to the problem and being uneducated about the situation to begin with doesn t exactly build confidence that the problem will be solved competently.And since Trump has proven that he can t do that, it doesn t make any sense whatsoever to elect him to the highest office in the land with a greatest responsibility in the world.Featured image: screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

No.Showing more than ever that he s a newcomer to the whole politicking world, Trump took to Twitter, yet again, to air his grievances about the political process.In yet another temper tantrum, Trump said: Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming.

However, Cruz may end up picking up some more, which is probably why Trump got his Underoos in a bunch. BUT this doesn t mean anything (at all) was done improperly. Per the Wall Street Journal: Mr. Cruz s supporters also seized five of Louisiana s six slots on the three powerful committees that will write the rules and platform at the Republican National Convention and mediate disputes over delegates  eligibility this summer in Cleveland.The little-noticed inside maneuvering that led to this outcome in Louisiana is another dramatic illustration of the inside game that could have an outsize influence on the bitter race for the GOP nomination. Sketchy? Yes. Illegal? No. Sure, it goes to show how devious politicking can get, but in regards to Trump, well, you can t change the rules once you start playing the game. Trump chose to enter the race as a Republican, and everything that is happening can and likely will be done to make sure Trump s not the nominee, much like with what s happening on the Democratic side. Hell, as much as Bernie Sanders wants to complain about Democratic superdelegates, his senior adviser Tad Devine helped put together the system. And again, you can t change the rules after you decide to play. Both Trump and Sanders are outsiders who willfully chose to play an insiders game. Either could have run as an independent, but both chose a party ticket for a better chance, and to their credit have done rather well.The Wall Street Journal also noted: While Mr. Trump leads in winning primary and caucus elections, and has won more delegates, the Cruz campaign is proving superior at the arcane game of picking the people who will be the actual delegates to the convention, where they will help write the rules and ultimately choose the nominee.That means that if Mr. Trump fails to reach the delegate threshold to claim the GOP nomination on the convention s first ballot, committees dominated by Cruz supporters could work to block him from winning enough delegates to claim the nomination on any subsequent ballots. Trump can threaten to sue all he wants, or even actually sue, but at the end of the day it just goes to show how much of a political novice he truly is. He needs to realize that while everyone else is playing Chess to skillfully maneuver their way to the nomination, he s still playing Candy Land.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Let s just start out by saying that the fact that the front-runner for the Republican nomination for President of the United States is actually being asked this question is beyond terrifying. The reality of a Trump presidency is very real, and we need to make sure we are listening to him very carefully. This includes, but is not limited to, reading between the lines of his very calculated language to dodge questions and pivot to more optically friendly topics that will put him in a more positive light amongst his rabid followers.Karl asked: So let me ask you, you said that Islam is at war with us. A lot of people wonder, given some of your proposals, whether or not you would go the next step towards internment camps. And I know you ve never proposed that. But let me just ask you here now, would you categorically rule out the idea of internment camps for American Muslims? This is when Trump pulled the classic non-answer of  no, but  which insinuates full-well, he s not ruling anything out, and he still puts the sole blame on all Muslims for not reporting things they don t see, assuming all Muslims are in the know of terrorist plots being made. Trump told Karl: rule it out but we would have to be very vigilant. We re going to have to be very smart. We re going to have to be very rigid and very vigilant. And if we re not very, very strong and very, very smart, we have a big, big problem coming up. We ve already had the problem. Check out the World Trade Center, OK, check out the Pentagon. We ve already had the problem. But I would   I would say you have to be extremely strong. You have to keep your eyes open.And by the way, Muslims in our country have to report bad acts, OK? When you look at what happened in Europe, in Brussels, where many, many people knew this thug from last week, was living right in the midst of them, right only a few doors down from where he was living previously, they knew he was there. Nobody reported him. When you hear someone say,  no, but  that s like hearing someone say,  I m not racist, but  and they go on to say something ridiculously racist. Trump is saying he d rule out internment camps in a very quick response to then fully pivot away to blaming all Muslims. Keep in mind, he s already insinuated in the past that he would have  had to be there  to decide if Japanese internment camps were a good idea or not during World War II. He keeps saying no, but then always leaves open the possibility. It doesn t take much to read between the lines. Unless, of course, you refuse to even look.You can t blame the entirety of everyone who follows a religion for the outrageous and horrific acts of a radical few who pervert the religion to suit their own morbid desires of sadistic control over a populace. You just can t. 1.6 billion people worldwide follow the religion of Islam. That s 23 percent of the global population Trump is blaming for the acts of the radical few. His simplistic and naive world view is not only extraordinarily narrow-minded and stupid, but extremely dangerous.We simply cannot allow Trump to become president.

In an apparent attempt to bring the GOP primary election to its rock bottom, Trump recently took to Twitter where he retweeted a photo that attacked Cruz s wife. The image showed two photos, one of Cruz s wife and one of Trump s wife. The image had a weird threat written on it, which said,  No need to spill the beans. The images are worth a thousand words. Miller defended the retweet earlier in the week during an earlier interview on CNN.He wanted to evade the question at all costs, so he decided to try and steer the conversation towards immigration.Tapper wasn t having it. He pressed the issue, and that s when Miller got a little erratic. Miller said: We get wrong what we re mad about in America! We don t get mad when Americans are murdered by illegal immigrants. We don t get mad when people have their jobs taken by cheaper foreign workers here on visa programs. We don t get mad when entire cities are crushed by our trade policies that send jobs overseas. Tapper wasn t going to let Miller off the hook that easy. He continued to press Miller, stating that he doesn t want to know why Miller was being so evasive. You want to get into an argument? Then we ll get into an argument!  Miller exclaimed.  He just accused me of standing up for sexism, and that is absolutely inappropriate! Miller continued, saying: I said in that interview that it is a trivial issue to be debating retweets when it is a fact you have Americans dying every single day as a result of immigration policies! Americans all over this country see their communities destroyed by uncontrolled migration. The irony of the interview is that Miller is using evasion tactics that Cruz is famous for. When pressed on social issues, Cruz often jumps to a completely different topic. This was best exemplified when reporters asked Cruz about his stance on LGBT issues, particularly his lack of support for gay marriage. Cruz, then inexplicably went into a rant about the dangers of the Islamic State.You can watch the segment below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaKL5HFa4ZAFeatured image from video screenshot ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

One Bundy fan club member left a message at the governor s office saying: You killed an unarmed rancher, so now one of you must die. The Seattle Times reports:The governor s office reported Friday that threats related to the standoff and Finicum shooting continue to come in against Brown.One email demanded the release of refuge occupiers jailed on federal charges. It also demanded indictments for the officers involved in Finicum s death. If that doesn t happen, the writer said,  I am going to begin returning fire. Last month, the FBI released video of the shooting that left Finicum dead, and you can clearly see that he was reaching for his weapon when police opened fire. In spite of video evidence that exonerated the officers and proved that the imbecile known as  Tarp Man  was a violent thug, right-wingers insist the shooting was not justified. And to make things right, they want to murder police officers and the governor. That s insane.In addition to the continued death threats, authorities discovered that people hell-bent on retaliation are  aggressively hunting  the names of the officers who were involved in the shooting. This further highlights how important it is to keep those names from the public according to Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norris.Although the governor has said the officers names will eventually be released, it s definitely better that they are kept quiet right now. The people who are making the threats are missing some screws. It doesn t matter how much evidence is put forth that proves their outrage is completely unfounded, they ve made up their minds. Their actions are proof of what constant anti-government rhetoric does to people. And there is one party to blame for that: Republicans.For years, Tea Party Republicans have been spewing hate to their voters and telling them the government wants to hurt them. They do this knowing that the sovereign citizen movement that the Bundy Militia belonged to is one of the biggest threats to law enforcement.

However, after the public was rightfully outraged that DeNiro was giving credibility to these anti-science viewpoints, he released the following statement, saying that the film would not be shown: My intent in screening this film was to provide an opportunity for conversation around an issue that is deeply personal to me and my family. But after reviewing it over the past few days with the Tribeca Film Festival team and others from the scientific community, we do not believe it contributes to or furthers the discussion I had hoped for. Of course, the people behind this piece of propaganda are screaming that its removal from the film festival is censorship. Their statement on the development says: To our dismay, we learned today about the Tribeca Film Festival s decision to reverse the official selection of Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe. It is our understanding that persons from an organization affiliated with the festival have made unspecified allegations against the film,  the statement continued.  We have just witnessed yet another example of the power of corporate interests censoring free speech, art, and truth. Tribeca s action will not succeed in denying the world access to the truth behind the film Vaxxed. The film is directed by none other than Andrew Wakefield, the doctor who started the whole anti-vaxx movement with a bogus study in 1998. His so-called research has been completely discredited, but the damage has been done. The anti-vaxx movement is stronger than ever, and is a major public health risk. This isn t about censorship; it s about protecting the lives and health of the public.I am very glad that Robert DeNiro did the right thing and pulled this ridiculous film from the film festival.

Businesses with fewer than 25 employees would have an extra year to comply, delaying their workers receiving a $15 hourly wage until 2023. Governor Jerry Brown and his Democratic allies compromised with labor unions on the raise after unions successfully got wage initiatives on the November ballot that would have increase the wage from $10 an hour to $15 an hour immediately rather than over a period of time.The new deal would give businesses and the government time to prepare for wage increases instead of having to deal with them all at once.But the bottom line is that California is about to join Oregon as the second blue state to step up to lead the nation on the minimum wage and treating workers well.Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed her state s minimum wage bill into law earlier this month, drawing praise from labor unions and President Obama, who called the effort one that  will boost the paychecks of hardworking Americans and help support millions of workers trying to make ends meet  and urged Congress to do the same.But Republicans refuse to do anything that will help American workers at a time when wealthy CEOs are raking in profits at record numbers while their hardworking employees struggle to survive on a daily basis. Many Republican-controlled state legislatures have even passed laws banning cities and counties from raising the local minimum wage on their own, which makes it incredibly clear that Republicans don t care about the the strife of workers and their families while Democrats are consistently proving that they are committed to helping Americans do more than just get by.

Because spying on and treating Muslims like criminals is going to somehow prevent them from radicalizing.Not so, says Bratton, who wrote in his op-ed in New York Daily News that what Cruz believes about Muslims is  fiction  and that the outcome he seeks is a  fairy tale. Recently, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz called for police to  patrol and secure Muslim communities before they become radicalized.  We already patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods, the same way we patrol and secure other neighborhoods,  Bratton wrote.We do not  patrol and secure  neighborhoods based on selective enforcement because of race or religion, nor will we use the police and an occupying force to intimidate a populace or a religion to appease the provocative chatter of politicians seeking to exploit fear.Nor will we accept the fiction of Sen. Cruz s narrative as presented. Cruz repeated the false reports surrounding the NYPD Demographics Unit and my decision to abolish it because it wasn t serving any useful purpose. He tried to depict the demise of the unit, as other ill-informed observers have done, as a knuckling under to the forces of political correctness rather than the sensible administrative decision that it was. The fact is that the former administration had allowed the unit to dwindle down to two investigators. Why? Because the work of the unit, which was to map the ethnic makeup of the city to better understand the domain of the New York metropolitan area, was finished. The two remaining detectives simply had little to do.Bratton then dropped the hammer on Cruz. It is clear from his comments that Sen. Cruz knows absolutely nothing about counterterrorism in New York City. We have in this city, without a doubt, the most effective and extensive counterterrorism capacity of any city in this country and virtually any city in the world. Bratton went on to literally list the taskforces that work hard to provide counterterrorism for New York City, including the Joint-Terrorism Task Force with the FBI, Critical Response Command, NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau, NYPD Intelligence Bureau, and the NYPD Domain Awareness System.In the end, Bratton explained that over 900 police officers under his command are Muslims who work hard to keep the city and their own families safe from terrorists every day and schooled Cruz on the Constitution before cautioning him to actually do some damn research before opening his mouth again.Sen. Cruz s references to the discontinuance of the Demographics Unit shows he has been hoodwinked by a 21st century fairy tale that refuses to die. He uses it in tandem with his suggestions that the police create a looming presence to intimidate Muslim neighborhoods with a show of force.In New York City, we protect all communities from crime and terrorism   yes, Muslim communities too   because like us, they are Americans who own businesses, work hard, pay taxes and dream of a better life for their children. Over 900 of them work in my police department as police officers, many of them in counterterrorism and intelligence. Many of them have served in the military and fought for their country. We police our city not by campaign slogans or inflammatory rhetoric, but by an old piece of parchment called the U.S. Constitution and another called the Bill of Rights.Ted Cruz and others seem to be willing to sideline these principles because what they stand for shifts with the tide of the campaign and the shrillness of the name-calling.

The email exchanged between Wall and Walker s aide sheds a light on what might have been going on in Walker s administration, which would impede the sharing of information.Details of the email, published by the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel here, indicate that these Walker officials would do just about anything to avoid transparency.Wall wrote: I know that you didn t want me sending this electronically or to the office because of the (open) records issue, so I elected instead to send it to your home in writing and would ask that you feel free to shred it once you ve looked it over. Nobody will know that I sent it and this is strictly between you and me.

But the latest attempt in Indiana to legislate how we mourn takes it to a whole new level:The law says that  a miscarried or aborted fetus must be interred or cremated by a facility having possession of the remains,  and requires  a person or facility having possession of a miscarried or aborted fetus to ensure that the miscarried fetus or aborted fetus is preserved until final disposition occurs. It doesn t matter how far along the pregnancy is. Normally when a pregnancy ends earlier than 20 weeks, the  products of conception  (fetal tissue and the placenta) are treated like any other medical waste. After 20 weeks, the fetus is considered a  stillbirth  and the parents typically have the option to cremate or bury it if they choose.So even if a woman has a miscarriage at 8 weeks of pregnancy at home, under this law she could be required to keep the blood and tissue, take it to a hospital, and have it buried or cremated by a funeral home.Several other states have also passed similar laws (care to guess what color they are on the electoral map?).But why do this?For the last several years, I ve asked pro- life  proponents who insist that fertilized eggs and zygotes and fetuses are fully realized people a very basic question: If this is the case, why is it that no culture on the planet hold funerals for miscarriages or abortions?No one has been able to offer a coherent answer and for good reason: No one has a funeral for a miscarriage because miscarriages are not people.So Republicans are trying to redefine how we view miscarriages. They want us to consider them the moral and legal equivalent of the death of a child. Even if the  child  in this case is an 8-week-old microscopic collection of cells.Let that sink in for a moment: Republicans, the party of  small government,  are literally telling you how to grieve. I can t imagine a more intrusive abuse of government short of prima nocta.Sort of. 2006 was a rough year and my wife and I suffered two miscarriages. We buried the sonograms of two lost pregnancies, planted a tree and set up a plaque:You d think that I would be proof that miscarriages are people worthy of mourning. But you d be very wrong. We were not mourning a lost child, we were mourning the lost possibilities. I have three children now and I can tell you without reservation that I would rather face 1000 miscarriages than lose one of them. There simply is no comparison.Anyone that claims they would be just as hurt by the loss of a fetus as they would a child they held in their arms is, at best, a liar and at worst, a monster that thinks very little of their children.That Republicans would try to further traumatize women by legislating their grief is a reflection of how cruel and debased the party has become.Featured image via simplyoloni.com""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He was arrested more than once in Oregon. The charges included things like criminal mischief, obstructing an officer and disorderly conduct, charges often used by police to criminalize homelessness.If you can t sit or stand on the sidewalk, if you can t sleep on a park bench or in some other public space, where can you go?Maybe you d try to climb a tree, hoping that it would allow you some space to just exist.Of course that s not how it played out in Miller s case. Climbing that tree just brought him all kinds of negative attention.Some, including the police, turned this sad situation into a series of bad jokes.Not everyone missed the seriousness of the situation, though.Many Twitter users posted about the need to improve services for people with mental health issues, as well as for those who are homeless.As KOMO reports, at least one person in the crowd was deeply concerned about the situation.Janice Wilson, who was in town from Crescent City, California, to help her son deal with his mental health and legal troubles, said she was once homeless herself, 30 years ago.She repeatedly shouted up to the man:  We love you! Come down safely! I heard people out here laughing,  she said.  If somebody s in crisis to the point of putting himself at risk of suicide, what s to laugh about? As of November 2015, there were more than 565,000 homeless people in the United States.The city of Seattle is just one of many American cities that declared a state of emergency in 2015, due to the number of homeless people who reside there.While the number of homeless people in Seattle is on the decline, thanks to an increase in wages in the city, for people with physical and mental disabilities, getting a job and  pulling yourself up by your bootstraps  isn t always the answer.With proper treatment the majority of people who experience mental illness do lead normal, productive lives once the condition is treated. But a lack of funding for mental health services all across the country leaves too many people without access to that treatment.According to New York Daily News, Miller refused to leave his jail cell to attend a hearing today.Instead of getting the mental health treatment he obviously needs, it s looking like he will be criminally charged and incarcerated, along with thousands of other mentally ill people in the United States.Featured image via video screen capture KOMO  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

San Francisco Superior Court Judge Curtis Karnow determined that Corinthian Colleges is guilty of misleading students with false advertising. ProPublica published an excellent report on how Corinthian Colleges used predatory tactics to target homeless people and other marginalized communities for recruitment. Once students enrolled at one of the 91 campuses that made up Corinthian Colleges, they almost always ended up incurring a huge amount of debt that they could never pay back.Given that Corinthian Colleges filed for bankruptcy in May with only $19.2 million dollars in assets, it seems highly unlikely that students defrauded by the for-profit college will ever see a payout from the lawsuit.However, students who were defrauded by Corinthian Colleges will get some type of relief. The Department of Education announced on Friday that students will be given a way to have any debt they incurred while attending a Corinthian college forgiven. When Americans invest their time, money and effort to gain new skills, they have a right to expect they ll get an education that leads to a better life for them and their families. Corinthian was more worried about profits than about students  lives,  U.S. Education Secretary John B. King Jr. said in a statement.Despite the fact that students will not receive any money from the lawsuit, that does not mean that this isn t very good news. MarketWatch reports:The judgment could help students in another way, said Ben Miller, the senior director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. It could serve as evidence of Corinthian s wrongdoings for former students who are applying to the federal government to have their loans forgiven because they believe the school violated state law, he said.  It would seem like if there are programs within California that didn t have sufficient evidence for borrower discharge yet, I would think this judgment gives what s necessary,  he said.Overall this is really good news   though it does not really feel like justice truly has been served. No one should have to be given a debt sentence simply for wanting to receive a higher education. Criminal enterprises such as Corinthian Colleges would not have a market to exploit for profit if we had a tuition-free higher education system in the United States.

The Florida Times-Union reported:The bill, which passed largely along party lines, restricts state agencies, local governments and Medicaid managed-care plans from contracting with organizations that own, operate or are affiliated with clinics that perform elective abortions. Duval County is one of the health departments with a Planned Parenthood contract that may be affected by that provision.Basically, in his quest to destroy Planned Parenthood, he is hurting any woman who goes to these clinics for free pregnancy tests, cancer screenings, free birth control, STI screenings and a plethora of other services they provide. The laws requirements that doctors who perform abortion service have patient-transfer agreements with local hospitals or admitting privileges at a hospital in the area. It mirrors an Alabama law that was struck down on Friday by Federal District Court Judge Myron H. Thompson who said the law  unconstitutionally restricts the rights of women. Planned Parenthood s president, Cecile Richards, expressed outrage over the bill: As a result of this bill, thousands of people across Florida may no longer be able to access essential reproductive health care, such as cancer screenings, birth control, and well-woman exams. This cruel bill is designed to rip health care away from those most at risk. Rick Scott is just the most recent in a very long line of Republicans who are attacking women around the country. They pretend that they are  pro-life  and that they care about women, but none of this is true. The GOP isn t  pro-life,  they are pro-fetus, anti-women asshats who don t care about the sanctity of life any more than we care about they care about the thousands of veterans living on the streets. If they were actually pro-life they would wholeheartedly support social safety nets, birth control and oppose the death penalty.

During the interview, Trump claimed that one of the biggest challenges in the fight against terrorism is that  good  Muslims are withholding information about terrorist plots. It s like they re protecting each other,  Trump said during the interview.  They have to report the bad ones. And if you report the bad ones, then all of a sudden you re not going to have the problems. Here s the interview:This statement does not hold up to empirical evidence. Muslims do in fact quit often turn in radical extremists. Vox reports: In 2014, University of North Carolina sociologist Charles Kurzman identified 188 cases since 9/11 where the police had publicly identified a Muslim American as a suspected terrorist and disclosed where the initial tip came from. Of those 188, 54 individuals were brought to the government s attention via tips from members of the Muslim-American community. Muslim Americans were the single largest source of tips identified in Kurzman s study. To further illustrate the stupidity of Trump s claims, let s look at some other facts. Trump is implying that it is the Muslim population s responsibility to report  problems  to the authorities. By doing so he is placing responsibility for the actions of terrorists on Muslim communities  shoulders.There are approximately 1.6 billion Muslims in the world. That s about 23% of the world s entire population. Only about 3.3 million Muslims lives in the United States. During this interview, and for the entirety of his campaign, Trump has been using nearly a quarter of the world s population as a political scapegoat. The reality is that the Islamic State and other terror groups are followers of Salafi Jihadism. They are a relatively tiny cult of extremists, that mainly live in concentrated geographic regions.The chance that a Muslim person would actually know a Jihadist is pretty slim. The odds that they might stumble upon information about a possible terror plot is even slimmer. When we take that into account, and we look at the number of tips that come from Muslims about possible terror attacks since 9/11 it becomes quite clear that Muslims do almost always turn in information regarding possible terrorist activities when they come across it   and they know what they have come across.It s almost as if Muslims almost always do the reasonable thing that anyone would do if they were in that situation.Of course, none of this will probably matter to Trump or his followers. If he says he saw a video of Muslims cheering in New Jersey after 9/11, that s what they saw too. Featured image from video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This wasn t just an instance of someone who has been brainwashed spouting off about lynching ( hanging for Treason ) the President.

The usurper is here and if I get a chance I ll take him out and I ll take the shot,  Dutcher told a security guard at a La Crosse library as he prepared his attack against the President   something conservative media had convinced Dutcher was his Constitutional duty. Sure, he may have just been making small talk   Nice weather today. I m going to kill the President.   but Dutcher s Facebook posts leading up to the vocalization of his plot reveal that this is something he had been openly planning. I have been praying on going to D.C. for 3 months and now the upsurper is coming HERE. saving me a 800 mile trip,  wrote in a June 30 Facebook post.  Doing what I do for my daughter, so she can live free. pray for me to succeed in my mission.  Dutcher explained to his friends and family that it is his  CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO TAKE ACTION  because  the gov has declaired war on us. Another post, which Dutcher had deleted explained his plan in more detail: that s it! Thursday I will be in La Crosse. Hopefully I will get a clear shot at the pretend president. Killing him is our CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY! Numerous other posts complained that Secret Service was stopping people like him from taking the shot. Dutcher even told a detective in no uncertain terms that his threat was serious and   he would not have said what he said if he didn t intend to carry it out.  In fact, he told Secret Service his intent was to  circumvent security and figure out how to shoot (Obama) with a slingshot.  Dutcher, referencing the Biblical story of David and Goliath, told law enforcement that he could easily kill a human Bart Simpson style.Each of the many times he threatened the President could have landed him in prison for up to five years and cost him $250,000. Despite the very real nature of his promise to murder President Obama, the would-be assassin was only sentenced to three years in prison and three years of supervised release.This is exactly why conservatives feel it is acceptable to threaten the President. No matter how clear their intentions, no matter how many times they explain the ways they will  exucute  (to use Dutcher s word) Barack Obama, they receive the equivalent of a slap on the wrist.Dutcher will likely be seen as a martyr to the Revolution by our frenemies on the Right, but the truth is that he is a symptom of a cancer in society that we must cut out before it is too late.Featured image via Addicting Info archives""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

There is one other demographic that is  backing Bernie Sanders for president: the American men and women who serve in the military.Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who voted against the Iraq war, correctly predicting its terrible ramifications. Millions of Iraqis have been killed, a once thriving economy decimated, and a power vacuum was created that lead to the rise of organizations like ISIS.As for the United States, trillions of dollars have been lost which lead to a recession under the Bush administration unseen since the Great Depression.

The number of US servicemen and women committing suicide is alarming, estimated to be 50% higher than the general population.

But as it turns out, Wakefield s study was bogus and has been thoroughly debunked by scientists and medical professionals who then booted Wakefield out of the medical field for professional misconduct.Celebrities such as Jim Carrey, Jenny McCarthy, and Kristin Cavallari have jumped to Wakefield s defense in recent years, which has caused thousands of the fans among others to hold back from vaccinating their children. And as the anti-science movement continues to grow, the public health becomes more and more at risk.Just last year, a measles epidemic hit the United States for the first time since the disease had been largely eradicated from our shores in 2000, causing the first death of an American by measles in 12 years.Even Fox News  own medical expert roundly condemned the anti-vaxxer movement. Let me be clear on this, I see no debate whatsoever,  NYU Langone Medical Center associate professor of medicine Marc Siegel said. This is the greatest vaccine that has ever been created in the history of vaccines. You know we stamped out measles in the United States in 2000. It was incredible because measles is the most contagious virus known to man. If you had measles there would be a 90 percent chance that I would get it by sitting next to you if I weren t vaccinated. It s so much more contagious than the flu. We were talking about Ebola, this is a million times more contagious than Ebola! But Robert DeNiro wants to have that debate anyway even though it will just give credibility to a moronic movement that deserves none whatsoever. And the backlash has been so great that DeNiro released a statement on Facebook defending the screening. Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined. In the 15 years since the Tribeca Film Festival was founded, I have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the programming. However this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening VAXXED. I am not personally endorsing the film, nor am I anti-vaccination; I am only providing the opportunity for a conversation around the issue. No, Mr. DeNiro. All you are doing is giving an open platform to anti-vaxxers to spread their misinformation and scare more parents into not getting their kids vaccinated. You are perpetuating their lies and anti-science views and you should be ashamed of yourself for it. America is already witnessing the return of viruses such as whooping cough, measles, rubella, and many others because a growing number of parents ridiculously believe their kids will get autism if they get them vaccinated even though there is zero scientific evidence linking autism to vaccines.Wakefield s goal with this propaganda film is to assert that the government and scientific community are  covering up  the link and that vaccines have caused an autism  catastrophe  in this nation because of it. There is no true debate in this film and there won t be a real conversation after it is screened. It ll just be one big echo chamber designed to indoctrinate more believers into the anti-vaxxer movement, which DeNiro looks to be apart of despite his claims otherwise.

If I were an openly racist scumbag, I would also be thrilled that so many closeted scumbag racists are coming out into the open. People like Taylor and Edwards have always insisted that they represent a  silent majority  of whites. Why, if there was only some way to bring them all out into the open, we could finally have the Second Civil/Race War that would forever establish American white supremacy!In case you re unfamiliar with the white supremacy movement and think I m exaggerating, you must not know about The Turner Diaries, a wildly popular book among racists. Here s part of the Wikipedia summary:The novel ends with an epilogue from the year 2099, summarizing how the Organization continued on to conquer the rest of the world and how all non-White races were eliminated. Africa was invaded and all of its black inhabitants were killed. The Puerto Ricans (described as a  repulsive mongrel race ) were exterminated and the island of Puerto Rico was re-colonized by whites. When China begins an attempt to invade European Russia, the Organization launches a full-scale assault with nuclear, chemical, radiological and biological weapons which render the entire continent of Asia uninhabitable and rife with  mutants . And in America, the last remaining non-white elements are hunted down as well as all individuals involved in organized crime (such as the mafia).So, yeah, these are heady times for racists. Trump has made it OK for them to be out in the open and at political rallies. White power is on the rise!But here s the problem: It isn t. At all.America is a deeply racist county but racism flies in the face of everything we say we believe in: Equality, Fairness, Justice, etc. That means we like our racism to be out of sight, out of mind. In the 1960s, when White America saw hundreds of peaceful black protesters being savagely attacked by the police, they pushed back and the Civil Rights Act was passed. Lesson learned. Keep it on the downlow. Give white people the ability to deny that racism is a problem and they ll happily ignore it. Shove it in their faces and they get really mad. Next thing you know, blacks have more rights and more justice.How dreadful!With the rise of Trump and his white nationalist army of violent thugs, the public is being exposed, once again, to widespread racism. Specifically widespread conservative racism (yes, liberal racism exists but we re not fucking proud of it like conservatives are). The more preening idiots like Taylor and Edwards parade their hate in public at Republican rallies, the less plausible deniability the GOP has. Not for nothing, you don t see neo-Nazis and the KKK coming out to support a Democratic candidate. Ever.The corporate media has bent over backwards to under-report this fact but it s getting harder to hide. Trump is drawing out the worst elements of America s conservative movement for everyone to see. More importantly, that element will refuse to go back into the closet after Trump loses and fades from view. Republicans will be forced to loudly denounce the very racists they used to rely on or be permanently labeled as the party of white supremacy, an electoral kiss of death. Republicans will lose their racist base and the racists will lose their political party.So even as Taylor and Edwards giggle at their  rising  power, they re guaranteeing themselves a future as a marginalized voice in America politics and they re going to cripple the conservative movement in the process.Keep laughing, dumbasses.

The mailer comes in an envelope with a giant red  NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY  on the front. Inside, the chairman of the RNC himself notifies the addressee that they have  funds  past due and if they know what s good for them they ll pay.It s a tactic that may be legal; that doesn t make it any less despicable. For Reince Priebus to allow his name to be printed on the bottom of this trash right along with hiss signature proves that the GOP cares only about the money.

Like many of Trump s predictions and investments over time, that marriage also ended up going bust. He and Ivana divorced in 1991 after she found out he had been having an affair with Marla Maples, a former beauty queen.Trump then married Maples in 1993, and that marriage lasted until a breakup in 1997 and a divorce in 1999. He married his current wife, former model Melania Knauss, in 2005.The comment hints at other sexist remarks and claims that Trump has made over the years.

The reason is women, who give Clinton a whopping 20 point advantage over Trump   55 to 35 percent.Even when it has won presidential elections, Republicans have performed poorly with female voters.

That s not some of the states but ALL of them: The difference is quite striking,  said study co-author Colleen Barry, a health policy researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.  She notes that the trend became visible in every state a year after the pot was legalized.The study suggests that because patients that are experiencing chronic pain can substitute or suppliment marijuana for their pain pills, they are able to take smaller (or no) doses of the pills and are less likely to experience an overdose.This is even more significant than it seems (and it seems pretty significant). Since the Great Recession destroyed thousands of white communities all over the country, there has been a surge in drug abuse by white people. In fact, the death rate among white males has jumped dramatically, while it s decreased in every other demographic. Much of this has been from addiction to pain killers and, later, heroin.The reasons for this are not hard to understand: When confronted with the same kind of crushing poverty and despair that has afflicted black communities for generations, white people turned to drugs the same exact way. This, of course, means that we ll be forced to crack down on white drug users and send them to prison for decades.Just kidding!No, we won t be locking up millions of white people. This is America, silly! When white people are in trouble, we have to help them, not lock them up!What this means is that legalizing marijuana can and mostly likely will be seen as a partial solution to the opioid epidemic devastating white communities. Big Pharma won t like this because fully legalized marijuana will annihilate their pain killer profits. Normally, Big Pharma s profits are more important than human lives but when it s only WHITE lives on the line, you can be sure that something is going to be done about it.

In the ceremonial re-enactment of the foot-washing ritual Jesus performed on his disciples before he was crucified, the Pope again broke from the tradition of simply washing the feet of twelve Catholic men.In 2013, Francis washed the feet of women and Muslims at a juvenile detention center   a violation of longstanding rules he changed in January to allow all  people of God  to participate in the ritual. This shift from the patriarichal norm was not well-received by the American Right, but this year the Pope did something that sent conservatives into an irrational rage. To the Pope, who recognizes that Christians, Jews, and Muslims all worship the same God, this means anyone could be chosen to participate in the ritual.This year, four women and eight men participated. The women included an Italian Catholic and three Eritrean Coptic Christian migrants. The men included four Catholics from Nigeria and three Muslims from Mali, Syria, and Pakistan, and a Hindu man from India. If this broad mix wasn t enough to cause the Right to seethe with hatred, the Pope s words helped ensure it would happen:That s the sort of claim that has been known to get a Muslim woman removed from teaching at a Christian university, right there. It s a completely sensible statement.  Allah  is simply the Arabic translation of the word  God.  Unfortunately, combined with the fact that Francis performed an expression of humility with regard to Muslims caused the Right to flip the f*ck out. Conservatives flocked to the Washington Post s Facebook page to unleash their anger, frustration, and stupidity:           There are manufacturers, arms dealers who want blood, not peace; they want the war, not fraternity,  the Pope said after condemning the Brussels attack in statements prior to the ceremony. You, we, all of us together, of different religions, different cultures, but children of the same Father, brothers   and there, those poor people, who buy weapons to wreck fraternity. Today, at this time, when I do the same act of Jesus washing the feet of twelve of you, let us all make a gesture of brotherhood, and let us all say:  We are different, we are different, we have different cultures and religions, but we are brothers and we want to live in peace,'  he added   a message of unity that has been warmly embraced by all who do not believe that hatred is the way to go about living, but has managed to somehow irritate conservatives.Watch this deeply humble action, below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Fortunately for Sarah Patterson, the mother of a 4 year old student at Tift County Pre-K Center in Tifton, Georgia, the school has cameras and someone willing to speak up:According to Sarah Patterson, the mother of the boy, her son just turned 4 years old on Wednesday, days after Stripling casually walked around an open classroom door and shoved her knee in the boys back without warning, causing him to lurch forward and to the ground.Stripling then helped the boy up with the help of another adult before giving him a shove into the classroom.It s easy to see that Stripling was trying to get him to move into the classroom. But it s also clear that she was completely unconcerned about how rough she was and only mildly concerned that her student might have hit his head on the ground.

Never mind the fact that there s a concerted effort underway to gut public education, stripping resources and talent and giving them to  charter schools  that waste billions with worse results; an even greater emergency is the rapid rise of autistic students and the complete failure of our school systems to prepare for them.My family is lucky. We lived first in New York City, which takes early intervention for special needs children VERY seriously (the earlier they get help, the better off they ll be). Then we moved to Northern Virginia (the very liberal part that turned the state purple) and they also take special needs education very seriously. Compare that to Southern Virginia (the inbred redneck to our hippie liberal) where they refuse to officially diagnose my clearly autistic nephew and told his mother that they can t be bothered helping him learn to tie his shoelaces so she should just get him Velcro sneakers.There s going to be a lot more of Southern Virginia than Northern Virginia in this country as millions of kids with special needs move through an educational system that doesn t know how to help them. They can barely handle what they already have and all too often resort to the kind of abuse that Stripling does. Sure, parents with money will be able to afford the expensive services their kids will need but even middle class families will unable to cope. And the working poor? Tough luck!

Recreating children s fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel, the NRA has taken it upon itself to rewrite the stories and give their heroes guns to defeat their enemies. After all, hasn t everyone wondered at some point or another what would have happened to Little Red Riding Hood if only her grandmother had been armed with a shotgun? Finally, this burning question has been answered.Little Red Riding Hood   NRA FamilyIn the recreated version of Little Red Riding Hood (Has a Gun), the Big Bad Wolf finds himself out of luck because Little Red has a rifle. He gives up and tries to eat Grandma instead, but finds himself in the same predicament because she s also packing heat. Here s a snippet of what the fairy tale looks like with the NRA s special trigger-happy touch: What big teeth you have!  Grandma said, as his fierce jaws came near. The better to eat you with!  the wolf threatened.The wolf leaned in, jaws open wide, then stopped suddenly. Those big ears heard the unmistakable sound of a shotgun s safety being clicked off. Those big eyes looked down and saw that grandma had a scattergun aimed right at him. He realized that Grandmother hadn t been backing away from him; she had been moving towards her shotgun to protect herself and her home.Hansel And Gretal   NRA FamilyThe story of Hansel and Gretel (Have Guns) isn t much better. In this adapted classic, Hansel and Gretal avoid danger because their parents taught them how to use guns. Gretel is not only able to hunt down a 10-point buck, but the pair is able to rescue the children being held captive in the witch s cottage   all because they re armed.These revamped children s tales certainly send the wrong message to kids, and hopefully parents will be smart enough to know that. Time and time again, we see that when guns get into the hands of children   even when they have been taught how to use firearms  things usually go terribly wrong.But the NRA has consistently proven that it doesn t know what s right for children   and the organization just doesn t care. The gun-friendly organization continues to promote its Eddie Eagle GunSafe  program, an initiative to help educate kids and prevent accidental gun deaths. It has been proven extremely ineffective several times, but the NRA refuses to actually do something that will really protect children   like support gun control. The association has consistently opposed and resisted any attempt the Obama administration has tried to make toward gun reform, even as mass shootings have become more common than ever.This is an organization that does not care about America s youth, and these rewritten stories prove it. These revised tales will only make kids want to use guns MORE, and offer zero education about the dangers and seriousness of handling firearms.Featured image via NRAfamily.org""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In reality, Trump s wealth comes from his father. Warren says that the only way that Trump has been able to retain his inheritance is by  cheating people  and  defrauding people.  Warren goes on to say: Donald Trump claims that the reason he s qualified to be president of the United States is that he is a very, very, very successful businessman. Donald Trump is not a great business success and it s time he s called on it. This isn t the first time Warren has called out Trump for his bad business decisions. Warren, a former Harvard Law professor, who specializes in bankruptcy law, wrote about Trump s nefarious failed business schemes. She also urged people to  listen to the experts who ve concluded he s so bad at business that he might have more money today if he d put his entire inheritance into an index fund and just left it alone. Warren also went on to note Trump s Mussolini quote gaffe.Warren also spent some time praising Bernie Sanders and the influence he has had on the Democratic Party and the nation. He s out there. He fights with the heart. This is who Bernie is. He has put the right issues on the table both for the Democratic Party and for the country in general so I m still cheering Bernie on. However, Warren does say that Clinton or Sanders would be far better leaders than what the GOP is offering. While the Democrats are saying,  Gee is the right answer to improve the Affordable Care Act in the following six ways or go all the way to single payer    which is a good debate to have   the Republicans are saying they are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something they can t quite describe. Warren has not disclosed who she voted for in the primary election. However, she did make progressive politicos sitting on the edge of her seat, saying that she will make an endorsement. That being said, she didn t say is she plans on making an endorsement before the primary election is over. Should she do so, I guarantee it will be done at a key strategic moment in the race. Possibly before the Washington caucus or the New York primary. Though, a pre-nomination endorsement seems unlikely.You can read the AP interview with Warren here.Featured image from Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This  Mom of the Year  candidate decided that it was not only appropriate to leave her children alone in the car while she went shopping at the Village Market in Birmingham, Alabama, but didn t think to remove her firearms from the vehicle   a  mistake  far too many gun enthusiast parents make.According to Birmingham police spokesman Sgt. Bryan Shelton, the children did what all children do when left unsupervised   they found something to keep themselves occupied. The older of the unnamed woman s children found her mother s gun, picked it up, and the firearm discharged. The bullet grazed the woman s four-year-old son s head, but did not enter the skull. Fortunately, the child was transported to a nearby children s hospital where he is in stable condition. If you choose to own a gun you have to be safety minded and exercise a higher standard of care,  Shelton said.  We re glad he s OK. While this was obviously a horrific and preventable incident caused solely by the arrogance and stupidity of one of the NRA s Chosen, commenters on the story at AL.com spoke up in her defense. After all, it s not as bad as abortion, right? Earlier this month, Florida Second Amendment advocate Jamie Gilt   who previously ran a pro-gun Facebook page   was shot in the back after her four-year-old son found her loaded handgun near his car seat.  Before the shooting, Gilt bragged that her 4-year-old gets  jacked up  to shoot guns with her, something she learned when she allowed him to have access to a gun through sheer negligence.Unlike the Alabama woman, Gilt ran afoul of a state law that makes it a crime   only a misdemeanor, but still a crime   to store a loaded firearm in such a manner that it is likely a child will gain access to the weapon. She faces up to 120 days in prison   far too little time, but still more than we usually see after this sort of incident.Until these  responsible gun owners start spending real time in prison, this sort of thing will continue to be commonplace, and the NRA will continue to convince its followers this was a horrible  accident  that could happen to anyone, never mentioning that  anyone  only includes people who view themselves as  good guys with guns.

The women had ordered some drinks already and were waiting to sing  Waterfalls  by TLC when the bartenders began treating them like they were the only two black people in a bar full of racists.As it turned out, they were the only two black women in a bar full of racists. According to the women, a bartender told them they couldn t sing karaoke unless they ordered drinks, which they had already done. Another rather large bartender got right in their faces and screamed  buy drinks  at them. Ultimately the women were asked to leave.The bar, which is described as a  dive  on Facebook, unfortunately bit off more than it could chew as the two women turned out to be lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union. Abre  Conner and Novella Coleman, the two women treated so horribly, wrote an article on the ACLU blog describing their experience:Let s recap. Four white employees at a bar in Fresno called the police to kick out two Black women (who happen to be ACLU attorneys) and who appeared to be the only Black people there.These kinds of signs have been illegal in California since the Unruh Civil Rights Act in 1959 and nationally since a 1964 U.S. Supreme Court ruling outlawed segregation.When the police arrived, several customers explained to the officers that the bar staff were enforcing the rule against us only. Some told the police that a one drink rule did not exist. Others even tried to buy us drinks. But the bartenders wouldn t let them. And still, the police forced us two Black women in the bar to leave. Police departments are supposed to enforce criminal laws and threats to public safety, not enforce personal biases.The bartender and police claimed to be exercising the business  supposed  right  to refuse service. This sounds too much like when the country still had  colored  sections and racially segregated water fountains. But this happened in March 2016.Oh those poor, dumb racists. By now they have to be aware that they messed with the wrong people.

Using nuclear weapons, meanwhile, would cause destruction on a scale that would draw serious condemnations from our allies and would also be a war crime if dropped on a city.Both ideas are so bad, in fact, that even Fox s own right-wing military expert smacked them down and lambasted them for not only not having served in the military but for not doing any research. None of the political wannabes, none of the aspirants have done their homework. None served in the military   they re all too important   but at least do your homework, guys. Now if you want to use a nuclear weapon on Islamic State, tell me: What s the target? What s the operational advantage? How would you deal with the ramifications for allies? It s the kind of thing people throw out there, and it s just goofy loose talk. But Peters also went on to specifically target Ted Cruz. When Ted Cruz talks about  carpet bombing,  I get the sense he thinks it s dropping carpets out of an airplane,  Peters said.  You ve got to know what the basic terms mean. Peters and Kennedy both had a good laugh at Cruz s expense talking about how he ll probably load up planes with debris taken from homes and drop it on unsuspecting people in the Middle East. I ve got all these remnants from when I redid my guest house! I ll just drop  em on ISIS!  Kennedy said.  Exactly, Carpet Warehouse,  Peters replied.  But seriously, there was one point where I really got angry. And then Peters set his sights on Trump. When Trump was challenged about the military and him giving an unlawful order, and the military not obeying it, he said,  Oh, they ll obey it.  Well no, Mr. Trump   our military takes an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. They obey the lawful orders of the Commander-in-Chief. But if the Commander-in-Chief, the president, ever gives an order that conflicts with the Constitution, the Constitution winds   hands down, every time. So I just wish these guys would   you know, come on, if you won t do the homework, guys, get your staffers to do some for you. In short, Cruz and Trump do not possess the ability to lead our military. They would use our armed forces to commit war crimes and would cause a constitutional crisis by giving orders to the military that our soldiers would likely refuse to follow.Ralph Peters may be a right-winger who constantly disrespects President Obama, but he s on point about Trump and Cruz and their inability to be a competent commander-in-chief.Featured image: Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

First, Cruz railed against Obama for not flying immediately to Brussels   when not even European leaders responded this way. Secondly, Cruz issued a hysterical demand for police to  patrol and secure Muslim-American neighborhoods, effectively placing Muslim citizens in a police state.The idea drew a swift and sharp response from President Obama, who reminded the Texas senator:As far as the notion of having surveillance of neighborhoods where Muslims are present, I just left a country that engages in that kind of neighborhood surveillance. Which, by the way, the father of Senator Cruz escaped for America, the land of the free. The notion that we would start down that slippery slope makes absolutely no sense.The President was backed up by furious comments from NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton, who saw the consequences when his police force implemented similar tactics in the past. He said: He doesn t know what the hell he is talking about To be frank with you, while he s running around here, he probably has some Muslim officers guarding him. Now Trevor Noah has piled in with a brutal dropkick of Ted Cruz over the matter, which begins: First of all, you re a sanctimonious jackass, Second of all, President Obama doesn t need to go to Belgium for them to know that he s an ally. It s not like all the European presidents went to Belgium after the attacks   and they re within driving distance. Then Noah turns to the President s comments that we cannot let terrorists achieve their core aim   which is to sow terror in us, saying: It s very important for us to not respond with fear. Then, turning to Cruz s attempt to do exactly that, by in turn terrorizing the American Muslim community in response, Noah says: Unfortunately, there are always those who use these times to score political points,  Adding, Terrorists win when we allow them to disrupt our way of life. While Cruz may persuade the right-wing of his party that persecuting American Muslims for the actions of a handful of Muslims in Belgium is a good idea.

They call the shooter a  lone wolf  or  mentally ill  and point out this his sister s college roommate was a Democrat. The gun had nothing to do with it, and had there been more guns in the school it wouldn t have gone down how it did.On that one they are correct. Most experts agree that if you put more guns in a dangerous situation, especially where people are running and panicking, you re going to end up with a deadly crossfire and more people will die senselessly. Still, the NRA-controlled Republican party stands by their platform of more guns for everyone, no matter who, in every situation, no matter what. Going out for breakfast? Bring your gun; a criminal (who has every right to a gun) might be there with a gun. Headed to the movies? Arm yourself. Some mentally ill guy with a gun (who has every right to carry it) may be there looking to calm the voices in his head.Guns, guns, guns. With more than 300 million instruments of death in circulation, not including the homemade versions, the likelihood that we ll ever see an end to the senseless violence is pretty slim.

What better way to make them eat their own stupid words than at their official clown convention. The petition, a masterpiece of leftist trollery, takes aim at the Party, its leaders and base by calling for the following five points of action:1. From the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland: A suspension of their policy preventing the open carry of firearms on the premises of the arena from July 18-21, 2016 to coincide with the Republican National Convention.2. From the National Rifle Association: An immediate condemnation of the egregious affront to the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution constituted by the  gun-free zone  loophole to the state law.3. From Ohio Governor John Kasich: A concerted effort to use his executive authority to override the  gun-free zone  loophole being exploited by the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.4. From Reince Priebus and the Republican National Committee: An explanation of how a venue so unfriendly to Second Amendment rights was chosen for the Republican Convention. Further, we demand a contingency plan to relocate the convention to another location should the Quicken Loans Arena refuse to honor the constitutional rights of the RNC guests to open carry firearms during the convention.5. From all Republican candidates for President: You have been brave in raising awareness about the immense dangers posed by  gun-free zones.  In order to ensure the safety of your supporters, delegates and all attendees at the convention in July, you must call upon the RNC to rectify this affront to our Second Amendment freedoms and insist upon a suspension of the Quicken Loans Arena s unconstitutional  gun-free zone  loophole.

Alabama Governor Robert Bentley (R- Of Course) has been accused of having an affair with a woman he describes as his  closest aide.  He has, however conceded that he did have conversations of a sexual nature with his Senior Political adviser, a woman by the name of Rebekah Mason. When news of the scandal broke via a leaked tape Bentley, of course, went into damage control mode and is pretending to be remorseful: Since that time I have apologized to members of my family, to Mrs. Mason and her family and I apologized then for any conversations and behavior then that was inappropriate. Today I want to apologize to the people of the state of Alabama and once again I want to apologize to my family. I am truly sorry and I accept full responsibility. Bentley then went on to re enforce the point that there was no  physical affair  with Mason: I want everyone to know though that I have never had a physical affair with Mrs. Mason. I can assure the people of Alabama I have never done anything illegal. I have never asked any member of my staff or any cabinet member to lie despite what the former ALEA secretary said today. Physical affair or not, that tape was certainly scandalous enough on its own. Here is just one part of that tape: When I m standing behind you, pull you in real close, put my hands on your breasts, put my hands under you .if we gonna do what we did the other day, we re gonna have to start locking the door.  (paraphrased)Here is audio of that tape:Well, that certainly sounds like it went beyond phone sex for sure, but of course there is no way to prove it. Another piece of the scandal is even worse, because it involves the firing of Alabama Law Enforcement Secretary Spencer Collier. Apparently, there was some kind of investigation into the possibility of criminal activity while Collier was in office. Collier, however, tells a different story. He seems to believe he was fired due to his warnings to Bentley regarding the sex scandal and other internal wrongdoing. From Al.com:In denying he has done anything wrong as the state s top cop, Collier on Tuesday and again on Wednesday charged that his agency had come across evidence of an affair between Bentley and Mason, an affair Collier said he warned Bentley that could lead to criminal charges if Bentley were found to have misused state resources in carrying out the relationship.Collier also said Bentley placed him on leave a month ago and then fired him Tuesday because he refused an order by Bentley to lie about why Collier was not to provide a sworn statement to the attorney general s office involving personalities in the criminal case against House Speaker Mike Hubbard.Here is video of Collier speaking on the whole debacle:If this is true, Bentley SHOULD be charged, and Collier should be given his job back. These GOP hypocrites need to ALL be voted out of office come November. They are unfit to serve decent people everywhere.Time to resign, Gov. Bentley.

Trump is yet to release a single word condemning this genuine threat to life, and any right-thinking world, that should end his campaign.55 year old William Celli, of Richmond in California, received a 90 day jail term and three years probation for a plot to explode a bomb in an act of domestic terrorism against Muslims.The court heard how Celli yelled, I m going to kill you all!  outside the Islamic Society of West Contra Costa County.Later, the bomb squad was called to his home, where they found an explosive device which Celli had planned to use against the mosque. The would-be terrorist accepted a plea deal.The case is another cause of great concern for the Muslim community, who have faced a spike in hate crimes since the San Bernardino shootings. Muslims are being attacked on the streets, and their places of worship are being violated and even burned to the ground. While responsible lawmakers and political leaders attempt to bring America together, Donald Trump has staked his campaign on quite the opposite.After the attacks on Paris, Trump called for a ban on all Muslims entering the US, even Muslim Americans attempting to return from holiday. After the Brussel s bombings, he made further despicable comments against Muslims in general while failing to even express sympathy with those who lost their lives of loved ones.This attitude, the leveraging of fear into hate, has done wonders for his presidential campaign   but very little for social cohesion in the country. Now, one of his own supporters has taken the next logical step inside Trump s logic, he went to war with Muslims.As Raw Story reports:He appears to be a strong admirer of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump   who was stoking Islamaphobic fears in the weeks prior to Celli s arrest in the wake of mass shootings in Paris and San Bernardino, California. Donald trumps on again I m happy leaders okay but this guys a great point man I ll follow this MAN to the end of the world,  Celli posted Oct. 21. Donald Trump s on again I m feeling good about myself,  he posted Oct. 28. While Trump commented immediately with gross generalization about Muslims in the wake of terrorist acts half way round the world   he is yet to utter a single word on this attempted act of domestic terrorism. He has neither denounced Celli, or the views the wannabe attacker espoused. He has also failed to reassure the Muslim community of any actions he would take as President to protect their lives, businesses and places of worship from such domestic terrorists.This is because Donald Trump fails to understand the central responsibility of being President of the United States. If elected, he has to be President of all of it; every man, woman and child in the country, whether they voted for him or not, whether they share his religion or world view or not.This may fly straight over the heads of die-hard Trump supporters, willfully ignored. But it must not be overlooked by the broader American public. It is moments like this that will kill the Trump campaign when his race to win over Republicans is complete, and he is faced with the impossible task of winning over a very different kind of audience.Featured image via Facebook""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And it almost would have worked if it weren t for a meddling NBC reporter who pointed out the massive elephant in the room.Without missing a beat, NBC s Hallie Jackson stepped up to ask the one question Cruz didn t want to hear: Are you more loyal to the Republican Party  or your wife? His flailing response speaks volumes.A clearly unimpressed Jackson asks Cruz to explicitly say whether or not he would support Donald Trump as president if he got the nomination. Cruz was left temporarily speechless, before weakly saying the question was irrelevant because Trump was going to lose. Jackson didn t let up:Jackson: That s not answering the question, Senator.Cruz: I am answering the question. Donald Trump will not be the nominee.Jackson: He s leading right now and you just looked into that camera and said he was a coward. Will you support him as the nominee?Cruz: Donald Trump will not be the nomineeWhat makes Jackson s questions so brutal is that for Cruz, he s always struggled to distance himself from Trump while at the same time copying many of his ideas. And like many Republicans, Cruz has repeatedly said he would support the eventual nominee whoever it was, even as he publicly attacked Trump. Just earlier this month, Cruz was still adamant that party loyalty meant everything. My answer is the same. I committed at the outset. I will support the Republican nominee, whoever it is,  Cruz said.Making things even more awkward, Cruz and Trump spent the early part of the election praising each other. Cruz would live to regret tweets like this one.In the end, with Trump s sizable lead in the primaries, Cruz will need to decide what he will do if Trump wins. As he calls Trump a  sniveling coward  on camera, he may soon be faced with having to grovel at Trump s feet (just as his former fellow candidates Chris Christie and Ben Carson have already done).

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Before Senator Bernie Sanders popularized stepping up to the Democratic establishment, which has been overrun by corporate and big money influences, Zephyr Teachout made waves in New York State by challenging Democratic incumbent, Governor Andrew Cuomo, to a primary race in 2014. Despite being heavily out funded by Governor Cuomo, who received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from corporations and wealthy interests, Ms. Teachout received 34 percent of the vote, including winning many counties in the state, including Albany County, home of the state s capital. Although she lost, her campaign, the first she ever ran, was a blow to the myth that elected officials, particularly incumbents, are invincible in elections from their own political party.In January 2016, Ms. Teachout, currently as Associate Law Professor at Fordham University, announced she is running for New York s 19th Congressional District seat. I m running to raise up the voice that people have been shut out of politics. I think you can see across the political spectrum people are really frustrated by congress, and by politics that are increasingly driven by big money,  said Ms. Teachout in a phone interview.Ms. Teachout cited as one of the broad issues she plans to tackle in congress, is campaign finance reform, especially in regards to overturning the SCOTUS Citizens United ruling in 2010. I ve already been working in the last several years to promote Congressman John Sarbanes  (D-MD) bill, which is basically modeled off of the public financing system in New York City,  she said.  Congress unfortunately is trapped by congress members having to spend 50 percent of their time raising money. A public financing system like what Congressman Sarbanes has proposed, The Government by The People Act, would allow congress members to raise money from small donors and still have enough to reach all the voters. I think shutting down the revolving door between lobbyists and government is essential. In tandem to the issue of campaign financing being overhauled by corporations, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has received a lot of criticism from Republicans, Independents, and Democrats, including Ms. Teachout, for heavily favoring corporations and handing to them unprecedented leverage over governments. The TPP is a continuation of NAFTA ad even worse than NAFTA,  said Ms. Teachout.  Instead of changing direction and building towards a 21st century trade policy, the TPP doubles down on failed trade policy. Negotiations over Trans-Pacific Partnership between the United States and 11 other countries began during the Bush administration, and has been pushed by the Obama administration. Both Democratic Presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders have opposed the agreement, while Republican Presidential Candidates have expressed mixed feelings over it, with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz against it, but Governor Kasich in favor. Ms. Teachout added: I m actually quite hopeful we are going to stop it. I think a year ago you would have said  the big guns have this locked down , but there has been a truly extraordinary swelling of grassroots energy from Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all across the board against it. People are saying this is the wrong direction, we actually want more made in America, we want to buy locally owned goods and we want to be making law through a democratic process. One of the real problems of the TPP for me is it shuts you out of the process, and that is fundamental. Instead of making policy through congress which has its own problems, its making policy in the backroom, and that s no way to make international or basic economic policy in our country. New York s 19th Congressional District includes Sullivan, Ulster, Delaware, Otsego, Schoharie, Greene and Columbia Counties and parts of Montgomery, Rensselaer and Dutchess Counties. Current Representative of the district, Republican Chris Gibson announced he is retiring, leaving the seat wide open. Ms. Teachout is currently a favorite to win, she won almost every county in the district against Governor Cuomo in 2014. In the Democratic Primaries, she faces challenges from John Kehoe, a 29-year-old self-described moderate Democrat who runs a recording studio in the Hudson Valley, and Will Yandik, a town councilman from Columbia County, though popular consensus in the district s local Democratic Parties favor Ms. Teachout, according to the Poughkeepsie Journal.The Democratic Primaries take place on June 28th, 2016. On the Republican side, it will be a toss-up mainly between Andrew Heaney, a small businessman and graduate from Harvard Business School, and John Faso, a former New York State Assemblyman. Mr. Faso, who has hired Bill O Reilly as a communications consultant, has criticized Heaney for donating to President Obama s 2008 campaign. Mr. Heaney has also been accused of illegally coordinating with a Super-Pac he created, the New York Jobs Council.As progressivism has made its mark on the 2016 presidential election from the popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders  campaign, it has inspired progressive candidates across the country to run for office on similar platforms. Ms. Teachout s advice for those progressive candidates who are standing up to make their mark in a primary against an establishment backed candidate, as she did in 2014 against Governor Andrew Cuomo; spend as much time as you can on the ground listening to people, not in a closed room listening to donors. There s an extraordinary strength in the deep American grassroots and it s pretty exciting to see what could happen if you put a lot more trust in people.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""The world no longer sees Donald Trump as a joke, they see him as a significant threat to international security and a stable economy.When Donald Trump first announced his candidacy for the presidency, most people in America and around the globe thought that he would be just another clown candidate made possible by the ineptitude and extremism of the Republican Party as in years past when the likes of Michelle Bachmann and Herman Cain entered the race.But this year, conservatives look determined to use Trump as their own personal battering ram to destroy the federal government even if it means bringing about perpetual war and the disintegration of the world economy in the process.And that s why the Global Forecasting Service has officially rated Trump a high impact threat even though they believe it is unlikely he will beat his eventual Democratic opponent. But just in case he does win, the GFS analysed what is at risk if he should somehow ascend to the presidency.According to analysis by the GFS:Thus far Mr. Trump has given very few details of his policies   and these tend to be prone to constant revision   but a few themes have become apparent. First, he has been exceptionally hostile towards free trade, including notably NAFTA, and has repeatedly labelled China as a  currency manipulator.  He has also taken an exceptionally right-wing stance on the Middle East and jihadi terrorism, including, among other things, advocating the killing of families of terrorists and launching a land incursion into Syria to wipe out IS (and acquire its oil). In the event of a Trump victory, his hostile attitude to free trade, and alienation of Mexico and China in particular, could escalate rapidly into a trade war   and at the least scupper the Trans-Pacific Partnership between the US and 11 other American and Asian states signed in February 2016. His militaristic tendencies towards the Middle East (and ban on all Muslim travel to the US) would be a potent recruitment tool for jihadi groups, increasing their threat both within the region and beyond.In other words, Trump would be a catastrophe for the United States and the world. His warmongering against the Middle East and hatred of Muslims could result in new wars and increased terrorist attacks and his hostility towards Mexico and China threaten the economic stability President Obama has worked so hard to rebuild after the Great Recession of 2008.Furthermore, Trump has inflamed racial tensions across the nation to the point where it feels like his continued candidacy is a powder keg waiting to explode into a full-fledged race war. Trump has also expressed hostility toward women and the LGBT community along with having a decidedly anti-science stance. His anti-science stance alone is enough to endanger the world considering climate change is rapidly becoming irreversible. Should Trump become president, it could be many more years before the United States participates in climate initiatives again.The Global Forecasting Service also warns in their conclusion that while Democrats and Republicans in Congress will likely oppose Trump s more radical policies, it would mean at least four more years of nothing getting done as Congress and the White House obstruct each other.Although we do not expect Mr Trump to defeat his most likely Democratic contender, Hillary Clinton, there are risks to this forecast, especially in the event of a terrorist attack on US soil or a sudden economic downturn. It is worth noting that the innate hostility within the Republican hierarchy towards Mr Trump, combined with the inevitable virulent Democratic opposition, will see many of his more radical policies blocked in Congress   albeit such internal bickering will also undermine the coherence of domestic and foreign policymaking.In short, the best thing Americans can do for ourselves and the world is vote against Trump in November. Because our safety and financial health depend on it. Featured image via Flickr ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

That means that the White House must provide a public response on the matter.If it was not clear that people are furious over the Arizona primary fiasco, it should be now. Thousands of voter were forced to wait for hours in line during the election. Phoenix s mayor, Greg Stanton, has even sent a letter to the Justice Department demanding that they launch an investigation into the primary. Maricopa County appears to be the county hit hardest by the election disaster. Maricopa County is a racially diverse area, meaning people of color were also disproportionately hurt by this disaster.Here is the full text of the petition: Petition to have the Obama Administration investigate the voter fraud and voter suppression on 3/22/2016 in ARIZONA. Numerous voters who switched from Independent to Democrat could not vote and were turned away or given provisional ballots which in turn were never counted. We the people of the United States of America find this act alarming and would like a complete investigation to uncover the violations that occurred during the Arizona voting on 3/22/2016 and prosecute those responsible to the fullest extent of the law. In Maricopa County, there was only one polling location available for every 108,000 residents. That s because County officials decided to cut the number of polling locations down by 85% compared to the number of 2008 presidential preference election.To further demonstrate the slap in the face that was the Arizona primary election, the Associated Press began projecting Clinton as the winner of the race while hundreds of voters still stood in line waiting to vote. Regardless of whether those still waiting in line may have changed the outcome of the election, we live in a democracy where every vote matters. Announcing the projected winner(s) of an election sends a message to those who waited hours in lines that their attempts to participate in our democracy were nothing but a waste of time.Then there is the matter of the thousands of voters who waited hours in line, only to be told that they cannot vote due their party affiliation. Those people were given the option to fill out a provisional ballot. That sounds like a good solution to a very unfortunate problem. However, Arizona has a long history of provisional ballots being rejected, at rates double that of states with double the size of Arizona s population.This hurts voters that the Democrats need the most. Namely young and or first-time voters and those who wish to jump the sinking ship that is the Republican Party and those registered as Independents. An estimated 4,000 people in Maricopa County changed their political party affiliation from Independent to Democrat prior to the election.Featured Image Photo by Jonathan Gibby/Getty Images ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The bill worked it s way through the legislature so fast that Democrats didn t even get the chance to read it over.According to Buzzfeed:House Bill 2 mandates that state law supersedes all local ordinances concerning wages, employment, and public accommodations. It also restricts single-sex public restrooms and locker rooms in publicly run facilities to people of the same sex on their birth certificate.In addition, it bans transgender students from school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity   teeing up a potential legal clash with the federal government, which has found that civil rights laws ban transgender discrimination in schools.North Carolina literally just enshrined discrimination into state law, and all because conservative  Christians  testified that the Charlotte ordinance and other ordinances in nine other jurisdictions would pave the way for sex offenders to prey upon women, a falsehood that McCrory happily repeated as he defended putting his bigoted signature on the bill. The basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings, a restroom or locker room, for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of Charlotte,  McCrory said in a statement that explained why he signed the bill into law.The Charlotte ordinance, he continued,  defies common sense and basic community norms by allowing, for example, a man to use a woman s bathroom, shower or locker room. However, Buzzfeed notes that there has never been a single example in 17 states and 225 cities of LGBT protections being used to defend predatory behavior.Yet, Republicans passed the bill into law anyway, and that could lead to a mass exodus of businesses from the state. The state of Georgia is experiencing such an exodus right now as corporations threaten to leave if Governor Nathan Deal signs a discriminatory  religious liberty  bill that would allow bigotry against gay people. Disney and Marvel have already promised to take their business elsewhere and the NFL has threatened to take the Superbowl away from Atlanta. If a business backlash can happen in Georgia, it can happen in North Carolina, too. And that means North Carolina is going to face economic punishment along with having to waste millions of taxpayer dollars defending the new bill when the lawsuits begin to be filed.Republicans have run North Carolina into the ground.

Grays then did what most drivers would do if they were in the same situation   he yelled at the person driving the vehicle for his reckless behavior.What Grays didn t know is that the vehicle was an unmarked police car. It is at this point that four plainclothes police officers get out of the unmarked police car and begin to harass Grays. The incident was recorded by passersby on their cell phones. You can watch the video below.Grays was eventually ticketed with resisting arrest. He was then handcuffed and put in the back of the unmarked police car where he was taken away. It is not a crime for someone to voice outrage after almost being struck by a vehicle   It is not a crime to state that you re angry at someone who almost hit you. That is not a crime,  Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said during a press conference on Tuesday.Adams wants the four police officers involved in the arrest to be investigated.

When the police arrested Grays, they also left his mail truck unattended   possibly violating several federal procedures. Adams thinks that the police should be punished for any violations of federal procedure that may have happened. I believe there were federal violations. Number one, leaving that truck unsecured. Number, two, interrupting the delivery of mail. There are clear NYPD procedures when you are arresting a federal employee. We don t know if even those basic procedures were followed.

Right now, if a student finds something offensive and complains about it, universities immediately open up an investigation into that teacher s actions, no matter how  questionable  that complaint is.According to the report, the failure of the federal government to make  meaningful distinctions between conduct and speech or otherwise distinguish between hostile environment sexual harassment  is putting academic freedom and free speech in jeopardy. The general counsel of the association and the chairwoman of the subcommittee who wrote the report, Risa L. Lieberwitz spoke to the NY Times, saying: We need to protect academic speech and the freedom that goes with academic speech, as well as due process. Universities are acting in a way that is overly precipitous as well as applying overly broad definitions of sexual harassment because they are afraid of scrutiny. The report even gives examples to support their claims. One of those was regarding Sociology Professor Patty Adler s class, Deviance in US Society,  at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Adler had taught the class for more than twenty years and each semester around five hundred students enrolled in it, but in 2013 some of the students complained that her class  constituted sexual harassment :At the conclusion of the term, undergraduate teaching assistants participated in and witnessed role-playing exercises featuring subjects relevant to course material involving the global sex trade: these performances animated character types, such as an  Eastern European  slave whore,  a pimp, a  bar whore,  and a high-end escort.  Adler s Dean offered her a buyout for early retirement and indicated if she did not accept the offer, she could incur penalties up to and including forfeiture of her retirement benefits.Her other option was to return to the classroom but never teach the course again. When students, faculty and advocacy groups found out what was happening they protested the school s ultimatum and eventually the university relented and welcomed her back without any conditions. However, the incident took such a toll on her that she only stayed for one semester and then retired.Professor Adler is not alone, similar incidents have happened all across the country and that is the violation of free speech and academic freedom the AAUP found so troubling. The group is not advocating sexual harassment, they are just asking that the government draw clearer lines between what is and what isn t harassment so that students can be properly educated.Right now, the lines are so blurry that colleges and universities are doing a disservice to the students who pay thousands of dollars for a well-rounded curriculum. Of course, these schools should act if a professor is violating the law, but there is a huge difference between harassment and  well, this is an uncomfortable, intellectual topic.  Nobody benefits when schools don t use common sense when investigating claims.Featured image via Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

After you see this, the levels of rage you ll experience will make you wish Ryan had just kept it between himself and the Lord. Seriously, the smug smile on his face is enough to make you sick:I used to give up food, like beer or ice cream, for #Lent.

He s dead serious. In the video, he said: I used to give up beer, or ice cream, or pop. But I ve given up so many things over the years, food-wise, that I ve decided to switch my Lenten vows to character deficiencies or problems I ve had. For Ryan to refer to anxiety as a  character deficiency  is reprehensible. It is something that around 40 million American adults suffer from regularly, and can lead to serious physical issues such as ulcers and respiratory problems.Ryan, with his amazing amount of white privilege and insensitivity, referred to the everyday stresses that many Americans face as an actual debilitating disorder. How nice is it that Ryan can CHOOSE to give up anxiety for 40 days? People who actually suffer from anxiety don t even have that choice, and would probably give anything to live without anxiety for just ONE day. What Ryan said has only further stigmatized a real mental health issue.The stigma against mental health is a serious matter in this country. As discussions about mental health are usually delivered in a punch line or decried in public, it s no surprise that only a quarter of those with mental health issues believe that others understand and are compassionate about their condition. Because of heavily engrained stereotypes about mental illness, many people will never seek treatment and get the help they need.Maybe if Ryan is looking for more Lent ideas, he could give up shaming people.

Between 2008 and 2016, officials eliminated 85 percent of polling locations, leaving just 60 sites open, to serve a community of more than four million people.On Wednesday, community leaders and angry citizens took to the streets in protest of obvious voter suppression used in Maricopa County. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Election protest in downtown PhoenixPosted by Marc Liverman on Wednesday, March 23, 2016Their complaints have not fallen on deaf ears.In his letter to the Justice Department, Stanton points out that the reduction in polling places primarily impacted Black and Latino communities. A prime example, in Phoenix, a community in which the majority of voters are Black and Latino, there was just one polling place for every 108,000 voters on Tuesday.On the other hand, primarily white communities like Cave Creek/Carefree, there was one polling site per 8,500 voters. The same holds true in other majority-white communities, including Paradise Valley, which had one polling location per 13,000 voters and Fountain Hills, where there was one polling site for every 22,500 voters.But that s just the beginning of the story. On Wednesday, Sondra Carr, a Phoenix resident posted an account of what she saw on election day in Maricopa County. After standing in line for hours, Carr and her son finally entered the polling station.Here s what she says happened next.When my son and I voted, there were SEVEN voting  booths    these were cardboard dividers for privacy. There were seven. Think about that   there are seven of the very things that are needed to vote and look to cost about a dollar fifty, so I m sorry but I don t buy the idea I ve since heard that this was a money-saving decision. Why were there not more? But that didn t even matter because when my son and I entered, there were no other voters inside. When I walked up to the booths, there were no other voters in them and while I was voting, only my own son came to stand next to me. They were purposefully trickling people in, leaving two-thirds of the booths empty while 2000 people waited outside for hours.Thousands of others, who waited for hours to cast their vote, discovered that their party affiliation had somehow been changed on the voter registration rolls. These voters were either turned away altogether or forced to cast a provisional ballot.As Mayor Stanton also states, Arizona has long, documented history of throwing out provisional ballots. According to Stanton s letter, since 2006, Arizona officials have rejected more than 121,000 provisional ballots. That number does not include the thousands of voters who were improperly forced to vote by provisional ballot during the March 22 Presidential Preference Election.While election officials have attempted to cast blame on Independent voters, who they claim came out to vote in Tuesday s election even though they legally were barred from participating, there are two things wrong with this narrative.First, many people who have been registered democrats for years discovered that their party affiliation had been changed without their knowledge or permission.Second, the media, Arizona election officials and others also bear a large amount of blame for confusion on the part of independent voters, if they did indeed show up in record numbers at the polls. (There s no actual evidence that this even happened.)Arizona s Presidential Preference Election, which was held on March 22, is not the state s primary election.The state holds its primary election on August 30. The actual primary does not include presidential candidates. Anyone can vote in that election, including independent voters.The Presidential Preference Election is a closed election. Only registered members of a political party can participate in that election.So yes, independent voters can indeed vote in the state s primary. And no, Tuesday s Presidential Preference Election was not the state s primary. Independent voters were not allowed to participate in that election, which was consistently referred to as the  Arizona primary,  when it actually wasn t.Blaming voters for trying to vote is a disgusting tactic, especially given the confusing system and the horrifying lack of clarity from the media and election officials.Mayor Stanton spoke with KPNX on Wednesday. Watch the video below. The Phoenix mayor is not the only politician to criticize Tuesday s election fiasco. On Wednesday, Gov. Doug Ducey called the long lines and voter registration issues  unacceptable,  while also calling for changes to the state s closed Presidential Preference Election.Image credit: video screen capture via Marc Liverman on Facebook ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They re afraid, and for good reason, that if when Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee, he s going to be crushed so badly in the general election that he ll deliver both chambers of Congress to the Democratic Party:The efforts are being driven by major players such as the Koch brothers  political network, which has already begun laying groundwork in Colorado, Ohio and Pennsylvania, along with the Crossroads organizations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.The behemoth Koch operation   which aims to spend almost $900 million before the November elections   is now considering abandoning Trump as a nominee and focusing its resources on behalf of GOP congressional candidates.My colleague Korie Beth Brown wrote about how Trump is putting the heavily gerrymandered House into play and this move by the GOP Donor Class confirms it: Trump is leading the Republican Party to electoral annihilation.Hooray!According to WaPo, instead of dumping a billion dollars into winning the White House, the Kochs and their fellow oligarchs are planning to spend all of that money just to keep what they already have:A key element of the strategy will be a springtime wave of television ads that slam Democratic contenders and tout Republican incumbents as attuned to hometown concerns. Strategists hope the efforts will help inoculate congressional candidates against association with Trump s incendiary remarks. If there are crosscurrents that are potentially harmful, the most important thing you can do is aggressively localize the race   the things that matter back home, the problems you re solving,  said Steven Law, a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who leads the American Crossroads super PAC and a suite of related groups.While that sounds like a good idea, Republicans no longer actually SOLVE problems. Instead, they create them and then blame Obama and the Democrats. When your entire strategy has been unprecedented obstruction for 7 years, it s going to be hard to tout your accomplishments.Even with all of that advertising, it s going to be very difficult to get conservatives to be enthusiastic about voting with Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. Combine that with the abject horror that liberals and Independents will experience and you re looking at a huge turnout from the left matched against a depressed turnout from the right.

If you re talking about doing what she wants to do, which is to rally our forces against ISIS, you gotta come back to the White House, you gotta sit in the Situation Room, and you can t leave until you come up with a plan,  Giuliani said.O Reilly then whined about President Obama not dropping everything to go back to Washington once news broke of the terrorist attack on Brussels.Ever since the attack, which killed over 30 and injured hundreds, conservatives have been unfairly criticizing President Obama for not canceling his trip in Cuba to hole up in the Situation Room.The problem is that President Obama can t really do anything beyond offering condolences and assistance if Belgium asks for help. Obama offered both in the aftermath of the attack. Conservatives have also said President Obama should go to Belgium, but that would only distract the first responders and police officers from doing their job since security of the president would require lots of preparation and man power.Giuliani then went off the rails into accusations that are nothing short of slander. She helped create ISIS,  Giuliani bellowed. Hillary Clinton could be considered a founding member of ISIS. When asked how Clinton created ISIS, Giuliani told O Reilly that she did so  by being part of an administration that withdrew from Iraq  and  by being part of an administration that allowed Maliki to run Iraq into the ground. O Reilly really didn t do much to challenge Giuliani either, which is yet another example of the lack of journalistic ethics that he and Fox News are known for.In the end, Giuliani said Clinton should have resigned as Secretary of State because  that s what a patriot does. Here s the video via YouTube.The fact is, however, that it was President Bush who signed the withdrawal of forces agreement with Iraq and helped install Nouri al-Maliki as the Iraqi Prime Minister in 2006.And let s not forget that Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in the first place, which destabilized the region by removing Saddam Hussein, a traditional enemy of Iran, from power. That alone caused a power vacuum in the region which allowed Iran to have more influence in the region while creating the conditions for ISIS to rise.Bill O Reilly ought to be ashamed of himself for allowing Giuliani to make such outrageous claims, and Hillary Clinton should smack Giuliani with a lawsuit because she clearly has a case against him for slander.

The former presidential candidate reluctantly said that Republicans would  probably  lose the 2016 election due to the extremely unlikeable qualities of leading GOP candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.Graham had backed Cruz after ending his own campaign for GOP nomination, clearly because the Texas senator was the only alternative to Trump. Graham made it perfectly clear that the endorsement didn t mean that he suddenly liked Cruz, a man that Graham previously joked about murdering. Not to mention that earlier this year, Graham said that choosing between Trump and Cruz was like being shot or poisoned. What does it really matter? But now, Graham seems like he s accepted the fact that the Democrats have the 2016 race in the bag. During the interview, he said: We can lose in 2016 and probably will. Here s my concern. Trump gets wiped out. Ted, I don t know if he can beat Hillary Clinton or not but at least we ve got a fighting chance.If Trump is the standard-bearer, it s not about 2016, it s about losing the heart and soul of the conservative movement.

Both Trump and Cruz are extremely polarizing to voters. Ted Cruz has an uncanny ability to make most people   whether politicians, family members or voting Americans   hate him (which might be linked to the way his face looks). And Trump tends to turn many GOP voters off for his vulgar language and constant flip-flopping on policies. Both of these candidates are an embarrassment to the Republican party, and Graham was dead-on when he said it would take generations  for the GOP to recover from this election cycle.

Over 170,000 people attended this year, and with it came several arrests, but one of the most horrific was the rape of a tourist from Brazil, which was blamed by a Florida judge due to the festival.Transit worker for the Department of Transportation and Public Works in Miami, Carl Lee Wilt, allegedly took the 22-year-old girl into a utility closet after she was prevented from boarding a public transit train for being too intoxicated, according to the police report.A witness harassed police officers in the area for 15 minutes until they decided to knock on the utility door, which Wilt opened five minutes later with his pants undone. Police said Wilt admitted to sexually assaulting the girl, but apparently stopped when she defecated herself.The girl told officers she had no recollection of how she met Wilt or what happened during their encounter.Miami-Dade judge Nushin Sayfie ordered Wilt be held without bond, who faces kidnapping and sexual battery charges, but then proceeded to blame the victim and the Ultra Music Festival for the rape. This is why we shouldn t let our kids go to Ultra   right here,  Sayfie said, who was appointed by former Republican Florida Governor Charlie Crist in 2007. Her argument is straight out of the 1984 Kevin Bacon film, Footloose, in which a small town has banned dancing and rock music.

One study showed that after just one hour of education on sexual assault, men were less likely to believe myths about rape or consider being sexually coercive,  wrote Suzannah Weiss in a 2015 article for Bustle.  Once we recognize that sexual assault can happen to anyone, we can stop wondering what the victim did to deserve it and start wondering what allowed the perpetrator to go through with it.

Ms. Dawson, who has appeared in movies such as Sin City, Clerks II, Death Proof, Grindhouse, and Men In Black II, ripped into the DNC and emphasized how important the stakes are in this presidential race. I am so happy that you re here,  Ms. Dawson told the crowd of over 7,000 Bernie Sanders  supporters.  Unfortunately the mass media said, don t even bother,  but I m glad you showed them what s up. Ms. Dawson is referring to the overwhelming lack of media coverage Bernie Sanders has received from mainstream media outlets compared to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. A report on the first eleven months of 2015 conducted by the Tyndall Report found Hillary Clinton received 113 minutes of coverage on CBS, ABC, and NBC nightly news broadcasts, with an additional 88 minutes dedicated to controversies surrounding her involvement in Benghazi and her private e-mail server as Secretary of State, which helped fuel her Democratic support base.In contrast, Senator Bernie Sanders received only ten minutes of coverage. While the mainstream media is partially to blame for the rise of Donald Trump as it has overwhelmingly focused on him so much that he doesn t even need to spend money on campaign marketing and advertising, they are also partially to blame for Hillary Clinton s victories with age demographics who receive the majority of their news from mainstream media (i.e. baby boomers). The youth has been on the right side of history on every issue. They talked about those hippie college kids when they were protesting against Vietnam. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who Bernie Sanders walked with, couldn t have done what he had done if it wasn t for high school students who said,  I m not afraid to do a sit-in.  They didn t listen to us when we said  no  on the bailout. They didn t talk about how beautiful and remarkable it was when people around the World marched for peace before the Iraq War,  added Ms. Dawson.She concluded the Bernie Sanders movement isn t about Democrats versus Republicans, its about the 99 percent rising up and saying  enough is enough  to the one percent. The Democratic Party, we haven t left them, they left us. This is an opportunity to turn the tide and change history. Do we really want someone who condoned mass incarceration? Who thinks the death penalty is OK? Who hesitates on environmental injustices and issues? Who thinks that regime change is an idea for foreign policy? No. What we need is bold leadership from a great leader whose time has come.  That leader is Senator Bernie Sanders.

Captain America: Civil War was just recently filmed at Pine Wood studios in Atlanta and such a massive production means jobs for people in Georgia and a boost in the economy.But if Georgia chooses to enshrine bigotry into law, Marvel will take their heroes elsewhere. Disney and Marvel are inclusive companies, and although we have had great experiences filming in Georgia, we will plan to take our business elsewhere should any legislation allowing discriminatory practices be signed into state law,  Disney said in a statement that should worry Georgia officials to the core.It makes sense that Disney would pull the Marvel Cinematic Universe away from Georgia if this bill passes.

That s in our interest, as it is in combating the Islamic State. That is, of course, total bullshit. ISIS has been slaughtering Muslims by the thousands for not being extreme enough. Sure, they re killing every OTHER religion they find, but the majority of their violence is reserved for their fellow Muslims.Curiously, Cotton seems to be lacking any and all empathy for them. Almost like he doesn t consider Muslims to be people. That s really the only way to talk about  moral imperatives  while ignoring the bulk of the victims of religious violence.That must be why he was one of the numerous Republicans that demanded all Syrian refugees be turned away from the United States   including children that were accused of being tiny terrorists. Where was his  moral imperative  then?Of course, once this proposal fails, Cotton will hold it up as  proof  that Christianity is under attack in America. Don t you see? The only POSSIBLE reason for not granting special privileges to Christians must be that liberals are trying to wipe out Christians! There s no way the Constitutional and (actual) moral prohibition against treating any one religion as superior (or inferior) could be involved.I wish I could say that this is an isolated incident but the two leading candidates for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, were just as repulsive in the wake of the attack.

New York is currently the only state that bans the popular MMA sport and this was the first time the State Assembly has ever brought it to a vote, despite the fact that the Senate has passed it seven years in a row.

Well, I should really like it. You have two nearly naked, hot men trying to dominate each other. That s gay porn with a different ending. I m going to assume that O Donnell, the brother of actress/comedian Rosie O Donnell, was trying to channel his sister and be funny with his dissenting opinion, but he failed miserably. He wasn t the only lawmaker to make a crazy comparison, Assemblyman Charles Barron said it was like slavery and police violence: You know how we feel about the chokehold in New York City. You can put him in a chokehold and the ref has to be determining whether he got choked enough or she got choked enough. This (sport) is not something we should legalize or regulate. That s taking it a little far. MMA fighters know exactly what their sport is about;  Eric Garner, however, did not expect the NYPD to choke him to death when he sold loose cigarettes. Comparing a sport to systematic police abuse is outrageous and offensive.When asked about the lawmakers  comparisons, Chris Weidman said: Some of the things they were saying were so ridiculous that I was actually happy and embarrassed for them for even bringing it up. It s things I ve heard people behind closed doors might be saying, but to hear them say it live and to the public, I actually thought it was pretty interesting   and probably good for us. I just thought it was embarrassing on their part. I have to agree with him, the lawmakers sounded ridiculous. We expect Republicans to make outlandish claims when they are arguing against something, but when Democrats do it, it s even more embarrassing.

But as I spent more time listening, and really learning the root causes of poverty, I realized I was wrong. A Republican admitting they were wrong about ANYTHING is like finding a four leaf clover in the Sahara. Finding a Republican that admits they were wrong to demonize the poor in America is like finding one on the Moon. But Ryan wasn t done, he made it absolutely clear what he meant: Takers  wasn t how to refer to a single mom stuck in a poverty trap, just trying to take care of her family.

So I stopped thinking about it that way and talking about it that way. But I didn t come out and say all this to be politically correct. I was just wrong.

He just didn t care until Trump threatened to utterly annihilate the Republican Party by telling the base that the rich don t give a damn about them.A few days ago, I wrote about the National Review, the right s premiere collection of thought leaders, dropping the pretense that the right-wing elites consider the rural poor to be the  real America.  Years of pent up hostility and derision come flooding out like a tidal wave of scorn. I wondered if this meant that the Republican coalition of the poor and the rich was finally ending. But then how would the rich hold on to power without their useful idiots to vote for them?Ryan s sudden reversal on poverty suggests that while the National Review is giving up on the poor, the Republican Party itself is not. By finally talking about poverty instead of spewing hate at the poor, Republicans may finally be ready to address the actual problem instead of simply trying to sweep it under the rug. They ll have to if they want to reclaim their base from Trump.It would be the absolute height of irony if Donald Trump forced the Republican Party to move away from the fringe in order to start governing responsibly again.Featured image via AI archives ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Two potential candidates for the office of President of the United States trading  Yo  wife!  insults   it is an embarrassment to the election process.It also comes hot on the heels of the worrying news that US elections have just been ranked worst among the longstanding democracies of the world. America came flat last. As the Washington Post puts it:What do Argentina, Costa Rica and Brazil have in common?They all outranked the United States in a comparison of election standards and procedures conducted by the Electoral Integrity Project. The United States ranked 47th worldwide, out of 139 countries.So what is it that has driven America to the bottom of a league table of which we should be on top? The report states: experts expressed concern about the quality of the electoral laws, voter registration, the process of drawing district boundaries, as well as the regulation of campaign finance, In short, the game is rigged to a degree in the United States, which it is not elsewhere in the developed world. This issue should be front and center in this election campaign, with candidates doing everything they can to restore the integrity of American democracy. Instead, the Republican candidates are busy sl*t-shaming each other s wives.The electorate deserve better, and they should vote for better.Featured image via Screengrab/Flickr Creative Commons ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This video draws out those difference in a stunning comparison.The video, put together by the brilliant team at Buzzfeed News, features Obama sharing a wish for his daughters to live as equals among men in their future. Meanwhile, Trump talks only about the  great body  of his teenage daughter Ivanka, while Howard Stern tells him he thinks she s hot.While Obama speaks about how much inspiration he takes from his wife Michelle and his two daughters, Trump is seen telling a female Apprentice contestant: Must be a pretty picture you dropping to your knees. When Obama speaks about his admiration for his mother, who raised him alone, and the struggles she faced in making ends meet and bringing up a son. At the other end of the spectrum, Trump tells a radio interviewer he has no plans to be involved in raising his next child   that s what his wife is for.The video features many more shockingly callous comments from Trump, who clearly has about as much respect for women and girls as he has for the truth. (Seriously, a recent study looking at more than 40 hours of campaign footage, found the Republican candidate lies on average, every five minutes.)https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/videos/1114564681897882/ Misogyny is not a joke. It is not some hobby horse that  angry women  ride around to piss men off. According to WHO figures, 1 in 3 women will experience sexual or physical abuse in her lifetime. It killed 18,000 American women in the last 12 years. This means that more women have been killed at the hands of their husbands and boyfriends since 9/11 than Americans died during 9/11 and in all terror attacks and wars since.This is a national (and global) crisis.As President, Barack Obama has done more for equal rights than many a President before him   but this is a project still in it s infancy. It would not survive the Presidency of Donald Trump. Should Mr Trump, or Mr Cruz for that matter, make it to the White House, it is likely that two generations of advances in women s rights will be unravelled. On reproductive rights, on equal pay, on prosecuting r*pe and s*xual assault, on s*xual harassment, on basic human respect   the Republican front runners are to the right of Ghengis Khan.These are views that should make the candidates unelectable in an advanced nation. It remains uncertain whether it makes them unelectable in America in 2016.But one thing is certain. If either makes it to the Oval Office, the US will be put into reverse gear on some of the most pivotal issues of our time   while the rest of the world drives forward.Featured image via YouTube screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

There s been plausible deniability for a while, but now the truth is revealed by someone who was there when it was engineered.Harper s ran a piece written by Dan Baum, who was writing in support of drug legalization, in which a very honest and completely damning quote was given by former Nixon policy advisor John Ehrlichman. The quote will give even the most ardent anti-drug naysayers pause when they realize that the whole  war on drugs  that they ve completely bought into is a total lie.The quote is below:At the time, I was writing a book about the politics of drug prohibition. I started to ask Ehrlichman a series of earnest, wonky questions that he impatiently waved away.  You want to know what this was really all about?  he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect.  The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I m saying? We knew we couldn t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did. I must have looked shocked. Ehrlichman just shrugged. Then he looked at his watch, handed me a signed copy of his steamy spy novel, The Company, and led me to the door.Source: JezebelThis false war has been carried on for decades by subsequent presidents, as a useful tool to continue suppressing anti-establishment segments of society. Just look at Ronald Reagan s crack  epidemic.  Former CIA officials have come forth to admit the drug was funneled into black neighborhoods as a form of social sabotage. It also provided an excuse for brutal over policing and mass incarceration of a majority of their young people for a growing profitable prison industrial complex.Baum also goes on to explain a huge reason why Republicans are so strongly against the legalization of marijuana, despite its obvious success:The citizens of the U.S. jurisdictions that legalized marijuana may have set in motion more machinery than most of them had imagined.  Without marijuana prohibition, the government can t sustain the drug war,  Ira Glasser, who ran the American Civil Liberties Union from 1978 to 2001, told me.  Without marijuana, the use of drugs is negligible, and you can t justify the law-enforcement and prison spending on the other drugs. Their use is vanishingly small. I always thought that if you could cut the marijuana head off the beast, the drug war couldn t be sustained. Source: JezebelWith the legalization of marijuana, a process has been started in America that would bring an end to a long-used secret Nixonian tool that was used for decades to attack liberal progressive and minority communities. This is exactly why Republicans are so strongly against it. It s time for this secret war on America by the right-wing to come to a permanent end.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

All of her  responsible  gun owning ways came to a head earlier this month when she left her freedom extension within reach of her small son and he picked it up, shooting while she was driving.On Tuesday, Putnam County Sheriff s Capt. Gator DeLoach announced that the department is recommending she be charged for her stupidity, but their recommendation will surely piss you off.  According to CBS News:Police say they are recommending a charge of allowing a child access to a firearm.Gilt could face up to 180 days in jail, reports CBS affiliate WJAX. The State Attorney s Office will ultimately make a decision on if charges will be filed.That s right, the police think that she should only be charged with a misdemeanor even though her actions put her son in mortal danger. CBS News also reported that the Florida Department of Children and Families have opened a case, but it looks as though she still has custody of her son. This is unbelievably outrageous.At the very least Gilt should have been charged with felony child neglect. According to Florida law, felony child neglect is defined as:A caregiver s failure or omission to provide a child with the care, supervision, and services necessary to maintain the child s physical and mental health, including, but not limited to, food, nutrition, clothing, shelter, supervision, medicine, and medical services that a prudent person would consider essential for the well-being of the child.This woman left a deadly weapon within reach of her four-year-old son. Not only was it within reach, but he handled the weapon and shot her. He could have very easily shot himself and died. Thankfully, though, her dumb ass was the only person injured. Now, if that isn t a  failure to provide supervision  I have no idea what is.This woman should never be allowed to own a gun again and she should not be allowed custody of her child until she takes some very intensive parenting classes. Her refusal to practice proper gun safety almost killed that little boy, and if she walks away from this with nothing but a misdemeanor charge we will have witnessed another great injustice in the state of Florida.Featured image via CBS""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Senator Sanders, who is Jewish and spent several months in Israel on Kibbutz when he was younger, gave a speech that differed significantly from any other presidential candidate s. Despite how different it was, media outlets gave very little attention to the speech given by Senator Sanders, while Hillary Clinton s speech garnered severe criticism from progressives and Palestinians who took offense to the imperialistic and military hawkish tone she took in line with the Republican candidates.

It would have increased on March 1st to $8.50 and then again to $10.10 a year later, but Republican Governor of Alabama Robert Bentley recently signed a bill banning cities from implementing any sort of minimum wage increases, while the state s minimum wage remains at the federal minimum of $7.25. Alabama remains one of the few states in the country without a state minimum wage law. Republicans used the same old argument in opposition of increasing the minimum wage, alleging it hurts businesses and the economy, when  in reality increasing minimum wage stimulates the economy by putting more money into the hands of the working class, especially in Alabama which has one of the highest poverty rates in the country.While Governor Bentley seems fixated on striking down any progressive reforms in his state, especially ones related to the national progressive movement to fight for a living wage of $15 an hour, it has been recently reported that the Governor gave his staff exorbitant raises in the past year.Four of his cabinet members received a raise of $73, 405 from their previous $91,000 salaries. Many of his other staff members received raises as well. Even many of his Republican colleagues felt obligated to vocalize their opposition to the raises. The Bentley administration says the state is broke,  Republican candidate for the Alabama State Board of Education, Jackie Zeigler, told the Alabama Political Reporter.  They have denied pay increases for teachers, State employees and retirees. They closed five State parks and cut back others. They closed 31 drivers license offices. They gutted the State Auditor s budget. They took 100 State troopers off the road. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, they were giving themselves huge pay raises. Cutting the normal people but adding to their own pay. This needs to stop. Just a few months ago, Governor Bentley took flack for using grant money from the BP Oil Spill meant to revamp affected beach communities on the Alabama coast to repair and renovate a second Governor s mansion, estimated to cost the state $1.8 million. With a Governor like this, Alabama, like most of the Republican strongholds in the south, are likely to remain hubs of poverty and growing wealth inequality.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

At a baseball game in Cuba, the president said: It s always a challenge when you have a terrorist attack anywhere in the world, particularly in this age of 24/7 news coverage. You want to be respectful and understand the gravity of the situation. But the whole premise of terrorism is to try to disrupt people s ordinary lives and one of my most powerful memories and one of my proudest moments as president was when I watched Boston respond after the marathon. Unlike the president, Ted Cruz s response was venomous and hateful and he had a sickening new plan, calling for Muslim neighborhoods to be under police watch. He said: We need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant al Qaida or ISIS presence. We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized. We need to secure the southern border to prevent terrorist infiltration. And we need to execute a coherent campaign to utterly destroy ISIS. Then of course there is the crazy Donald Trump. Instead of sending condolences and creating unity, here s what he had to say: I ve been talking about this for a long time. Brussels was a beautiful place. Zero crime, and now it s a disaster city. It s a total disaster and we have to be very careful  as to who we allow into this country. As usual, nothing but opportunistic Republican politicians looking to cash in on a tragedy. But the president s words resonated hope. He continued by saying: They cannot defeat America. They don t produce anything. They don t have a message that appeals to the vast majority of Muslims or the vast majority of people around the world. What they can do is scare and make people afraid and disrupt our daily lives and divide us and as long as we don t allow that to happen, we re gonna be okay. Cruz and Trump are clearly falling into the trap of what terror is designed to do.  Let s hope they don t succeed because if they do, that means that terror has succeeded.Watch Video Here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDdTiKLhCcc] Featured image via Wikimedia Commons.

Although his grandparents immigrated to the United States from Poland, Sanders lived in Israel for a short period of time after graduating from the University of Chicago.While a scheduling conflict kept Senator Sanders from being able to attend the conference, he did offer to speak to the lobbying group via teleconference, as many others have done in the past. His offer was refused.In spite of being shut out of the conference, Sanders spoke to a crowd in Utah, giving his own foreign policy speech regarding Israel.Sanders told the crowd, I was invited along with other presidential candidates to be at the AIPAC conference in Washington, but obviously I could not make it because we are here.The issues that AIPAC is dealing with are very important issues and I wanted to give the same speech here as I would have given if we were at that conference.Let me begin by saying that I think I am probably the only candidate for president who has personal ties with Israel.

It proves that Netanyahu and his cohorts were attempting to essentially bribe Republicans into sabotaging the diplomatic efforts of a sitting United States president.

What happens next is she ll meet with stations, make a pilot and sell it. Warm Springs first approached Palin with the idea in 2015 and has since put together a team that includes the TV executive who found Judge Judy and Judge Joe Brown.  Warm Springs Production had this to say regarding the project, which apparently has been in the works since last year: Palin s telegenic personality, wide appeal and common sense wisdom make her a natural for this kind of format and she was Warm Springs  top pick for this project.

Fox also complained about how they are hit with charges of Islamophobia whenever they cover ISIS and terrorist attacks.Here s the video via YouTube.But the problem is not that Fox is covering ISIS and terrorist attacks, it s that they usually always attack ALL Muslims as if the entire Muslim population is guilty of the attacks committed by a few religious extremists who do not represent the Muslim world, just like the KKK doesn t represent all Christians here in America.Being politically correct does not cause terrorist attacks. Hate and intolerance does and you won t hear Fox News talk about that at all. They d rather waste their time whining about how they can t be hateful and intolerant of Muslims without being called out for being the racists they are.It s important that we treat innocent Muslims with respect and dignity during this tragic time. Discriminating against them also makes things worse and gives ISIS new potential recruits to target.For a  news  outlet that constantly claims to be aligned with Christianity, Fox News sure does like war, hate, and bigotry when what we need right now is love and unity.Also, how much more despicable can Fox News get using yet another terrible deadly act of violence to push their own political agenda instead of simply reporting the news and showing sympathy to the dead?Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Ted Cruz is NOT the Republican Party s reasonable  alternative to Donald Trump, it s in his response to the Brussels terror attacks. Losing badly to Trump, Cruz is clearly feeling the pressure to capitalize on the tragedy to win some crucial votes   so he s gone all in on xenophobia, totalitarianism, and religious persecution. A hate cocktail sure to fire up his base.In a statement he released on Facebook, Cruz calls for the establishment of ghettos where America s Muslims can be contained and watched over by a specialized law enforcement group meant to police them. If that sounds a little to  Nazi-esque  for you, Cruz preemptively accused his critics of just being too  politically correct  to agree with him.Here s Cruz s terrifying vision for his presidency:We need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant al Qaida or ISIS presence.We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.We need to secure the southern border to prevent terrorist infiltration.And we need to execute a coherent campaign to utterly destroy ISIS.In other words, Cruz is plagiarizing Trump s  ban all Muslims  position, but adding that the Muslims already in the country should be  secured  in specific neighborhoods  before they become radicalized.  He doesn t bother clarifying how he would hope to accomplish this. Nor does he mention how he could legally target Muslims who had done nothing wrong just because his prejudice tells him they might some day.Being  Lying Ted  Cruz, he also couldn t help but spread a little misinformation about President Obama as well. Using the president s historic trip to Cuba as a strawman, Cruz bashed him for being on a diplomatic trip while Brussels was attacked, adding that Obama never visited Paris after the terror attacks there.

It s really beyond belief that you have one of the leading presidential candidates calling for law enforcement to target religious communities totally based on the fact that they are of a particular faith,  CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said by phone.  In normal times, this would be the sort of thing that would disqualify someone from running for dogcatcher, much less president of the United States. We call on voters to reject this.Undoubtedly, terrorism is a serious problem. But the solutions to it need to be much more mature than the Republicans seem to want to believe. Totalitarianism doesn t work   and never has. Discriminating against innocent Muslims because of a twisted death cult based in the Middle East is not only doomed to fail, but could backfire in ways that Cruz and Trump can t fathom from their  build a wall  childish ideology.Between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, it s hard to say who the bigger xenophobic bigot is. Both are consumed by a hatred towards scapegoated groups they hope to exploit in order to ensure people vote for them.

Bush   President Obama has worked to build a closer relationship with Israel while still pushing them publicly to stop the development of their  Jews only  settlements that have all but made a 2 state solution impossible. The progressives in the Democratic party have pushed for accountability with Israel due to its horrific human rights violations against the Palestinians, which rules over them and denies them the most basic of human rights in the West Bank and Gaza. Yet, despite the billions of dollars of tax payer money we give but can t afford to give to Israel, politicians are tripping over each other to grovel to the American Israel Public Affairs committee (AIPAC), the powerful pro-Israel lobby group that can make or break a political career.That s why all the political candidates lined up to speak at the AIPAC conference yesterday (minus the only Jewish candidate   Bernie Sanders) to see who can kiss Israel s a** the best; each of the Republican presidential candidates using Israel as a cudgel to hammer President Obama for not sufficiently bowing to the needs of the Israel first   AIPAC conference.It was quite embarrassing to watch American leaders grovel to a group whose sole reason for being is to push the interests of a foreign country. Out of all of the pandering and ass kissing that happened at AIPAC   there was one moment that brought a long ovation from the crowd. And this one moment really encapsulates the sense of entitlement for Israel.Trump s best line:  with President Obama in his final year, yay! And the crowd erupts. One would think there was a Rosh Hashanah celebration with the kind of applause heard in the crowd, but alas   it was a group of right wing Americans applauding President Obama being in his final year in office.Because from their vantage point   President Obama is secretly trying to destroy Israel. Despite the billions of dollars sent each year, the diplomatic cover the president has provided Israel at the United Nations for its war crimes and apartheid state   they hate him. Despite the years of partisanship by Prime Minister Netanyahu   where he inserted himself into the 2012 Presidential election to help Mitt Romney or the multiple years of public defiance over international agreements on the Iran peace deal having brokered a deal with the Republican party to speak to Congress behind President Obama s back   they blame him.AIPAC is upset because of the president s deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons and would rather see America s kids go to war on Israel s behalf than have the diplomatic solution the president was able to broker, which the great majority of US military leaders have called a good deal. They are also upset because the president has refused to raise Israel s welfare check to $5 billion a year from the current $3 billion we give them, despite the fact that we can t afford clean water in Flint, Michigan.One good word to to describe AIPAC s  reaction to Trump s condemnation of the president is: ungrateful.Watch video here: With Pres.

It represents an opportunity to strengthen relations between our two nations and a chance to change Cuba from within via American tourism and business opportunities.Thus far, the trip has been successful as Cuba has welcomed President Obama with open arms. But once news broke of the terrorist attacks in Brussels, conservatives immediately sounded off about how President Obama is in Cuba while Europe suffers yet another attack and further criticized Obama for not cutting his trip short to run back to the White House.Here are some of the tweets.Brussels under attack. Obama on a tourist trio in Havana with his family. Says it all.  Marc Thiessen (@marcthiessen) March 22, 2016 Terrible optics: ISIS attacks Brussels and Obama is with the Castro Brothers in Cuba.  Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) March 22, 2016Obama should leave Cuba and head back to the White House Situation Room immediately. #brusselsattack  Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) March 22, 2016The two bozos above are Fox News contributors so it really comes as no surprise that they would shamelessly use a terrorist attack to launch their own attack on President Obama.Even Ted Cruz got in on the Obama bashing, calling for the president to leave Cuba and come back to the states or go directly to Brussels.And do what exactly?President Obama has been planning this trip to Cuba for months, and it s not like leaving now will change anything. The truth is that there is very little President Obama can do beyond offering American condolences and offering assistance, which he has already done via phone call with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel.Furthermore, President Obama already receives constant briefings on the situation even though he s not at the White House. And as president, he can order any actions necessary from wherever he happens to be on the planet. In other words, he doesn t have to be in Washington or in Brussels to handle the attacks.In addition, this major terrorist attack did not occur in the United States. And if it had, it is likely President Obama would have hopped on Air Force One as soon as possible, but still would have the power to make the necessary communications with his staff while preparing for takeoff. In short, leaps in communication technology have made it possible for presidents to be in several places and deal with several situations at once from anywhere in the world.Let s not act like Brussels can t handle the situation. NATO is based there and Belgium has plenty of allies around them ready to help when asked. A visit from President Obama would just be a distraction because it would require security and police forces pay attention to keeping him safe instead of paying attention to the attack, the victims, and who perpetrated it.And the one really big reason why conservatives need to shut the hell up about President Obama not dropping everything to respond to a terrorist attack overseas is the fact that former President George W. Bush did the same thing in 2001, except the terrorist attack was the worst ever on American soil.That s right, even as New York City and Washington D.C. were under attack on September 11th, Bush kept his plan to read a story book to children at Emma T. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. Even after being told of the attacks in the middle of reading My Pet Goat, Bush continued to read instead of immediately jumping on board Air Force One to get to the Situation Room. And if there were ever a time to cancel plans and return to Washington, that was it. But Bush not only finished the book, he delivered a short scheduled speech and remained at the school for 30 minutes after being told about the attack the first time. And then he headed to the airport.But it left an image of a president who didn t seem to care about doing something as commander-in-chief to deal with the unfolding tragedy in our own country that would scar us and this nation for more than a decade and beyond.I don t recall conservatives whining about President Bush then, so they really shouldn t be whining about President Obama now.

As the world is still in shock and reeling from news of the terrorist bombings in Brussels Tuesday morning, the business mogul didn t hesitate to make truly despicable remarks about the attacks on Twitter, as well as insult President Barack Obama s historic trip to Havana, Cuba.In an interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, Trump used the terrorist attacks to imply that Obama s Cuba visit may correspond with setting up a little area in Cuba for the Muslim population.  Trump also said the bombings were a sure sign that if the United States doesn t secure its border, it is going to lead to just catastrophic problems.  The disgraced candidate actually had the nerve to say that a big part of the reason he has been  leading on the Republican side by a lot  was because of his racist, offensively strong position on building walls and controlling the border.Fox News was more than happy to follow Trump on his criticisms of Obama, with Bartiromo noting that it was  interesting  that the President would be speaking at a press conference during his last day in Cuba. She said: Isn t it interesting that now we understand that President Obama will give a live press conference later on today? He s probably going to discuss the terrorist attack from the brutal communist dictatorship of Cuba. So, what irony that is. Trump jumped in and asked, I wonder how many Muslims Cuba is taking in every year? I wonder if they re setting up a little area in Cuba for the Muslim population. Bartiromo moved right on through the interview, without even clarifying with Trump just why he would connect Muslim camps in Cuba to the President s visit. You can watch the video of Trump s disrespectful comments below:Now, the fact that Trump is making inflammatory remarks about Muslims is no surprise as he has been expressing anti-Islamic sentiments throughout his entire campaign. However, his remarks about Obama have different implications considering that Trump has become infamous for his claims that Obama was not born in America, and therefore should not be president. Trump started his own birther movement surrounding those claims, insisting that the President show his long-form birth certificate despite the overwhelming evidence that Obama was indeed an American citizen. Trump has also criticized Obama for making a speech at an American mosque, saying  Maybe he feels comfortable there. Just yesterday, Trump celebrated the fact that it was Obama s final year with a big  YAY!  while he spoke at the AIPAC conference. On the same day, Trump said Obama was the  worst thing to ever happen to Israel  during a town hall.

Sam Brownback. In one brutal sentence, Meyers summed up the disaster economics of the Republican party, pointing out that they  wrecked the Kansas economy so bad they had to auction off d*ldos for cash. Republican Gov Sam Brownback presided over the total collapse of the Kansas economy, the the point of bankruptcy. His ultraconservative agenda has seen rampant privatization of public assets, particularly in education, which helps with his further aim of stripping back scientific and secular classes in favor of religious schooling. The results were outlined by Meyer in a truly stinging, and hilarious, rebuke of Republican-style economics. In the last few years, Kansas has become somewhat of a laboratory for Conservative Gov. Sam Brownback who cut taxes for the wealthy and completely eliminated income taxes for small businesses. A plan he boldly described this way,  showing a clip of Gov. Brownback selling his authoritarian right wing budget plans as a  real live experiment . Real-live experiment  is a terrible sales pitch for something,  says Meyers Those words usually only show up in shady classified ads. Nevertheless, Brownback got his plans through and Kansas was submitted to the kind of terrifying economic experiment that Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys put Latin Americans nations like Chile through in the 1970s.The results were nothing short of a disaster for the state, which lost $688 million in just a single year, and had its economy downgraded by the S&P. Things became so desperate, that one attempt to raise critically-needed revenues saw the state auction p*rnography and s*x toys from a business owing back taxes, after seizing their property. In closing, Meyers grins: And now, here are the jokes we made to make fun of the Kansas d*ldo auction: Nothing like selling fake d*cks to solve a problem created by a real one. Selling the d*ldos didn t solve the whole problem. Just the tip. It s hard to sell d*ldos to people who are already f*cked. And the worst one: D*ldo, I don t think we re in Kansas anymore.

However, that is just who showed up to the 2016 edition of CPAC.David Silverman is with what is arguably the largest and most vocal secular group in America   American Atheists. He also ran a booth at CPAC. As you can imagine, this was not a well-received endeavor. However, being one of the most outspoken atheists in America has its advantages, and Full Frontal host Samantha Bee broadcast Silverman s trolling of righteous Christians at CPAC on her show, Full Frontal. What happened can only be described as brilliant comedy gold.Silverman s booth and display included signs with messages such as  keep your theocracy out of my democracy.  Silverman also broadcast his contempt for religion, saying: Religion is a lie. A scam. A con. It has no redeeming values and it has no place in today s society. There were also undeniable statistical facts in the clip that gave the message that refuted the idea that there are no atheists, especially since the number of non religious Americans is at 56,000,000 and growing. It warned believers: Stop saying,  Hey, atheists! Go away! The thing is, we atheists aren t going anywhere; in fact the opposite is true. We are the fastest growing  religious  group   especially among young people, including conservatives. This was evidenced by the fact that young conservatives began approaching Silverman s booth and listening to what he had to say. Silverman even referenced GOP frontrunner Donald Trump as a reason young conservatives are turning away from religion, saying through another animation: The conservative coalition, with its disparate components, has always been a platypus, stitched together with other platypi to create a platy-franken-pus. Now it s rotting at the seams collapsing into a festering pile of platy, frank and pus, feasted on by orange maggots. This oozing and tropic goo might present a nourishing culture medium for the atheists at CPAC, but many were unhappy to see them. The thing is, Silverman is right. Religion in general is quickly dying, especially the extreme conservative variety. The fact that a huge secular presence was at them most conservative event held each year is most ominous indeed for that movement, and great for ours.

But once again, the people of Arizona got the law struck down in court which has caused Republicans to hold a grudge against the peasants ever since.So when Tempe, Arizona made an effort to pass a mandatory paid sick leave law, Arizona Republicans in the state legislature reacted immediately to make sure big corporations don t have to pay a cent to help the workers who work so hard to make the company rich.Bloomberg reports:Arizona s House passed a bill on March 1 specifying that cities aren t allowed to require private employers to provide paid sick leave or vacation. The state Senate has passed companion legislation that would cut state funds, used to pay for services like police and firefighting, for cities that try to supersede state laws.Arizona Republicans are literally threatening cities across the state with critical budget cuts that fund critical services if they dare lift a finger to help workers. Governor Doug Ducey also supports the legislation so it could very well become law.And if you aren t quite pissed off enough yet, just wait till you read what Arizona GOP Senator Andy Biggs had to say about his party s effort to make workers feel like slaves.According to Biggs, cities  think that they re an independent and sovereign entity from the state, which is not true they re a creature of the state. You can t put a municipality in jail, nor would we. What we re really seeking to do is provide a deterrent effect. Yeah, the kind of deterrent that says Republicans are flaming hypocrites when it comes to saying they support small government. Instead of cheering on local governments for making decisions themselves, Arizona Republicans have declared that the state is a mini-tyranny where only the state gets to make the rules and good luck getting any money for your city or town to protect yourself against bands of thieves, killers, and fires if you rebel against King John in an effort to help the working poor.Seriously, where s Robin Hood when you need him?Featured image via Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

According to Karen Attiah, deputy digital editor for the Washington Post, Trump told her she was  beautiful  as she asked him a detailed question about his policies on racial inclusion. The incident happened as Trump met with the editorial board of the Washington Post on Monday.So. I got hit on today by Donald Trump.  Karen Attiah (@KarenAttiah) March 21, 2016As the meeting ended and we were walking out of the room, I thanked Trump for taking my question. He turned to me and said,  I really hope I answered your question,  and added casually with a smile,  Beautiful.  I was stunned. I didn t say thank you, and I don t think I smiled. He then walked out to meet with my Post colleagues briefly before heading to the elevator.I stayed in the conference room for a few minutes as it sunk in that the potential GOP nominee for president thought it was okay to comment on my appearance. Did he just say that?The moment made Attiah think about how Trump views the world, noting that, In Trump s world, commenting on a woman s appearance in a professional setting is fair game. She added:At least now I know, firsthand, that the sexism that Trump puts on display against Megyn Kelly under the lights of national TV is not that much different from how he is in real life toward female journalists.Trump has a history of bizarre behavior and language directed towards women.Appearing on the Howard Stern radio show, Trump discussed Latina actress Eva Longoria, telling Stern: She s really cute, I have to tell you, she s really bouncy, really cute. She s about five foot one. Do you like girls that are five foot one? They come up to you know where. He added: You have to get started, you have to like short girls. She s very, very short. You know, she goes out with a basketball player, which is interesting but she s very short. In other clips from his appearances on Stern, Trump could be heard ranking, rating and degrading various women. For instance:In one instance, Trump ranked his top 10 most beautiful women, and while his then-girlfriend Melania Knauss took the top spot, Trump told Stern he definitely would have sex with Mariah Carey, Cindy Crawford, and Princess Diana, who also made the list. In another appearance, Trump assigned each of the actors on ABC s Desperate Housewives a score of 1 to 10 based on their attractiveness. He said of one of the actors, Nicollette Sheridan:  A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10.  When he got to Marcia Cross, he asked Stern,  Would you go out with Marcia Cross or would you turn gay, Howard? Trump has a problem with women, particularly assertive women in a position of authority. This incident just appears to be more evidence of that.Featured image via Twitter/Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They seem to think that this is some kind of issue that is going to destroy their state with rampant crime. Oklahoma and Nebraska got so worked up over it, that they tried to force the SCOTUS to shut down Colorado s legal weed industry.The Republican argument is that it s causing crime to  come across state borders.  As a result, they petitioned the SCOTUS to force Colorado to shut down their legalized weed industry citing that marijuana is still illegal under federal law.To call this court case a  layer cake of profound Republican hypocrisy,  would be understating it. Let s run down a couple important points.Republicans are arguing that the supremacy clause of the Constitution means that federal law completely overrules state law, in regards to marijuana legalization. These are the same Republicans who HATE the federal government and insist that federal laws on things like guns should simply be ignored or  nullified  as the confederates like to say. They insist that state s rights are a thing, even in the face of their beloved supremacy clause.Republicans are A-Okay with things like guns flowing from states with weak gun laws into states with higher gun regulation. They do not care about the crime, terror, violence and death these cause because the NRA told them they are not allowed to care. That joint you brought home in your pocket, though, is an outright declaration of war by Colorado apparently.The SCOTUS rejected the case, saying that the states did not try to pursue the avenues available to them in lower courts first. The Department Of Justice said,  Entertaining the type of dispute at issue here   essentially that one state s laws make it more likely that third parties will violate federal and state law in another state   would represent a substantial and unwarranted expansion of this court s original jurisdiction. The likelihood of this case meeting any success on behalf of red states is low at best. The precedent set by some states being allowed to sue to rewrite the laws in other states would be a disaster for the courts, not to mention for Republicans  corporate overlords. The NRA would be in a gasping panic over a state like Illinois or Connecticut suing Virginia over its lax gun laws causing otherwise banned firearms to cross state lines.Featured image via wikicommons""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

While taking questions from the audience at the construction site of the Trump International Hotel, the candidate decided to stop the show and give a woman a job interview on the spot while cameras were rolling and everyone else awkwardly looked on.The woman identified herself as a 9/11 survivor and an Iraq and Afghanistan War veteran, telling Trump: I love the policy that you have for the military. I wanted to know if Trump towers would be part of the veterans job  Trump cut the woman off and said, What are you talking about here? We are doing some of that actually already. We have it very much involved. Why what are you looking for? What kind of a position? Then Trump invited her to  come up here  on stage with him.As the woman joined him, Trump asked the crowd gathered at his soon-to-be hotel,  Do you mind if I do a job interview right now? We need good people. For this  job interview , Trump instructed the woman to tell everyone about about her experience with design and decorating. In those few seconds, Trump decided that she would be a great employee and passed her off to  the men  in charge of the building, saying that if they could negotiate a great deal on her salary, she would probably have a job in no time.You can watch this strange, impromptu interview below:WATCH: Donald Trump conducts impromptu job interview during press conference.https://t.co/KNb43kll8c  CSPAN (@cspan) March 21, 2016The interview was so weird and uncomfortable to watch, Trump got grilled by the next reporter he chose to take questions from.

I gave my driver s license to a poll worker, HW,  Ravindra wrote. He kept it face down and ordered me to spell my name. Although I go by Rudy, my legal name is Rudravajhala. In order to save time, I requested HW look at my ID. He barked,  You gotta spell it!  So I took a deep breath and began.  R-U-D-  He repeated after me and typed each letter. When he typed a B instead of a D, I had to correct him,  It s not B; it s D for dog. This farce went on a for a while, and each time he made a mistake, I patiently corrected. Meanwhile, voters in adjacent lines came and went briskly. I heaved a sigh of relief when HW finally entered my mouthful of a name into his computer and peered at the monitor. And then I had to pronounce it, and when he tried, he couldn t get it right.He asked,  Your address? After repeating his address to the poll worker, Ravindra was declared  the perfect voter  and allowed to cast his ballot.Poll workers are not allowed to test voters, but this poll worker in North Carolina seemed to think that his state had returned to the days of Jim Crow and that he was entitled to demand Ravindra jump through illegal hoops to exercise his right to vote.When Ravindra brought his wife to cast her ballot later on, a different poll worker conducted the exact same test even though white voters were able to come and go as they pleased without having to deal with such harassment. Our two Caucasian friends who live in different areas of town voted at different polling places,  Ravindra reported.  In contrast to our humiliating experience, however, they did not have to pass the spelling test and after a cursory glance at their IDs were allowed to vote. With that knowledge, Ravidra and his wife felt discriminated against, especially since the rise of Donald Trump has caused overwhelming suspicion and hatred of people with foreign-sounding names. My wife and I couldn t help but feel that we were singled out. The poll workers could have simply looked at our IDs and saved a lot of time. That in a sea of white faces at both polling stations my wife and I were the only brown-skinned individuals also led us to suspect that we were victims of racial prejudice. In these days of Trumpism and shameless xenophobia and other assorted phobias, we can t be blamed if we are paranoid. Ravindra contacted the State Board of Elections whose director apologized for what the couple went through and confirmed that poll workers are only supposed to look at the ID. They are NOT supposed to force people of color to pass spelling tests in order to vote. In the final analysis,  Ravindra concluded,  this is a bad law and subject to over-interpretation by overzealous, and possibly rogue, officials. Clearly, Jim Crow is still alive and well in some red states and the has to be particularly embarrassing to North Carolina citizens who not too long ago lived in a thriving blue state on the cusp of achieving true progress far from its days as a slave state in the Confederacy.Featured Image: Think Progress""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Sanders is particularly popular with young people who see him as a desperately needed agent of change who can turn the system around and ensure a better future for all Americans.And it s because college students support him that one Christian televangelist is calling Sanders the next Adolf Hitler. You know, the Nazi Germany dictator who ordered the extermination of six million Jews during World War II. Yeah, that Hitler.During a sermon, disgraced pastor Jim Bakker openly compared Sanders to Hitler citing his socialist beliefs and claimed that if he s elected every American will be dead in a year. One of the most popular politicians right now is a socialist   And who is his biggest following? The young people of America, from the colleges. Maybe you understand a little bit what it felt like to live when Hitler was reigning and the church had to sit by and keep watching it and watching until millions, tens of millions   they had to build factories to kill people. All it takes is a couple bombs and all of America will be dead within a year, less than a year, just months. Bakkers audience, of course, consisted of a bunch of easily frightened old conservative white people.Here s the video via YouTube.There are many problems with Bakker s comparison.First of all, while young people are flocking to Sander s campaign, they are doing so on their own volition while Hitler and the Nazi Party actually went into schools to indoctrinate the German youth to get their support.Second, Bernie Sanders is a Democratic Socialist, which is totally different from a National Socialist.As Sanders explained in November, Democratic Socialism  builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans. And it builds on what Martin Luther King, Jr. said in 1968 when he stated that,  This country has socialism for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor.  It builds on the success of many other countries around the world that have done a far better job than we have in protecting the needs of their working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. Indeed, Sanders believes in  economic equality, universal health care, Wall Street reform, universal college education, paid family leave. In addition, Sanders also seeks  political reforms to limit the power of the wealthy so there is  democratic socialism for working families, not just Wall Street, billionaires and large corporations National Socialism, on the other hand, is a brutal and authoritarian fascist ideology practiced by the Nazis and other right-wing groups who believe in a racial hierarchy with whites at the top. Nazis support policies that push national power, demonize intellectualism, subjugate women, punish homosexuality, censor the free press, and are over-obsessed with Christianity among multiple other aspects you can find by clicking here.In NO way does National Socialism apply to Bernie Sanders. Jim Bakker would be thinking of THIS guy:Image via ImgurNeed proof of Trump s fascism? Well, there s the fact that he ll soon have his own version of Hitler s Brownshirts. Then there s the fact that legendary investigative journalist Carl Bernstein explained why Trump is a fascist. There s this excellent comparison made by the Daily Show. And there s the fact that neo-Nazis show up to support Trump at his rallies.Seriously, Jim Bakker is either oblivious to the real fascism being pushed by Trump or he supports Trump and just wants to shift the accusations of fascism to Sanders to protect the Republican front-runner. Either way, Bakker and his church should face steep taxes for engaging in political speech, especially the kind that pushes outright lies.Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It s absolute nonsense, and better plans have been constructed on the back of a napkin at Chuck-E-Cheese by a desperate father brainstorming his escape from the chaos.However, knowing that this  great wall  is pretty much one of the few things Trump talks about, Oliver said: The border wall is one of the few policy proposals Trump has talked about in detail, so instead of mocking or dismissing it out of hand, tonight let s take a serious proposal by a serious presidential candidate seriously. It was then that the dismantling began, and there was absolutely no refuting it. And no matter how much the wall costs, Oliver points out that according to the Sierra Club,  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that wall maintenance costs will exceed the initial construction costs within seven years  He then used this brilliant comparison: It s a big, dumb thing that only gets more expensive over time. It s like getting a pet walrus: You think it s stupid now, wait until you learn what a bucket of sea cucumbers costs. You ve not prepared for that!

If you look at what s happened since, there are a lot of questions in many of the Republicans  minds on whether he would be wrong on just about every issue that Republicans think are important,  Hatch said.  From abortion to gun rights to the Second Amendment to all kinds of other union and anti-union type things. Hatch then claimed that Democrats would do the same thing if the roles were reversed and then returned to using the election as an excuse to not do his job. If the roles were reversed and we had a Republican president and a Democrat [sic] control of the Judiciary Committee, I guarantee they would never let a vote. This is one of the most horrific campaigns I ve seen. You would put this right in the middle of that? It would be a terrifically sad thing, and I think it would demean the court. Of course, the roles have been reversed before. In 1987, Ronald Reagan nominated right-wing extremist Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. Democrats strenuously objected to Bork s views on women s rights and civil rights but despite controlling the Senate, Democrats still held hearings on Bork s nomination and even held a confirmation vote, which Bork lost.But the point is that when Democrats were in the same role Republicans are in now they chose to do their jobs and did not outright refuse to hold hearings on Reagan s nominee. Reagan would go on to pick moderate Anthony Kennedy as the nominee and he sailed through the Senate and has been a fixture on the high court ever since.What Republicans are doing now, however, is completely different. President Obama did not pick a staunch liberal as his nomineee. He picked a moderate like Reagan eventually did. But Republicans are refusing to even hold hearings because what they want is a conservative nominee. And Hatch admitted as much. You can t just put politics aside,  Hatch said.  In every respect, this is probably the most important pick in many decades. If they succeed in taking over the Supreme Court, they ll have control over for probably 30 years. Hatch literally just admitted that Senate Republicans are refusing to their jobs because they are holding out for a conservative nominee, which means this blatant obstruction could last for more than year, especially if a Democrat wins the presidency in November.Here s the video via KSTU.Looks like the only way to make the Senate do their job is to give it back to Democrats. Because if we don t, Republicans will keep the Supreme Court at eight Justices for as long as possible, and that just won t work in the long term as tie cases are not settled cases and will just add a greater workload to an already stressed judicial branch.

Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) March 21, 2016Warren s tweets all hit at what are considered soft spots for Trump. He has boasted about his huge wealth, but numerous reports indicate that his net worth is considerably exaggerated. From Trump biographer Timothy O Brien:On a single day in August 2004, he told me his net worth was $4 billion to $5 billion, then revised that later the same day to $1.7 billion. Forbes said at the time he was worth $2.6 billion. A year later Donald told me he was worth $5 billion to $6 billion, but a brochure left on my nightstand at his Palm Beach resort said he was worth $9.5 billion.The tweets also discuss Trump s sexism, which appears to be one of his major Achilles  heels. When Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly pointed out his history of demeaning women, he complained she was bleeding out of her  whatever,  and still months later has referred to her as  crazy,  which drew an uncharacteristic rebuke of a Republican from the right-wing propaganda network.Perhaps most importantly, Warren is indicating to the mainstream media and other Democrats that Trump s racially motivated campaign won t be off limits to criticism. So far, Republicans have largely avoided hitting Trump on his offensive language towards latinos and Muslims, as well as towards black activists (he called for protesters to be punched). The Democrats largely have no interest in courting the racists that dwell in the base of the GOP, and have no such restrictions on what they can say in the general election.It looks like the fight is truly on.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

So, of course he formally endorsed Donald Trump and has been cited as a possible VP choice for the likely Republican presidential nominee. Rather than let Trump take all the glory in racist provocations, insane proposals, and a supporter base which represents the worst things about this country, Governor Rick Scott matches Trump in how low a public official can really go, and may offer a glimpse into what lies in the future for this country if Donald Trump is elected president.The giant, for-profit, hospital chain, Tenet Healthcare, was investigated by journalists in July 2015 amid claims the hospitals were failing miserably in living up to the state of Florida s quality standards for children s heart surgery. A CNN investigation found the mortality rate for these surgeries was more than three times the national average.Instead of improving the quality of care in their hospitals, Tenet Healthcare responded with a $200,000 donation to Florida Republicans, and in kind, Governor Rick Scott got rid of the standards, allowing Tenet Healthcare to continue making thousands of dollars from performing these surgeries while endangering the lives of thousands of children born with heart defects. Of course, Governor Scott and Tenet denied having conversations with one another, despite the coincidence that Governor Scott decided a couple months after the investigation to repeal the standards when he had since the time he took office in 2011 to do so.Florida s Department of Health excused the repeal due to the legislature not having the authority to have enacted them in the first place, regardless the standards have been in place for an uncontested 32 years. Parents and cardiac pediatricians took the state of Florida to court over the state s repealing of the standards, but the Florida judge ruled in favor of the state. The same judge ruled in 2014, a doctor accused of handcuffing and beating a patient over the course of a yearlong sexual relationship can continue to practice medicine. I can t think of anywhere else in the country where you have safety standards and someone doesn t like them, so you just have it repealed,  Dr. Peter Pronovost, senior vice president for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine, told CNN in an interview this past January. These standards have been in use for more than 30 years, and they re widely acknowledged to ensure safety   why would you repeal them? If the state really felt it didn t have the legislative authority to have the standards, why wouldn t they go out and get that authority? This is exactly the kind of corruption we don t need in government, and in the worst possible industry.

If so, Ted Cruz can kiss his political career and quite possibly his marriage goodbye.

You have to look at what has happened,  Reid said.  We have never held up a Supreme Court nomination. Since 1900 in a lame-duck session, there have been six that have all been approved. Here s the video via NBC:Republicans are probably crying foul at this point, but Politifact took up the case and investigated Reid s claims, and conservatives are definitely not going to like the results.As it turns out, Politifact rated Reid s claim as  Mostly True.  Despite Republican claims that Democrats started some kind of precedent for their own actions in the present day, the fact-checking organization found that only Republicans have ever not held hearings for a Supreme Court nominee.Politifact pointed out that when President Bush nominated Harriet Miers to a fill a vacancy on the high court both Democrats and Republicans objected, therefore, Democrats are not solely responsible for denying a nominee a full hearing. Miers also at least was allowed to meet with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which under Republican control is flatly denying current nominee Merrick Garland a meeting of any kind.Then Politifact moved on to the 1987 nomination of extreme conservative Robert Bork, which was highly contentious. Democrats did, indeed, launch much public opposition against him, but in the end, even Bork received a full hearing and lost.The nomination of Samuel Alito in 2005 drew filibuster attempts by Democrats, including Reid and then-Senator Obama, but as Reid pointed out to Chuck Todd, Alito is sitting on the Supreme Court bench now because Democrats dropped their filibuster effort and he was confirmed.Despite the latter two contentious nomination battles, Politifact ruled that they  can t find a time when a Democratic Senate refused to hear a Republican president s nominee. Even if they were opposed, they allowed the nominee to come to a confirmation vote. In short, only Republicans have refused to even hold hearings for a Supreme Court nominee and it s not because of some non-existent tradition started by Democrats or some non-existent precedent that goes back 80 years regarding election year nominations. It s because Republicans are throwing a temper tantrum because they don t want the black president to extend his legacy through the Supreme Court. That and they think only a conservative is entitled to replace Scalia.The bottom line, however, is that Senate Republicans need to suck it up and do their jobs because the American people and the Constitution demand it.Featured image: Cagle""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

So, of course, when being interviewed, Pierson and other workers on the Trump campaign are asked to denounce this behavior. Of course, they never do, though. On Sunday, Pierson appeared on Fox and was asked about the escalating violence at Trump rallies. Host Jeannine Pirro wondered aloud if the entire Trump show   the violence the protests, all of it   were anarchy, or perhaps some kind of game to get a specific candidate nominated. Pierson s response was predictably stupid: I think a lot of it is anarchy, but I think more importantly this is organized chaos. They are trying to create a public perception of violence to scare people [away from] supporting Mr. Trump. She then went on to make the ridiculous assertion that conservative values have been absent in the community  since the days of GOP favorite Ronald Reagan, and ever since it has been a free for all for the militant left in this political [sic] correct society where it s okay for them to use violence as an intimidation tactic or just yell  racist  or  Hitler  to smear someone s character.

Pierson chose to ignore this and say: You have people like MoveOn.org and Black Lives Matter and some of these anarchy groups, that s all they do is look for fights.

Pierson went on to give the ominous warning that Trump s supporters would only be emboldened by those who try to plot to stop him from getting the GOP 2016 nomination, saying: This is the American people having a head-on collision with the truth, which is that the Democratic side is not on the side of the people, and the militant left is their army.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""In February, video surfaced of evangelical pastors leading students in prayer in Hollister, Missouri during lunchtime in the school cafeteria.As it turns out, school officials actually allow this a few times a week, and the Christian group that proselytizes to the students is the only religious group that has been allowed to interact with students on public ground that is supposed to be secular.The religious group, known as KLIFE, has been going around indoctrinating students at several schools for a few years now. And because Hollister students have been conducting prayers in the lunchroom, KLIFE senior pastor Robert Bruce visited the school and took part in the prayers, which weren t exactly silent and could be heard throughout the room even by students who do not subscribe to the Christian religion. Since then, Bruce and his organization have been preaching to all the students at lunchtime and have forced prayer upon them as if it s a requirement to eat.Here s a video of one of the prayer sessions via YouTube.Soon, the Freedom From Religion Foundation got involved, advising the school to end the practice of allowing a single religious group to have such open access to the student body and reminding them of the law. It is well settled as a matter of established law that public schools may not advance, prefer or promote religion,  FFRF said in a statement. It is unconstitutional for a public school to allow an evangelical Christian organization to impose prayer on all students. Giving the group access to all students as part of school programming suggests that the school district has preference not only for religion over nonreligion, but also evangelical Christianity over other faiths. This sort of entanglement between religion and public education is inappropriate. The FFRF is correct. While the Supreme Court can t stop students from praying silently together or individually, it has ruled that schools cannot promote one religious belief over anotherBut so far, Superintendent Brain Wilson has resisted that advice because he claims any community leader can visit students during lunch. It kind of makes one wonder how he and parents would react if Satanic Temple leaders came knocking on the school door. Because you know they would not like that one bit.It s also pretty clear that KLIFE s goal is to indoctrinate kids into Christianity at a young age, because as Branson Junior High Principal Bryan Bronn said in 2014, Somebody once told me that if you wanted to reach students and you wanted to be serious about being, as Jesus called us to be, fishers of men, then you need to be serious about where the fish are at. And we all know that fish travel in  schools. In other words, treat students like fish in a barrel where they can t escape and you ll likely brainwash many to follow you. That s apparently the case in Hollister and other area schools, which means non-religious students in these schools must feel pretty damn intimidated.And Bristol Palin totally approves of that.On her little blog earlier this week, the daughter of America s village idiot wrote about how proud she is that Christian students in Hollister are forcing their religious beliefs on atheists.As parents, we pray our children will take our faith and it make it their own. We instill in them the building blocks of a relationship with Jesus, and hope they will have the boldness to carry it through their lives. A few children in Hollister, Missouri recently made their parents very proud.As per usual, Palin goes on to whine about how the FFRF is involved and even brought out the tired conservative line that the Constitution says Freedom of Religion and not Freedom from Religion. And then she wrote this:To the students in Hollister: you are what our country needs! Continue your hard work, stand strong together, and don t allow yourselves to become discouraged. You are fighting a hard battle, but one that has value beyond measure.In short, Bristol Palin wants those students to stand up against those evil atheists and jam Christianity down their throats whether they like it or not.But that would be a complete violation of those students  First Amendment rights. And by allowing an evangelical group to have so much power over students, the school is basically sponsoring a specific religion. The school is also failing the Lemon test set by the Supreme Court in 1971 which says any school-sponsored practice must be secular, neither advance nor inhibit religion, and can t result in an excessive entanglement between government and religion.Well, this certainly isn t secular since it s just one religious group participating. It s clearly only advancing religion while inhibiting the beliefs and non-beliefs of other students, and it s a public school financed by tax dollars and overseen by the state government of Missouri, which means it s mixing government and religion. The school could claim the prayer isn t being disruptive but that isn t true either since this story has drawn attention from the national and local media and is setting up future lawsuits.No one is saying that students can t be Christians. But there is a place for Christians to go practice their religion and that place is generally known as a church and I hear it is open on Sunday or just about any day of the week.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Florida senator and former presidential candidate Marco Rubio was upset after Obama had announced the visit.

The creepy Cruz also disagreed to the visit. He said: He has alienated and abandoned our friends and allies. You know, one of the first things he did when he became president was send the bust of Winston Churchill back to the United Kingdom. That was shameful.

In response, Beck yelled to the audience and put his hand on the boy s forehead while crying, saying,  This is the priesthood rising! This isn t something completely new.

And they most certainly don t care about women s freedom to affordable and accessible reproductive health care. This has become more clear than ever especially in Florida, and because it s Florida it s become a circus of the absurd.In a recently passed bill that will be signed by Gov. Rick Scott (R) it basically strips all funding from Planned Parenthood, because really, why should women have access to affordable care? However, Republicans tout the same old fictitious line that Planned Parenthood is just an abortion clinic, so it doesn t deserve to be funded. Let s be clear, though, even if it were only an abortion clinic, it still deserves funding because abortion is legal and it a women s right to make her own medical decisions.Here s the most obscene part of the whole bill, though   you know, besides stripping freedom away from hundreds of thousands of female Floridians   the list of  alternative  clinics for women to receive reproductive health.According to the Tampa Bay Times, anti-choice advocates  want that money to be spent in other kinds of clinics, like crisis pregnancy centers and federally qualified health centers. What are those other  federally qualified health centers? Well, according to The Guardian,  several state lawmakers who have insisted that plentiful alternatives exist for reproductive and sexual healthcare have cited a list of health centers that includes dentists, optometrists, and elementary schools. When the co-sponsor of the bill, Colleen Burton, was asked about these  alternative resources alternative resources for birth control, pap smears, breast exams and other reproductive services.  She answered: We have 52 federally qualified health centers, the counties have health departments, physicians  offices, independent clinics would be eligible if they applied and met the requirements. Fellow state lawmaker Lori Berman pressed further, saying: I have seen the list of the groups. And some of those groups include podiatrists, correctional facilities, healthcare, school-based healthcare clinics. Proponents of the bill insist there are ample number of alternatives where women can go to receive the care that they need, but that s a false narrative considering most of the places are in no way capable of providing women s health services.It s absolutely reprehensible that Republicans are playing politics with women s lives like this. All because they know defunding Planned Parenthood plays to their base of idiotic voters who don t even know what it is, and rely on the lies being spread by right-wing media.We need to stop allowing women s lives to be controlled by politicians, and ironically the same politicians who come from a party that boasts it s chef-d oeuvre is perpetuating freedom to all, which clearly is a lie.Planned Parenthood is an integral part of community health and family planning.

The fact is, however, that current Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed to the high court in 1988, which was an election year. If we go back even further, we find that Justice William Brennan was confirmed in 1956 and Justice Frank Murphy was confirmed in 1940, both during election years.So it s clear an election year does not justify the refusal of Senate Republicans to do their constitutional duty.But Chris Wallace hit McConnell with his own words from 2005 when he said on the Senate floor that  in a democracy an up or down vote should be given to a president s judicial nominees. It isn t complicated. It s simple. It s fair. It worked for 229 years and it has served us well. Frankly, isn t there a fair amount of hypocrisy on both sides here?  Wallace said, calling out McConnell s own hypocrisy on this issue. Senator, if an up or down vote for a judicial nominee is simple, fair, and a principle that has served us well for over 230 years; if that s true then, is it still true?  Wallace asked.McConnell, of course, tried to weasel his way out of it by saying that  it s apples and oranges  because Supreme Court nominees are somehow not considered judicial nominees even though the Constitution includes the Supreme Court as part of the judicial branch. It s right there in Article III.When asked if Senate Republicans would confirm Garland after the election to prevent a more liberal nominee should Hillary Clinton become president, McConnell proceeded to trash current nominee Merrick Garland as a liberal and complained that his confirmation would swing the court to the left. And if McConnell and his fellow Republicans are unwilling to confirm Garland, you can bet that if the GOP loses the election, they will continue to obstruct any nominee that Clinton nominates to the Suprem Court as well.Here s the video via YouTube.Basically, McConnell just admitted that the real problem Republicans have with confirming a Supreme Court nominee is that they don t want to lose the conservative-leaning Court they have used to roll back policies they don t like over the last couple decades. They are literally throwing a temper tantrum because they think late-Justice Scalia should be replaced with a conservative judge who will be just like him.But that is not how the Supreme Court works. It has always swung from left to right and back again depending on who the president is at the time a vacancy arises either from a death, which is the case now, or a retirement. Justice Scalia probably would have preferred to serve another decade or more on the bench, but even he would say that his vacancy needs to be filled even if the most liberal nominee in the world ends up filling it.As it happens, Garland is not a liberal. He is, in fact, a centrist. But according to McConnell, even that is far too liberal for him and his colleagues to consider.Republicans are literally willing to keep the Supreme Court from working at full capacity for the next year or more until they get their way. So not only have Republicans kept Congress from working properly, they are now preventing the high court from working properly as well and that should outrage every American to the core enough to boot Republicans out of public office for generations until they learn to do their jobs with honor again and start working for all of the American people instead of just their extreme right-wing base.

Although the state of Georgia does not have a hate crimes statute, federal hate crimes charges could still be applied in the case.On March 17, Tolbert spoke with WSB-TV about the attack.Watch the interview below. According to the latest FBI statistics,  7,242 people were the victims of a hate crime in 2013. More than 20 percent of all victims of hate crimes included in the FBI report were targeted because of their sexual orientation.But most advocates believe that hate-based attacks against members of the LGBT community are severely underreported. The facts support this conclusion.As Vocativ reports here, a large number of hate crimes committed against LGBT citizens are never identified or reported as hate crimes.Gregory Herek, a psychology professor at the University of California at Davis who specializes in violence against sexual minorities, explained to Vocativ: The best estimates suggest that the real number of hate crimes are up to 40 times larger than the numbers contained in the FBI reports. For a hate crime to be recorded in the national statistics, it first must be reported by the victim to the police,  Herek said.Most often, this doesn t happen: In fact, the National Crime Victimization Survey found that more than half of hate crimes are never reported. That s only the beginning of the battle.  Then it must be classified by the local law enforcement agency as a hate crime,  he says.  This often isn t done unless the agency has special training for officers and personnel who are assigned to respond to hate crimes. What happened to these two young men is horrific. Yet what can we expect from a society which allows Christian extremists to openly call for the execution of LGBT citizens? What can we expect from a society that grants right wing pastors tax-exempt status to spread homophobic hatred through their churches, or a society that allows republican legislators to spend billions of taxpayer dollars to further an agenda of anti-gay hate? If we want to stop the violence we have to stop the extremists who instigate it, shutting them down in our communities, our churches and especially in our government.Featured image via Vickie Gray via Huffington Post ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

On the other hand, when it comes to Donald Trump, the major networks have given the Republican candidate who wants to make America hate again total domination of America s television screens.This bias was recently exemplified when the big three news networks all decided not show Bernie Sanders  concession speech on Super Tuesday 3. Goodman points this out, saying: Let s look at Super Tuesday 3, you had major coverage here at CNN, at MSNBC, at Fox   all the networks across all through the night as the polls are closing. You see the concession speeches and the great victory speeches, you see Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, Kasich, you see Donald Trump. You re waiting here at CNN, at MSNBC. They said he s going to hold a news conference  and that s it. Goodman continues, saying: Where was Bernie Sanders? Well, in fact, Bernie Sanders was in Phoenix, Arizona before thousands of people and as the networks were waiting for Donald Trump and waiting and all the pundits are weighing in, they don t even say that Bernie Sanders is about to speak. Commenting on how the corporate media has given Trump the world s biggest megaphone to preach his message, at the expense of covering all other major candidates, Goodman says: I think this exposure for Trump is frightening. Yes, there is now some critical coverage. But for the year 2015, as the snowball rolled and it got larger and larger, he got 23 times the coverage of Bernie Sanders. It comes down to ratings. Trump gives the corporate media an opportunity to create and sell an information-like-product, that can be quickly reproduced with almost no manufacturing cost. Speaking of manufacturing, Goodman borrows a phrase from Noam Chomsky, alleging that the media is  manufacturing consent  with their election coverage.While Chomsky may have popularized the phrase, its origins come from the master of media manipulation, Edward Bernays. He has a far more apt expression for the phenomenon that Goodman is addressing   crystallizing public opinion. As long as Trump remains in the election, the corporate media s ratings will continue to benefit from his status.You can watch the interview below, in full.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw4tKd9823QFeatured image from video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

As a racist xenophobe who probably wants to f*ck his own daughter, The Donald has absolutely no issue convincing conservatives that he is the perfect person to represent their interests.

Collectively, our nation is screaming  f*ck Donald Trump    something we can see illustrated in a video from the Ultra Music Festival in Miami. During an afternoon set, MAKJ stopped the music to comment on a sign one of the attendees was holding. F*ck Donald Trump,  the DJ said as he tossed a middle finger into the air.  I see that sign back there. I see you.  MAKJ then led the crowd of 10,000+ in screaming f*ck Donald Trump  before returning to the music.Hearing this crowd of young people take a stand, however small, against the hatred espoused by Trump and his followers is heartwarming. While he is popular with the elderly and the  poorly educated  (a group he especially  loves ), the rest of us just stare in horror when we realize that he is going to be the Republican nominee. We ve seen Trump give his supporters permission   repeatedly   to beat black men at his rallies. He tweets out white supremacist propaganda and retweets Klansmen (in a single week in January, 62% of his retweets were white supremacists). And, of course, he wants to throw Muslims in concentration camps and build a wall to keep brown people from crossing into the United States from Mexico.Conservatives view him as exactly the man America needs to take us back to the  good old days  when black people were common tree decorations in the South   but the rest of us just want him gone.Watch the video below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In the past decade or so, Mr. Trump and his foundation have contributed a total of $56,000 to our organization. These undoubtedly were sincere gifts,  said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO.

The announcement was made in advance of Trump s planned speech to AIPAC, the pro-Israel American Israel Public Affairs Committee.ADL also  called on other groups, philanthropies and nonprofits to consider redirecting charitable funds given to them by Mr. Trump into similar initiatives to combat hate, promote tolerance, and build a stronger American community. Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO of ADL, specifically referenced Trump s rhetoric   especially his  penchant to slander minorities, slur refugees, dismiss First Amendment protections and cheer on violence. During the campaign, Trump has said he would look into measures to curtail the First Amendment rights of the media with regards to stories he felt were unfair towards him. He has called for protesters at his rally to be punched, knocked out and manhandled (his campaign manager was recently caught on video grabbing a protester by the collar).A centerpiece of Trump s campaign has been attacking undocumented immigrants, blaming them for rape and drugs.

Trump is in the George Wallace tradition,  Will said in reference to the staunch Alabama segregationist who ran for president back in 1964 and 1968. Will continued by saying that Wallace said that  there s too much dignity in American politics, we have to have more meanness. Will noted that unlike Wallace, Trump has support all of over the country, but pointed out problems Trump and the Republican Party face. The problem is this. Not only are his negatives at 61 percent   almost double his positives, they are at 32 percent   but he s appealing entirely to white people. Will explained that appealing for white votes is not enough for any national candidate to win elections anymore unless they receive a ridiculous percentage of the vote and that candidates must receive a sizable percentage of votes from other ethnic groups as well if they want to achieve victory in 21st century America. Mitt Romney got 17 percent   that s all   of the non-white vote. Trump, by every measure, would do worse than that. Which means he would not have to get just the 65 percent of the white vote to win that Ronald Reagan got, sweeping 49 states. He would have to get 70 percent of the white vote. A, it won t happen and B, it would destroy the Republican Party by making it the party of white people. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Trump s incendiary remarks about Hispanics and Muslims and the way his supporters have treated black protesters during rallies makes it highly unlikely he will capture many votes if any at all from those voting groups.When President Obama won a second term in 2012, he did so with 75 percent of the Hispanic vote and only less than half of eligible Hispanic voters actually showed up to vote. Trump s hateful comments toward the Hispanic community make it more likely that that both percentages will rise in 2016 to the benefit of the Democratic candidate.And not only did African-Americans have a higher turnout rate than white voters in 2012, 93 percent of them voted for President Obama.The outright racism of the GOP in this election cycle could very well be enough to drive pissed off Hispanics and African-Americans to the voting booth in droves.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Looking back at all of the offensive, ridiculous things that Republican front runner Donald Trump has said over the past few months, it seems that Trump would probably have a more promising career in stand-up comedy than politics. But unfortunately for the rest of us, Trump is still a leading presidential candidate for the Republican party and continues to say more insane, delusional nonsense every day.One of the latest Trump ramblings reveals just how little Trump cares about the safety of America s youth. Maureen Dowd recently wrote a column about the front runner, pulling from a recent interview she had with Trump. Like every interview the business mogul partakes in, it s absolutely insane.Trump performed his typical bullying tactics, from insulting  total whack job  Megyn Kelly and attacking Elizabeth Warren   before hilariously denying that he was a misogynist or racist. Trump said, Honestly, I m with the people. The people like Trump.  While that s pretty bad, the most shocking part of the interview came when Trump spoke about his rallies, which have become infamous for their violence.Despite the fact that he has absolutely encouraged violence at his rallies and even promised to protect his supporters if they attacked a protester, Trump continues to deny that his campaign events are anything but peaceful. In fact, over the last few days he has blamed the outrageously rabid behavior of his fans on both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Trump s dishonesty and delusion run so deep that when Trump was asked if parents should be concerned about bringing their children to rallies where cursing, physical assaults and bullying are par for the course, Trump said this: The rallies are the safest places a child could be. Trump was then questioned about a particular incident in which a man rushed the stage, causing him to visibly quiver in fear. Trump, denying that he felt he was in any danger at all, said, I got credit for that because it looked like I was moving toward him.  He also said that when his protesters scream at  agitators  or protesters,  it adds a little excitement. Clearly, Trump s rallies are NOT a safe place for a child, and it s terrifying that Trump is denying this and ENCOURAGING his supporters to bring their kids into such a chaotic, unstable environment. The scary thing is, Trump s supporters hang on to his every word and are probably too dense to know any better.While Trump continues to deny that his rallies are extremely dangerous, several more incidents of violence happened at a Tuscan, Arizona rally yesterday   ironically the same day that Dowd s column about Trump was published. During the rally, a man was punched, kicked and stomped on the ground, and Trump s own campaign manager was seen grabbing the collar of a protester. Previously, Trump s campaign manager was accused of assaulting a female reporter.And those are not isolated instances. This type of violence follows Trump everywhere he and his protesters go. These attacks are sometimes racially motivated, and sometimes for no reason at all (attacks on peaceful protesters have become quite common). Suggesting that parents expose their children to the type of bigotry, racism and all-around disgusting behavior that we ve seen from Trump and his minions is despicable. Through his denial and lies, Trump has greatly endangered America s youth.Featured image via Gage Skidmore""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Worse, it even flags voters who may have the same first and last name as another person, but an entirely different middle name.Not surprisingly, the interstate cross-check system overwhelmingly impacts minority and Democratic voters.During a March 10, 2016 interview with Lee Camp, Palast described the likely impact of the interstate  crosscheck  system on the 2016 election.Watch the interview below:Palast first began sounding the alarm over inaccuracies in the interstate  crosscheck  system in 2014.A thirty-minute special report titled  Jim Crow Returns: Interstate  Crosscheck  Program threatens Millions of Voters,  provides a closer look at the list of voters who have been impacted by the bogus system.Watch the full report below, via Greg Palast on YouTube:Millions of voters are likely to be kicked from the voter rolls between now and November, if they haven t been already.One of the most important things voters can do to protect their voting rights is regularly check their status as a registered voter.As we get closer to the general election, republicans will step up their efforts to disenfranchise as many democratic voters as possible.Lee Camp s third video in the series Seven Ways To Beat The Ballot Bandits drives the point home:Go here to find out what else you can do to preserve and protect your vote.Image credit: video screen capture via Greg Palast on youtube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This, he claims, justifies any assaults his supporters unleash at his rallies, no matter how unprovoked.Unfortunately, there is not a lot of proof that the protesters are the people starting violence. One man who was recently sucker punched by a Trump supporter who thought he was from ISIS (he wasn t) was actually already being escorted out by police officers when he was attacked. He had done absolutely zero harm to anyone when he was hit with an elbow coming fast from his blind spot.So lacking any real evidence, it seems that Trump s campaign now wants to instigate fights between supporters and protesters in order to  prove  that it s not Trump s rhetoric that is inciting violence   and they were just caught on tape.At a tense rally in Tucson, Arizona, Trump s controversial campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, (who has already been accused of assaulting a reporter at a separate rally) was filmed yanking the collar of protester, and then letting the man next to him take the fall for it. It s startling to watch, but look closely.Here is Donald Trump s campaign manager in the Tucson crowd grabbing the collar of a protester. pic.twitter.com/JZ9RntWlHY  Jacqueline Alemany (@JaxAlemany) March 19, 2016Because honesty has no meaning in Trump-land, this obvious attempt to incite a fight was flatly denied by the campaign. They claimed the man to the left of Lewandowski was the perpetrator, a premise absurd enough to rank up there with the most audacious lies of North Korea or Soviet Russia.Back in the real world, the video clearly shows Lewandowski placing a hand on the back of the protester s shirt, grabbing a fist full of collar and yanking. When the man turns, Lewandowski lets go and watches as the protester and the man standing next to him get into a shoving match. He doesn t even bother to intervene. This is what he wants.Trump s rally was attended by conservative Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who runs portions of the state like his own personal dictatorship so it s unlikely any criminal charges will be brought against Lewandowski. However, it is worth nothing that Trump barely escaped a  inciting a riot  charge for his violent rally in North Carolina just two weeks ago. The reasoning was that Trump s actions and words are whipping his followers into a violent frenzy that makes it unsafe for protesters. Now his campaign has been caught red handed trying to   say it with me   incite a riot once again.This will go one of two ways: Either Trump s campaign gets charged with the crimes they are committing, or they are going to get their wish and someone gets killed.

The demonstrators can be seen moving out of the way, some obviously panicked, while others attempt to stop their assailant from moving any further.It might be expected that the police who were present would wish to stop the driver, but they can clearly be seen on the video providing an escort, even shoving around people who are attempting to stop the driver whose appointment with Trump was more important than the safety of the demonstrators.Fortunately, no one was injured, though this incident makes it clear that the cops were there for one purpose: to protect Donald Trump rather than the people.In 2014, a vehicle moving at a similar speed plowed through a crowd of Michael Brown supporters. While it was not moving quickly, one protester s leg became trapped by the wheel and she was dragged at least 20 feet before she was able to free herself. Like the operator of this Jeep, the driver kept going with zero regard for the assembled crowd.It is unclear why police chose not to intervene, but it is noteworthy that law enforcement reaction to the protest is managed by anti-Hispanic bigot, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who recently endorsed The Donald. Is it any wonder that his men did not care about the safety of anyone who was not there to worship Trump?Watch the video below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It was, they said, evidence that black people were inferior because white communities didn t have those kinds of problems.Republicans played to this racism with the Southern Strategy, which told poor white people that everything was OK as long as they were better than Those People. More importantly, if they just voted for the GOP, Republicans would stop Those People from taking their jobs/white women/opportunities/etc. And it worked really REALLY well. Poor white people flocked to elect Republicans who then gave trillions away to the rich and threw some crumbs at the poor people that elected them in the first place.But then the economy collapsed and while it hit the black community harder, millions of working class white people were suddenly in the same situation: No job, no money and no future. The result? A massive increase in dug and alcohol abuse, suicide and crime.In other words, they responded in much the same way economically devastated black communities did (but for your own safety, don t TELL them that!)Now, a rational person would look at this and say,  Aha! So it s NOT some kind of moral failing on the black of Those People! It s Poverty and the lack of Economic Opportunities!  But the conservative elite are not rational. They re the new French Aristocracy. They re so dedicated to the premise that the Have Nots are morally, intellectually and spiritually inferior that they have begun to turn on their own base despite their matching skin tone.Over at the National Review Online, the right wing s premiere thought leader, you will find a growing hostility to poor white people. In a piece by Kevin Williamson, you will find this lengthy screed denouncing the Republican base for siding with Trump against their masters:It is immoral because it perpetuates a lie: that the white working class that finds itself attracted to Trump has been victimized by outside forces. It hasn t. The white middle class may like the idea of Trump as a giant pulsing humanoid middle finger held up in the face of the Cathedral, they may sing hymns to Trump the destroyer and whisper darkly about  globalists  and   odious, stupid term    the Establishment,  but nobody did this to them. They failed themselves.If you spend time in hardscrabble, white upstate New York, or eastern Kentucky, or my own native West Texas, and you take an honest look at the welfare dependency, the drug and alcohol addiction, the family anarchy   which is to say, the whelping of human children with all the respect and wisdom of a stray dog   you will come to an awful realization. It wasn t Beijing. It wasn t even Washington, as bad as Washington can be. It wasn t immigrants from Mexico, excessive and problematic as our current immigration levels are. It wasn t any of that.Nothing happened to them. There wasn t some awful disaster. There wasn t a war or a famine or a plague or a foreign occupation. Even the economic changes of the past few decades do very little to explain the dysfunction and negligence   and the incomprehensible malice   of poor white America. So the gypsum business in Garbutt ain t what it used to be. There is more to life in the 21st century than wallboard and cheap sentimentality about how the Man closed the factories down.The truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible. Forget all your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap. Forget your sanctimony about struggling Rust Belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily Orientals stealing our jobs. Forget your goddamned gypsum, and, if he has a problem with that, forget Ed Burke, too. The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles. Donald Trump s speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin. What they need isn t analgesics, literal or political. They need real opportunity, which means that they need real change, which means that they need U-Haul. I was shocked at the tone. The absolute loathing for poor and working class whites is so thick you couldn t cut it with a chainsaw. This is the kind of hatred usually reserved for black people and liberals. But it s obvious this is not a newly formed opinion by Williamson. The dripping condescension of  Forget all your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap. Forget your sanctimony about struggling Rust Belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily Orientals stealing our jobs  reveals a long held contempt for what conservative elites like Williamson usually refer to as  The REAL America. And just to make sure the conservative elites are on board with how terrible and degenerate these poor (white) people are, NRO s David French quotes that entire segment above and then adds his own hate:These are strong words, but they are fundamentally true and important to say. My childhood was different from Kevin s, but I grew up in Kentucky, live in a rural county in Tennessee, and have seen the challenges of the white working-class first-hand. Simply put, Americans are killing themselves and destroying their families at an alarming rate. No one is making them do it. The economy isn t putting a bottle in their hand. Immigrants aren t making them cheat on their wives or snort OxyContin. Obama isn t walking them into the lawyer s office to force them to file a bogus disability claim.He goes on and on and on about how they ve been seduced by welfare checks and food stamps and now they re just lazy (sound familiar?).These two rich and privileged men are finally dropping the charade that the real war in this country is based on race. It never was. Race was a ruse used by the rich to keep the poor squabbling while they stole the country. But now that the 1% has broken the economy for EVERYONE, not just minorities, poor white people are furious at the people that promised them they would be better than Those People.The rich and their mouthpieces can t help but be enraged by the lack of gratitude on display. Did they not drop crumbs for the poor to feast upon? Did they not pass laws to make life even worse for blacks and gay people? Now the poor whites that give the rich their political power are expecting to be treated like people? How DARE they?!We are witnessing the end of conservative politics as we know it. The rich were able to keep the poor distracted with shiny objects and race baiting but now they re in open warfare against each other with no realistic way to mend the schism between the greed of the rich and the needs of the poor.Get more popcorn, it s going to be quite a show.Featured image author generated""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Your body is a temple, but it s also a museum of natural history,  the narrator says in the introduction. Look closely and you ll see parts that aren t there because you need them, but because your animal ancestors did. No longer serving their previous function, but not costly enough to have disappeared, these remnants of our deep history only make sense within the framework of evolution by natural selection. The video goes on to list several body parts that some people have that are not necessary such as a vestigial muscle in the forearm that can be seen by placing the top of your wrist on a flat surface and touching your pinky with your thumb. Some people have this long tendon band that is commonly found in lemurs and monkeys that need it to grip tree limbs. Approximately 10 percent to 15 percent of people are missing that tendon because we don t  scramble through trees  anymore.Then there are the three muscles attached to our outer ear. These muscle remnants were once a useful nocturnal tool for detecting the direction of sounds and is still found in cats and other mammals. But we have evolved from needing these muscles because we no longer need to survive in the wild forest at night.Goosebumps are yet another leftover vestigial group of muscles, albeit tiny ones, that activate in the effort to increase the amount of space for insulation, which is useless to humans now because we are no longer covered with fur like other mammals.Humans also once had tails, but they are yet another vestigial body part that has disappeared over time because we evolved to no longer need them, so the tail cells die before a full tail develops, which is why we only have tail bones while other mammals develop full tails. As it turns out, human embryos look similar to other vertebrates at 4 weeks in development, complete with a tail. Some humans are still born with a tail that is surgically removed.The video then talks about the palmar grasp reflex, which is found in human babies as well as chimps and other monkeys that allow them to grip whatever is put in their hand. Incredible footage from the past shows a baby holding on tightly to a bar while hanging down, thus demonstrating our  inner monkey. Here s the video via YouTube.This video about human evolution is similar to a video demonstrating the evolution of hippos and whales and how they are related to each other.While that video also made conservative  Christians  blow a gasket, this latest video featuring human evolution ought to make them absolutely explode. So it s perfect to share with any conservative you know. And then just sit back, relax, and watch the fireworks.

However, it generally doesn t happen that way. Most sexual assault occurs at the hands of someone the victim knows   this is usually referred to as  date rape,  or  acquaintance rape.  That is what makes these cases so difficult to prosecute. That is also what makes things like the processing of rape kits and other physical evidence following an assault so vital. However, one Idaho sheriff has gotten the idea in his head that most rapes are  consensual sex,  and thanks to that, he doesn t think his state needs laws making sure rape kits get processed.However, following rightful public outrage, Bingham County Sheriff Craig Rowland is backpeddling. He took to the Sheriff Department s Facebook page to try to explain just why he made the outrageous and despicable assertion that most rapes are actually, to use his words,  consensual sex.  Here is this neanderthal s Facebook  apology : I want to explain what I was trying to say in the interview. I misspoke when I said the majority of our rape cases are consensual sex. The meaning behind my statement that has been misunderstood is that when a case is called into the dispatch center each and every one is thoroughly investigated. A Deputy is sent to every one of these cases and that Deputy then in turn contacts the on-call detective to help with the investigation. In some of these cases through the investigation it may be determined that the sex was consensual, but not always. In these types of cases after the investigation is complete and it was determined that the sex was consensual. I don t believe that those kits should be sent to the lab. Then, as if that sorry excuse for an  apology  weren t enough, Rowland then went on to go down the old  I m sorry if you were offended  road, and then proceeded to paint HIMSELF as a victim here, talking about  cyber-bullying : I know that it is hard for victims to come forward on sexual assault cases. I spoke to a rape victim today and told her that I knew it was hard for her to come forward. I want to apologize to anyone who I might have offended with my statement as my main responsibility is to the public s safety and well being and maintaining their trust.,  he wrote.  I can also say with regret that I now know what it is like to be cyber bullied. Not only have I been threatened but so has my family. I hope that this will clear things up a bit. Sure, it clears things up, Sheriff Rowland, but not in the way you think. What you ve said here is no different from what you said before. You re victim-blaming. Nine times out of ten, if a woman says she was raped, she was. You say yourself that it s hard for victims to disclose. So, why the hell would anyone make something like that up? It s men like you, Sheriff Rowland, who keep rape culture alive and well.You have no business in law enforcement, and I sincerely feel for the rape victims for whom you are their only source of so-called  help.

The National Football League has issued a statement on Georgia s so-called  religious freedom  legislation, House Bill 757. NFL policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard,  NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in a statement.  Whether the laws and regulations of a state and local community are consistent with these policies would be one of many factors NFL owners may use to evaluate potential Super Bowl host sites. The Falcons are currently building a new stadium in Atlanta, which is slated to open in 2017. They were hoping to host a Super Bowl there in either 2019 or 2020. The league has often given new stadiums, particularly in warmer climates, an opportunity to host the championship game.The law in question would allow faith-based groups to refuse service to people if that service violated the group s religious beliefs. That has re-ignited fears of discrimination against LGBT Americans enshrined in the law. This would allow organizations to discriminate against LGBT people or single mothers who have no ministerial function within the religious organization, like a janitor, a cafeteria worker, an administrative assistant,  said Anthony Kreis, a professor at the University of Georgia and an expert in constitutional law.Arthur Blank, co-founder of Home Depot and owner of the Falcons, opposes the bill. He said it  would have long-lasting negative impact on our state and the people of Georgia. Like what happened in Indiana, hundreds of business leaders oppose Georgia s  religious freedom  law, which now awaits the signature of Governor Nathan Deal, a Republican, to become the law. Deal had previously said he would not sign a bill that allows discrimination. Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In fact, his legendary stupidity was used as a selling point. He wasn t an  elitist  because he didn t (or couldn t) use big words and never excelled in school. His opponent, Al Gore, his supporters claimed was too smart. A major turn off for them.Trump seems to be banking on the same anti-intellectual thinking.

Now they are saying they want to wait until the lame-duck period after the election to make a final decision.Of course, we all know why they want to do this all of a sudden. A centrist like Garland may be the best Republicans can get, especially if the Democrats retain the White House in November. If that happens we can expect Republicans to eagerly confirm Garland in order to prevent a more liberal nominee from being nominated. And if Republicans win the White House they ll wait until 2017 so a more conservative nominee can take the position instead.In other words, Republicans are playing a duplicitous game of politics and the GOP consultant on board the panel actually had the stones to admit that his party is playing politics in an effort to keep the Republican Party from blowing apart. Because if they balk now, they risk pissing off their conservative base. Mitch McConnell knows one thing very clearly,  Rick Wilson said.  If they allow an Obama justice to go forward at this point it will blow a gigantic hole in the Republican coalition like we have never seen before. They have drawn a bright line, they have sworn this is a line they re not going to cross  After Wilson said he s a  shameless political guy,  Maher chimed in by asking,  Aren t you an American first? Wilson responded by saying there is nothing in the Constitution keeping Republicans from doing what they are doing and that GOP leadership is telling the base that they ve drawn a line to keep President Obama from having a lasting legacy on the Supreme Court.Well, that didn t impress former longtime congressman Barney Frank. I spent 40 years as an elected official. I ran for office 20 times,  Frank told Wilson.  I understand the role of politics, but I am disappointed, Rick. The explicit elevation of the need of keeping your coalition together over the functioning of the federal government is awful. Frank went on to say that there is a need for an odd number of Justices on the Court because an even number could lead to tied rulings that don t settle cases and agreed that this is about restricting President Obama to a three year term. Yes, it s in the Constitution that Obama gets to make an appointment,  Frank continued.  And what McConnell is putting forward is a nonsense theory, namely that it s only a 3-year term. Frank also expressed his hope that Republicans would have taken the opportunity to to pull back from their rabid base a little bit because of Donald Trump but it appears they have no intention of doing that. Instead, they appear to be doubling down on their allegiance to the base at their peril.Maher then re-introduced a word he came up with years ago known as  blacktracking,  which is when Republicans change their mind because President Obama agrees with them. As it turns out, it happened again this week because Republicans had no problem with Merrick Garland being nominated for the Supreme Court until President Obama nominated him this week.Here s the video via Twitter.Watch @BillMaher and the #RealTime panel discuss the GOP s  blacktracking  over @POTUS s SCOTUS nomination.https://t.co/5iiG9vrtBp  Real Time (@RealTimers) March 19, 2016 Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This week the state senate took the next step in the battle against bigots and zealots having to acknowledge the law of the land by passing a bill that eliminates marriage licenses in the state altogether.Yes, rather than forcing clerks and judges to put their stamp of approval on what will undoubtedly cause the end of civilization as we know it, Senate Bill 143 takes the state completely out of the marriage game. Residents would instead sign affidavits of a civil union, which clerks would receive and record. That way, when the trumpets sound and the archangel Gabriel descends to turn Mobile into salt, those who issue marriage licenses will be able to stand at the pearly gates and plead their case to St. Peter with a clean conscience.The bill, which reads, All requirements to obtain a marriage license by the State of Alabama are hereby abolished and repealed. The requirement of a ceremony of marriage to solemnize the marriage is abolished,  has been dubbed the  three way bill  by critics because it makes marriage between two people and their attorney. State Senator Greg Albritton told reporters: When you invite the state into those matters of personal or religious import, it creates difficulties. Early twentieth century, if you go back and look and try to find marriage licenses for your grandparents or great grandparents, you won t find it. What you will find instead is where people have come in and recorded when a marriage has occurred. Early twentieth century, if you go back and look, was a time before marriages had to be legal for income tax purposes because there was no income tax. It makes no difference what way Alabama Republicans try to spin it, this is bill is designed to save Christians from having to treat the gay community as people under any circumstances. The proposed law would still maintain a few state requirements for a civil marriage contract: Minors between the ages of 16 and 18 would still need parental permission and the state would refuse to record a marriage contract if either party was already married or related by blood or adoption.The funny thing is, had every state adopted a law just like this one when the issue came about, there would have been no need for a court case or a SCOTUS ruling. Two people dedicated to each other could enjoy all of the legal and tax advantages of their union while still being free to marry as their faith allows or requires, without interference from bigots at the clerk s office.We would also have had the added advantage of never having to hear the name Kim Davis.Featured image from AlabamaConnection.org""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He said:  I m not saying he s Hitler or anything, but there is definitely something chilling about his cadence, his toying with demagoguery and longing for the days when we could sic the dogs on protestors and be done with these unseemly interruptions. This used to be funny but is now getting a little too close for comfort. (Although tactically, this may be the best thing for a more reasonable alternative because people in the United States would never vote for this guy for real, right? Right?) After watching this cartoon, one can t help but be puzzled at how this individual, who does not seem bright by any stretch of the imagination, and is clearly dangerous, has a shot at the most powerful position on earth. It s a frightening prospect. That s why it s so important to vote in November.Here s the video: [vimeo 159170550 w=500 h=281] Featured image via video screenshot.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He is the grown-up version of every pain-in-the-ass kid who ever sat behind you on a plane kicking the back of your seat. While the parents did nothing    Little Logan  is just exploring.

Trump s rise, Maher argued, was not fueled by racism or xenophobia, but by what he called  the self-esteem movement.  As proof, Maher played a montage of clips showing Trump saying how he s the best at many things. He said: Like they say on reality shows, the most important thing is just  You doing you.  But what if you is a big a*shole? Maher said the real reason Trump wants to be president is not to help America but so he can be called president.

Cruz then goes on to add his life goal is to take over the world and be rich and powerful. The horrifying thing is if he is elected president, he would certainly use it to succeed in the latter, and his foreign policies would probably align with aspirations for world domination.Most recently, a high school yearbook photo of Ted Cruz has surfaced, and there is nothing endearing or nostalgically relatable about the photo. Ted Cruz went transferred to Second Baptist High School in his Junior Year of High School. Not surprisingly, Cruz desperately tried to assimilate with the cool kids, and by all accounts failed miserably. He was very active in drama club though. Cruz loved being on stage, even if it meant being the villain,  reported NPR in July 2015. In junior high school, he had played Rolfe, the young Nazi in The Sound of Music. He landed the role of the murderer Bill Sikes in Oliver during high school. The yearbook photo taken depicts another one of Cruz s creepy roles in high school, as a biblical mime, supposedly depicting the first man, Adam. In an interview with the Daily Dot, the photographer of the yearbook photo, Mark Neath, could not recall taking the photo, but did remember Cruz s strange life aspirations. I do distinctly remember him boasting that he would become president one day,  Neath wrote to the Daily Dot.

We had information that he was attempting to contact a 14-year-old girl online, and that kicked in the Internet Crimes Against Children team. They were monitoring a lot of his stuff, and found out through his communications that there was a significant amount of drugs at his home. Tasker was arrested on March 1, and faces felony charges for the attempted solicitation of a minor.He is also facing three felony-level drug charges, after a search of his home turned up marijuana, hallucinogenic mushrooms and the prescription drug Suboxone. Police say the drugs were packaged for sale.Before his arrest, Tasker was a member of the state legislature s Committee on Children and Family Law, described as a body of lawmakers  which deals with all matters relating to children and youth, their rights, obligations, and protection and the application of criminal laws and sentencing for children. Tasker is the same New Hampshire lawmaker who got national attention in 2012, after he dropped a loaded gun during a meeting of the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee.In 2014, he made a series of offensive Facebook posts, which also drew national criticism.In one post Tasker suggested that he should be allowed to join the Black Caucus because he likes rap music.He also said he wished he could join a  white caucus of state legislators. In another post he made light of domestic violence, by joking about eating  battered women. When asked about Tasker s arrest, some New Hampshire lawmakers said they were not at all surprised by the drug charges, claiming that he often came to meetings smelling of pot and alcohol.When asked if Tasker s behavior was a poor reflection on state lawmakers, however, representatives placed the burden on the voters who elected him three times.

The full statement:Donald Trump s vitriolic attacks against Megyn Kelly and his extreme, sick obsession with her is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate who wants to occupy the highest office in the land. Megyn is an exemplary journalist and one of the leading anchors in America   we re extremely proud of her phenomenal work and continue to fully support her throughout every day of Trump s endless barrage of crude and sexist verbal assaults. As the mother of three young children, with a successful law career and the second highest rated show in cable news, it s especially deplorable for her to be repeatedly abused just for doing her job.Trump has been whining and complaining about Kelly ever since she confronted him in the first Republican debate with his history of sexist and misogynist comments about women. Here s video of that moment:Trump then accused her of bleeding out of her  whatever  and later boycotted a debate on Fox because Kelly was on the panel of moderators.The friction between Fox and Trump is strange, because the right-wing network has set the antagonistic and nasty tone towards American life that Trump has capitalized on.

The legislature plans to underfund the state s revenue to catastrophic levels by removing income and corporate franchise taxes. It s not a silly concern since Kansas Republicans have had what can only be considered a post-apocalyptic budget and economy ever since they pulled these same shenanigans there.Guidry s letter is as follows: It is irresponsible of our leadership to suggest eliminating income and corporate franchise taxeswhen: revenue projections are already down, budgets for various services are being cut across the board, funding for public education and other critical services such as child care, foster care and roads/bridges are underfunded.

But on Friday came the first sign that political pressure over the court is getting to some in the party.Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois is up for re-election in a state that voted overwhelmingly for President Obama in 2012, and he has now become the first to give in.Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk took shot at his Republican colleagues on Friday for refusing to hold a Senate hearing and vote on President Barack Obama s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. Just man up and cast a vote. The tough thing about these senatorial jobs is you get yes or no votes,  Kirk told  The Big John Howell Show  on Chicago s WLS-AM.  Your whole job is to either say yes or no and explain why. Kirk realizes that he needs some Democrats to back him in his race against Rep. Tammy Duckworth, and that his own party s petulant insistence to not even give Judge Garland a hearing is hurting them.Garland was nominated in part due to past statements from Republicans like Senator Orrin Hatch, who said his strong record and credentials would make him worthy of a nomination and consideration by Republicans, even if nominated by a Democrat.In other ways Republicans have begun to crumble on Garland. They originally said they wouldn t even meet with him, as is customary for nominees. But now some Senate Republicans have decided that the optics of refusing to answer the door when Garland comes calling would make for bad television and fodder for Democrats in the fall election.Republicans are being squeezed even further with the news that front-running presidential candidate Donald Trump also believes that Garland s nomination should be rejected out of hand without hearings. As polls show Trump could be a drag on the party in the fall, they are being forced to demonstrate ways that they aren t marching in lockstep with him, and in fact working towards a situation where Trump is the one picking the next Supreme Court justice.Their kneejerk opposition to the nomination offered by Obama is going to have to last for about nine months, and as Kirk has shown, that may be impossible in the long run.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Edwards wrote a letter to Trump calling for him to end his campaign.In the letter, Edward writes that he did not view Trump s campaign as a joke like most people did. Edwards writes in the letter: Mr. Trump, when you first announced your bid to be Commander and Chief of this nation, the american people immediately dismissed your campaign as a complete joke, but not me. I genuinely believed that the people should take the time to listen to your campaign, I told others that it s possible that you may have something to offer, but in reality, I was very wrong. At that point, Edwards goes on to list some of the things that Trump has become known for over the past few months in the election. This includes the endorsement that Trump received from former KKK leader, David Duke. Trump s non-stop scapegoating of Muslims, immigrants, and people of color.Those, however, are criticisms anyone can make. Edwards, on the other hand, has a very good question that Trump would hate to answer. What exactly is so great that Trump is offering? Which is exactly what every Trump supporter should be asked. Why would Trump s America be great for a young black man living in Flint? Do you not see the message that you are sending to us? Why would someone like me even be interested in your America? Can you even give me ONE real reason why I should believe that I have an actual shot as a black teenager in your America? As far as I know, you haven t done anything to reach out to OBVIOUSLY concerned communities like mine. Please remember, I am a Flint resident, and like other members of this community, we are wondering why you and other republicans alike haven t reached out to us. The U.S. is a mosaic of people. Trump s America might be great for you if you are well of financially and are white (it still probably won t be, though). For everyone else, it would be a disaster. Every WASP supporter that Trump has to have at least one person in their life that would fall into the everyone else category.Edwards ends his blistering letter to Trump calling for him to end his campaign. Edwards writes: Mr. Trump, it is obvious that you are not interested in uniting this nation, and with the growing threat of violence within your campaign, I believe as a moral adult, that you MUST end your campaign to prevent people from getting hurt any further.

To make it a bit more modern, the state Senate voted 37-8 to both officially reaffirm Maryland, Oh Maryland  as the official state song, and to remove the words  Northern scum so that citizens of the state can finally sing it without feeling a stinging sense of shame. Maryland, Oh Maryland  was penned in 1861 and adopted as the state song in 1939. Talking Points Memo notes that it is unclear why the song was adopted at that particular historical moment but notes there had been two recent lynchings in the state and the NAACP was then advocating for equal pay for black teachers.  In other words, it probably was not selected because people enjoy singing to the tune of   O Tannenbaum. By enshrining a Confederate war anthem, the General Assembly may have been seeking symbolically to challenge such efforts,  the AP notes.The song is pretty inflammatory. Currently, it ends with a rousing call to fight against those dirty northerners who wanted to end slavery: She is not dead, nor deaf, nor dumb   Huzza! She spurns the Northern scum! She breathes! She burns! She ll come! She ll come! Maryland! My Maryland! The song refers to President Abraham Lincoln as a  despot  and urges Marylanders to  burst the tyrant s chains.  The changes keep one verse from the old lyrics and add one from an 1894 poem describing the natural beauty of the state of Maryland   something more appropriate in modern times than complaints about Lincoln and calls for an armed uprising. They keep the historic song. It s still there, but this bill is an excellent compromise to move forward, so that our children and our children s children and so that all Maryland can be proud of our state song,  said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller (D).  At the present time, all of Maryland cannot be proud of our state song, and so that s the reason I m voting green. Changing the song is a completely reasonable action, given its inflammatory speech   so naturally, Fox News fans became rather incensed when they learned about what they view on an assault on their heritage (whether they are from Maryland or not). Some complained about rap music for some reason, while others threatened to take up arms against the government. Others whined about black people, some said that this is a form of white genocide (the systemic elimination of the white race that Donald Trump s supporters in the KKK believe is happening), and others still hold out hope that the South will rise again. And, of course, there were the customary calls for President Obama s death that accompany literally everything that happens in the world:                     Unfortunately, this is where we re at as a nation   and Donald Trump s rhetoric has given these people, who would normally keep their shameful and idiotic opinions to themselves and their local Klavern, the courage to speak out. Whenever someone tells you that Republicans aren t racist, we d tell you to show them this, but we all know they will simply claim that the hundreds of similar comments are left by  liberal plants  who want to destroy America   no matter how much evidence exists that this attitude is no longer the minority in the Rapublican Party.The bill is set to go to the House, where it is expected to pass   a good thing for the state of Maryland, but something that will likely cause at least a few acts of violence against African-Americans. It s just what conservatives do these days.Maybe next, legislators can hop on board the effort to change the name of Negro Mountain   or at least take down the numerous highways signs and remove the picnic area.Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The film s World Premiere was featured at the Sundance Film Festival this past January, and is continuing along the film festival circuit, with the next screenings scheduled for the Cleveland International Film Festival later this month. Filmed over the course of three years, the documentary features interviews with family members of those who were lost, first responders, and school staff members, as the event changed the course of all their lives forever.Despite the incitement caused by the tragedy in Newtown for government legislators to make policy changes which would help prevent future Adam Lanzas from committing similar horrible crimes, those calls fell on deaf ears in Congress. Instead, mass shootings continue to occur across the United States, while no action is taken to decrease their frequencies. Instead, states like Texas, West Virginia, Florida, and most other states in the country allow open carry guns without any sort of special permit.

Unlike most politicians who dance around issues, Sanders is a straight talker and he doesn t shy away from telling it how it is. Whether his style emanates from decades of activism and politics, or whether it s just as a result of experiencing life, his style is refreshing, especially for a politician.His approach was on display on Thursday when he spoke at a rally attended by thousands of Native Americans at Twin Arrows Navajo Casino east of Flagstaff, Arizona.  The culture of Native Americans is so rich, so important, that all of us will gain by preserving it,  he said.Sanders conceded that the US government has not treated Native Americans well and that he would work to better the relationship once he becomes president. He said: Native American people have been lied to, cheated, and negotiated treaties have been broken. Often, Native American people have not been heard on issues that affect their communities. They have been told what to do, they have not been involved in the process. Sanders also touched on issues directly affecting the Native American community, promising to work to raise the minimum wage once he becomes president. Directly addressing  Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who has threatened to take away state support from cities that set their own minimum wage higher than the state s, Sanders said:I say to this, governor, I ve got some bad news for you, we re going to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. I will fight for a $15 minimum wage, there s nothing the governor can do about it. It is stunning to me that a governor would want to prevent the minimum wage from going up. Sanders also discussed his idea of tuition free public education, an idea that can empower a generation of Americans and prevent them from sinking into college debt as previous generations have. He said: The world has changed, the economy has changed. People today need more education. When you talk about public education today, you need to talk about making public colleges tuition-free. I believe we need to have the best-educated workforce in the global economy. It makes no sense to me that we have hundreds of thousands of people who are not getting an education because they can t afford it. All people would be eligible. Sanders, whose rallies have drawn thousands, drew cheers from the crowd. His ideas are attractive to millions of Americans and if last night s rally is any indication, the 2016 Democratic nomination for the presidency isn t over by a long shot.Watch Video Here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmIYRl9Ofns]Featured image via Wikimedia Commons ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But these Americans weren t ready to take no for an answer. One of them quickly countered, Ted Cruz can do it. Trudeau reminded them that Cruz was  born as an American  because although Cruz was born in Canada, his mother was an American citizen.Then Trudeau s admirers began to get desperate. One of the men said, All our guys are so bad, you ve gotta believe us. We ve met  em all   they re so terrible. Please. His companion added, They re boring, weird. We have to settle for them. Please. Trudeau stood firm and said, You know what, I have tremendous confidence in the American people. Then, both men literally dropped down to their knees and pleaded with Trudeau: We ll do anything. We re begging you. We re literally begging you. Trudeau simply responded, I don t know if you noticed, but I actually have a job, and it s a pretty good one.

Matt Shea and others, knew Ammon and Ryan Bundy were planning to illegally lead an armed takeover of federal property in Oregon before it happened, and they chose not to warn law enforcement.Fiore, Shea, and other GOP lawmakers are part of a group known as the Coalition of Western States which seeks to force the federal government to surrender federally protected lands to the states.Greenlee County, Arizona, Commissioner Robert Corbell, who went to Nevada to support Cliven Bundy s standoff with the Bureau of Land Management in 2014, admitted to OPB that after being a largely ignored group after that confrontation ended, the Coalition of Western States caught wind of another standoff that would be going down in Oregon and kept quite about it so that their group could get more attention for their illegal cause.Corbell told OPB that coalition leadership knew Ammon Bundy planned to take over U.S. government property in Harney County before it happened, but were unsure which federal outpost it would be.We knew he was going to do something,  Corbell said.COWS believes it is unconstitutional for the federal government to own land even though the Constitution specifically gives the federal government the power to own and regulate lands through what is known as the Property Clause.Article 4, Section 3, Clause 2 states:The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.Yet, Fiore and her fellow GOP lawmakers actively conspired to spark a land war with federal authorities in an effort to force the government to comply with their demands and give up their constitutional powers.OPB reports that despite being warned by Judge Steve Grasty during a meeting to stay away from the militants so as not to  embolden  them and cause the occupation to last weeks or months, Fiore and her little band did so anyway.The lawmakers acknowledge they fed the militants information gathered from that meeting, and militant leaders talked openly about what they learned from those disclosures.These Republicans literally presented themselves as negotiators with the intention to end the standoff so that they could enter the seized compound and help the armed militants extend the hostilities.The lawmakers wanted information from law enforcement, including what tactics the FBI anticipated taking against the militants. They wondered aloud, for example, whether refuge power would be cut. Law enforcement personnel repeatedly declined answering. The lawmakers continued to ask.They also wanted to know what criminal charges the occupiers might face. After getting nowhere with that line of inquiry, coalition members asked with whom they could negotiate on behalf of the Ammon Bundy-led militants.Former Washington GOP state Rep. Graham Hunt also participated in the meeting and actually attempted to persuade the FBI into agreeing with militant s demand for a transfer of federal lands. Would it be possible for somebody, whether it s the U.S. Attorney s Office, to say that  We agree that there needs to be a conversation at another level,  Hunt asked.But wait, there s more.Fiore and the coalition aided and abetted the militants in more ways than just feeding them information and trying to coerce the FBI from doing their job. They also helped organize press events and enlisted Anthony Bosworth, a failed candidate for Sheriff, to act as a  security specialist  at the compound. Bosworth even helped militants flee the occupation when it became clear that the FBI wasn t messing around.In the end, Fiore and her group decided that since the jig was up, they might as well look like the heroes, so they reluctantly convinced the last of the militants to surrender.And now they have another goal. They want to keep the Bundys and their fellow terrorists from facing significant criminal punishment for their crimes. They re even going so far as to tell the arrested militants to learn the names of the judges and prosecutors, perhaps as some sort of way to intimidate them into dropping the charges or going easy on them.Here s the report via OPB.The fact is that Republican lawmakers knew this standoff was going to happen and did nothing to prevent it. One person was actually killed and many more could have died on both sides because these sorry excuses for politicians chose to pursue their agenda rather than keep the public safe.Add in the fact that these lawmakers basically acted as spies against the United States by gathering and passing information to the militants as well as egging them on to keep the standoff going longer than it would have and it s clear the FBI needs to arrest and jail a few more people.These Republicans conspired against the United States by aiding the militants and warning them about what law enforcement was doing to end the standoff. They don t belong in places of political power. They belong in prison awaiting sentencing for treason. Featured image via Twitter ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Louise Mayerson has been through a lot in her 84 years on this planet, coming from a  family who was forced to flee Austria when she was a child to escape Adolf Hitler s regime   but now she is forced to relive the terror her family felt as they fled the Nazis.Mayerson  s letter, published March 2, criticizes Trump s initial reticence in denouncing the numerous, numerous white supremacists who have publicly endorsed him:I AM an Austrian refugee from the time of Hitler who has been a US citizen for more than 70 years. I have found some alarming rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that is apparently finding approval from large numbers of my fellow Americans. With Trump s rather ambiguous response concerning his disavowal of the support of former Klansman David Duke, I have reached my breaking point ( Trump wavers on disavowing ex-KKK member,  Page A2, Feb. 29).We all know the opinions and actions the Ku Klux Klan stands for. Among the fellow Americans the KKK has sought out for its venom are American Jews. Trump s failure to immediately repudiate Duke chilled my blood.I can see myself needing to flee once more and perhaps return to my native country in Europe, where hateful rhetoric is now strictly forbidden and punishable by law. My outrage grows and grows and grows,  Mayerson said in an interview following the publication of her letter.  And it s flamed by the irresponsible actions, frankly, of Donald Trump. Unfortunately, the 84-year-old s expression of her completely legitimate misgivings about Trump s association with white supremacists was enough to throw them into a fit of rage. Days later, she received an envelop postmarked in Boston, There was no return address   after all, the Klan isn t exactly known for being forthcoming with their identities. There wasn t even a letter. Enclosed was a single Klan symbol: I believe somebody just read that letter, it touched a nerve, and that s the way they reacted,  Mayerson said. She contacted Arlington police, who are currently investigating the matter. They also contacted the Human Rights Commission, which assists hate crime victims. Mayerson says she is pleased with law enforcement s response, and that she is distressed by the   poisonous atmosphere that has been created  by Trump s rhetoric that can   lead to some pretty unpleasant things for all of us. Robert O. Trestan, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, says that Trump s rhetoric will help this sort of thing to become commonplace: The more that hateful and denigrating speech becomes commonplace in the public realm from leaders, the greater the likelihood that people will start acting up, whether it s harassment via the mail or violence. A Trump spokeswoman refused to comment on the incident, though she did point out that the candidate did finally denounce his David Duke endorsement after he was unable to handle the media scrutiny: Mr. Trump has disavowed David Duke, the KKK and all other groups that espouse similar views. He will continue to do so. Trump may say he disavows the KKK and other white supremacists, but in the past he has tweeted some of their propaganda. In fact, based on a week of data collection, 62 percent of the people Trump retweets are white supremacists. Unfortunately, The Donald is exactly the sort of person who is popular with the White Power Rangers in the United States   and as long as we tolerate his hate speech, we can expect that this sort of thing will become the new normal.Featured image via YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

According to family members, she was growing increasingly paranoid. She claimed there were bombs planted in her home and thought there cameras hidden inside her five-year-old son s shoes.At one point Atkinson had threatened to kill herself and take her son with her.Shortly before Kenny Kreuscher s mother put a .22 rifle to his head as he lay sleeping, the little boy told his father that his mommy had punched him.Ken Kreuscher Sr. recorded the conversation with his son, documenting marks left on the child by his mentally ill mother, hoping that someone would intervene.Over the course of the past year, Ken Kreuscher had filed numerous police reports and contacted child protective services multiple times. He d gone to court to try to get an order of protection. I ve been telling everyone in court this was a possibility that this would happen,  Kreuscher said during an interview with Denver s KDVR, on March 11.But while Kreuscher raised the alarm over and over, no-one intervened on his son s behalf.At the beginning of March, the Colorado mother left the state with Kenny, traveling to Roundup, Montana.On March 5, while still in Montana, she shot the little boy in his sleep. She then turned the gun on herself.The five-year-old died 12 hours later.Here s more on the story from KUSA.There s a fine line between violating the rights of person who has been diagnosed with mental illness and protecting the lives of innocent people.Under federal law, a person who has been deemed to be a threat to themselves or others is not supposed to be able to possess a gun. The problem with the law, however, is that there are very strict rules about when and how a person with serious mental illness is determined to be a  threat to themselves or others. In the case of Sara Atkinson, although the people closest to her, including her own son, were sounding the alarm about her mental health, the law offers little help.While it s unknown where Sara Atkinson got the gun that she used to kill herself and her child, there was likely no law preventing her from purchasing or owning a gun, in spite of the warning signs in her behavior.Restrictions on gun ownership are limited to people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution, people who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity in a court of law and people who have been found incompetent to stand trial.At one time, local law enforcement officials were far more likely to err on the side of caution, requesting gun permits and licenses be revoked in cases where a person s behavior suggested a potential threat.For example, until 2010, local law enforcement officials in Tennessee could ask the state to revoke a gun permit in cases where a person  poses a material likelihood of risk to the public. But second amendment nuts challenged the state s law, calling it a violation of gun owner s rights.Thanks to the NRA, all across the country, it has become increasingly difficult to limit anyone s access to a gun.Today, even when all of the warning signs are there, it s nearly impossible to revoke a person s  right  to own a gun.Image credit: video screen capture via KUSA""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Yet Republicans still expect those people to have jobs, which is kinda hard if they have no mode of transportation to get to work every day.According to the Montgomery Advertiser,The legislation would cut eligibility for Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF) from five years to three. It would also require TANF recipients to sign a paper acknowledging they would stick to the requirements of the program, including those related to work. The bill would also prevent the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) from seeking work waivers for those receiving SNAP, and would also require EBT cards for recipients of public benefits to have photos on them The bill would also change asset calculations, which currently allow those receiving benefits to own items like cars. The legislation would end that.In short, if you re poor and you own a car, you have to choose between feeding your family or having transportation. And if you re forced to choose, more than likely you would choose feeding your family and ditch the car. However, Republicans also want food stamp recipients to sign a promise that they ll get a job, and that s the catch. If the only job a poor person can find is miles away, how the hell are they supposed to get to work on time every day to fulfill the requirements Alabama Republicans are forcing upon them, especially if they live in a rural area where there is no public transportation? And what if you re family is so poor that your car IS your home? Then Republicans would be forcing families to choose between food and shelter.That s the precise reason why Democratic state Senator Rodger Smitherman blasted the bill and sponsor GOP state Senator Arthur Orr during the committee vote last Wednesday. I m going to do whatever I can to stop this,  Smitherman angrily declared.  I am not going to let you do this to these people. I am not going to let people starve. There s no provisions in there that guarantee employment if you go through those steps. The committee passed the bill by a 10-3 vote and it will now go to a full vote in the Senate where it is likely to pass the GOP-dominated body and could very well become law if the Republican-controlled House passes it as well and the Republican governor signs it.And once it becomes law, children are going to be the ones who feel the hunger pangs the most since 77 percent of TANF recipients in the state are kids, giving further credence to the charge that Republicans only care about children until after they are born.The Republican war against the poor continues on.Featured image: Children s Defense Fund""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Oregon is now reaping the financial benefits of legalizing the sale of the marijuana. Reports show that just after one month, Oregon has taken in $3.48 million dollars in new tax revenue.This is incredible news for the state of Oregon. The state initially expected to bring in a total of $2 million dollars of new tax revenue from marijuana sales   for the entire year. Not every county and city in Oregon has chosen to allow the sale of marijuana. That means 19 counties in Oregon will receive a share of the tax revenue.Oregon Live reports on some of the details of the state s marijuana tax policy: Oregon s medical marijuana stores have been allowed to sell a limited amount of cannabis flowers, as well as starter marijuana plants and seeds, to anyone 21 and older since last October. The state s temporary 25 percent tax didn t kick in until Jan. 1.That tax will eventually be replaced with one ranging from 17 percent to 20 percent once the Oregon Liquor Control Commission assumes control over recreational marijuana sales later this year. The Legislature set the base tax rate at 17 percent, but cities and counties may adopt ordinances that add up to 3 percent more.Next year, the first full year of sales under the liquor commission, state economists expect recreational cannabis sales to generate $10.75 million in tax revenue after the state covers startup costs. That number is expected to climb to $62.42 million for the 2017-2019 biennium. Other states that have legalized recreational marijuana have received similar tax windfalls. Colorado, the first state in the U.S. to legalize marijuana, took in $135 million dollars in taxes and fees in 2015. Colorado is pumping most of their new tax dollars into schools and other education initiatives.The state of Washington raised $67.5 million dollars in tax revenue from recreational marijuana in 2015. They are expected to raise more than $1 billion dollars over four years. This money goes into Washington s general fund and to help fund health services.Of course, marijuana is still illegal on the federal level. So far, the federal government has decided to respect state s marijuana laws. The federal government s attitude towards recreational marijuana can change, for better or worse, depending on the whim of the administration in charge.Featured image from Katheirne Hitt via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Author and columnist Dan Arel writes in Pathos that a group called the Tri-State Freethinkers are raising $2,000 to place billboards which name the Ark Adventure Genocide and Incest Park. Image via IndiegogoThe Indiegogo page for the project states:The billboards are likely to serious annoy the Ark Adventure team, who have lurched from one crisis to another in their attempts to set up the site.Australian-born Creationist Ken Ham and his fundamentalist Christian organization Answers in Genesis (AiG) are looking to build a $101m Ark Adventure in Kentucky, with the centerpiece of a reconstructed Ark. The problem is, they want you the taxpayer to pay for it.According to Newsweek, AiG purchased a 99-acre plot of land just outside Williamstown, Kentucky got the city for just a dollar five years ago. But since then, the project has hit one hurdle after another. Many, of Ham s own making.The principal issue at stake now, is that Ham and AiG want the taxpayer to pick up the bill for around a quarter of the construction costs of the project in the form of tax rebates. The group sought to exploit subsidies provided by the state to boost tourism through the Tourism Development Incentive program. Projects of $1 million and upwards can recover 25% of project development costs by recouping their sales taxes.After much debate on their initial application, Kentucky approved the site for the scheme so long as AiG agreed to non-discriminatory hiring practices. This means, they could only recover the cash if they recruited people of all faiths and none. They could not specifically hire Creationists.A few bumps down the road later, and Ham and AiG had to significantly strip back their pans for the park. They were unable to gather together the funds and investment to create the full theme park. Due to the substantial changes to the plans, they had to resubmit their application to Kentucky for the tax rebate. This time is was denied. Why? Because apparently, honesty and integrity mean nothing to this group of creationists.Despite their reluctant agreements to get their hands on state cash, AiG had released a decidedly discriminatory recruitment policy for the Ark Adventure. The website demanded a salvation testimony  and a creationist statement of faith from all prospective job applicants   clearly ruling out non-believers.So now, Ken Ham and AiG are suing Kentucky for the money   claiming religious discrimination. Greg Lipper, senior litigation counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State points out the muddled-thinking that AiG is applying in this case. AiG is confusing what they have the right to do as a private organization with what taxpayers are required to fund, They re saying Kentucky taxpayers should pay for them to expand a religious ministry. That kind of argument would make Thomas Jefferson turn in his grave. No one is telling Ham as a private citizen, who or how he can hire.

It simply is saying, I believe in the equality of men and women and I believe that we still have an awful lot of work to do to get there.  Trudeau added,  It s just really, really obvious that we should be standing up for women s rights and trying to create more equal societies. Like, duh. Trudeau won election in October 2015 after a stunning comeback from third in the polls. He famously appointed an equal number of men and women in his cabinet, and cited his reasoning for doing so,  because it s 2015.  During the summit, he called on World leaders to follow Canada s lead when appointing their own cabinets. Any world leaders who tell me  I d love to, I just can t do that with the current configuration of our parliament or of my party , I say:  Well, what are you doing to change that configuration and draw out those extraordinary women who can be leaders that we need? ,  he told the crowd.His party, the Liberal Party, also recouped a majority in the Canadian Parliament. His election also inspired an increase of voter turnout by 7.4 percent to 68.5 percent. Trudeau won election on a campaign platform of progressive reforms, such as increasing taxes on the wealthy and dramatically improving infrastructure.

While that s pretty scary, there s something that might be even creepier: if one of Trump s minions wants to volunteer for Trump s campaign phone bank, they re required to sign a six-page binding contract that says they will never insult Trump (or his family members, businesses or campaign) for the rest of their lives! Should they use their constitutional rights to speak poorly against him, Trump will sue.Given how sensitive Trump is to insults nowadays (remember the fuss he made when former rival Marco Rubio insulted his hands?), it s not really shocking that Trump would make volunteers sign a loyalty oath. That, and the fact that Trump is absolutely egotistical and power-hungry.Last week, NBC reported that Trump was actually forcing campaign volunteers to sign contracts before they could begin helping him get elected after a strange email came to light. NBC said: In a Thursday email inviting supporters for phone-banking at Trump Tower, the campaign tells supporters to attend a briefing and then sign your NDA before volunteering begins. Here s a screenshot of that email:Via NBCA few days ago, The Daily Dot was able to obtain one of these free speech violating contracts. And yes, the contents are just as ludicrous as they sound: Promise and agree not to demean or disparage publicly the Company, Mr. Trump, any Trump Company, any Family Member, or any Family Member Company or any asset any of the foregoing own, or product or service any of the foregoing offer, in each case by or in any of the Restricted Means and Contexts and to prevent your employees from doing so. Part of Trump s contract, via Daily DotAlso in the contract are guidelines that volunteers are basically legally bound to Trump   they re prohibited to volunteer for any other presidential candidate, should they suddenly become sane and change their minds. There s no end date to these contracts, so Trump is pretty much making these people sign their lives away to him. Talk about making a deal with the devil The Daily Dot dug deeper and asked Davida Perry, an employment lawyer in New York City, if these contracts would actually be respected in court. Perry said that they wouldn t, and added: I guess [Trump] doesn t know about the First Amendment. This is really shocking. He s apparently so afraid that people would say something bad about him after spending some time on his campaign that they have to sign some sort of agreement. I don t see how this stands up. I don t see how a court enforces this. Well, Trump actually knows tons about free speech, but only acknowledges those rights when it will benefit him.

As you can imagine, his special brand of xenophobia and racism has caused a lot of white nationalists to feel comfortable with their hate for  others.  All you have to do is turn on a Drumpf rally and you can witness firsthand how insane his fanboys and girls are, but the acts of violence extend farther than his events   his supporters have hurt random people on the streets, as well.America s Voice writes: We ve seen the proof over the past few weeks. Trump s xenophobic rhetoric hasn t just pushed his fellow candidates to the right on immigration (in what has become known as the  Trump Effect ). It s gone beyond the political world and injected itself into everyday life In one incident, a Latino and two Muslim students in Kansas were attacked by a man who yelled racial slurs and warned them that Donald Trump was going to be president before punching one of them.His hate has even extended to elementary schools! A mother in Fairfax County, Virginia posted on Facebook and said that her third-grade son was taunted in school by two of his classmates. Apparently the children were spewing nonsense about immigrants that they d heard Trump say.Those are just two of the many incidents the organization found. The billionaire likens himself to some great  unifier,  but he is clearly nothing but a divisive asshole who will absolutely destroy this country if he were elected. Our country would probably look like it did in the 1960s with race riots all over the place.

Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson put his writing skills to use on Thursday to pen an epic rebuke of Donald Trump and the Republicans who support him. Trump pretty much represents the negation of everything I ve argued about politics and ideology for the last 30 years,  Gerson wrote on Facebook.What he is attacking is not just  the establishment.  He is attacking a way of doing politics based on persuasion, consensus, compassion and inclusion. Those who argue that conservatism is fundamentally at odds with these values know nothing of conservatism. But Trump represents the confirmation of the worse conservative and Republican caricatures   a belief that cultural and religious minorities are threats, a belief that America should abandon its deepest values in the conduct of global affairs, a belief that the values and institutions of our government have failed, and that the times require a strong hand.Gerson continued ripping Trump for wanting to tear down what makes America great.At its best (and, God knows, it has not always been at its best) America shows a welcoming spirit, an example of how a great nation can be united by ideals instead of bloodlines, a place, as George Washington said, where  there shall be none to make him afraid.  We should love American traditions and institutions enough to repair them, not hand them over to an authoritarian wannabe, who is too ignorant to even understand the inheritance he is casting away.And then he really let Trump have it.Trump s magical policy thinking, setting goals with no serious thought of how they might be achieved; his menacing encouragement of political violence; his disdain for ethnic and religious minorities, which has unleashed and emboldened racists and anti-Semites of every sort; his penchant for conspiracy theories, including a very dangerous vaccine denialism; his promises to conduct the war on terrorism by ordering war crimes, which would set up a constitutional crisis when the US military honorably refuses; his cynical manipulation of gullible religious leaders with tactics that border on blasphemy; his casual use of lies, which he defends even when exposed.Gerson then turned his focus toward the GOP and slammed them for supporting Trump even though he represents the destruction of all the progress America had made since gaining independence from Great Britain and damned them to regret it for all of time.How does any of this return lost greatness to our nation? Sometimes I want to shake people (intellectually,not physically) who favor political  disruption  and ask: Disruption in favor of what? Look at what you are doing! Look at what you have done! The Republican Party is now firmly harnessed to the wild, uncontrollable horses of fear and exclusion. It has already sustained damage with Latino voters that may take a generation to undo. And now many Republicans will find rationalizations to support Trump. That is natural   the reality of politics in every time. Many people simply go with the winner. But this isn t a normal time. I believe that the decision to support Trump, like an embarrassing tattoo, will follow them the rest of their lives. Republicans are not merely making a choice; they are looking into the abyss.Here s the full post via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;I feel bad, on one hand, to be so focused on (some would say, obsessed by) the Trump phenomenon.

The Super Tuesday polls revealed that Trump got 38.8 percent of the vote in Illinois, along with 49 delegates from the state.Despite running a campaign based on bigotry, violence and some of the most extreme rhetoric a presidential campaign has ever seen, Trump has been unstoppable   even though he hasn t proposed one solid solution that will actually  make America great again.  Trump has risen above negative reports about lawsuits from his failed businesses, his awful misogynistic track record with women, support from white supremacists, and constant flip-flopping and lies.

The comments were described by three people in the room for the event, all of whom were granted anonymity to describe a candid moment with the president. The comments were later confirmed by a White House official.Mr. Obama chose his words carefully, and did not explicitly call on Mr. Sanders to depart the race, according to those in the room. Still, those in attendance said in interviews that they took his comments as a signal to Mr. Sanders that perpetuating his campaign, which is now an uphill climb, could only help the Republicans recapture the White House.Interestingly, Obama s comments were made before Clinton swept all five states that held primaries this past Tuesday, which has given her a lead of 323 delegates over Senator Sanders.According to analysis of the remaining delegates left in the race   which are allocated proportionately instead of  winner take all    Sanders would have to win 60% of the remaining delegates in the primaries to come, which is unlikely.Clinton and her team have apparently begun to  pivot  towards the likely general election matchup against Donald Trump.

Romney alienated himself from half the American population in one fell swoop, handing an electoral landslide to President Obama. He re-surfaced in 2015 with a quick stint pre-campaign test, only to decide he wouldn t run again.in late January of this year, however, Mittens made sure his FEC paperwork was in order to be listed as a candidate for the election. While most presume he did what he had to to secure a spot on the ballot in case he gets nominated at a brokered GOP convention, there could be far more ominous issues with Mitt Romney and his political future.The Republican party is in a panic. Donald Trump is looking like he will be able to secure the nomination with more than 50 percent of the delegates, making a brokered convention an impossibility. Trump would at that point be the Republican nominee for president this November, which would fracture the GOP into an unrecognizable shadow of its former self. So what would the plan be at that point? To steal the election from under the noses of the American people and hand it to his own running mate, Paul Ryan, to decide with a vote in the House of Representatives.It s not really that complicated, either. According to the 12th Amendment, if no candidate reaches the number of electoral votes necessary to secure the presidency, a ballot will be cast by the House to decide the victor. If the GOP runs Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan against their own candidate as a third party choice, chances are that outcome could come to pass. The morons lining up to vote for Trump aren t the typical party base. While he has the fringe vote locked up, as well as the independent low-information voter, he ll never take the Koch-loving regulars away. Those people would rather vote for Hillary Clinton and take their chances on 2020 than watch Trump destroy their party and our country.So then, in an all-out battle between Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney, all the Republicans have to do is squeeze out enough votes from two candidates to keep Clinton under the 270 electoral votes needed to be elected. While that scenario seems crazy and unlikely, it has happened before. With enough voter obstruction and cleverly played lawsuits, we could witness a travesty that would give the Republicans control of all three branches of government, effectively destroying our country as we know it.Republicans are no good at winning elections fair and square. If they had to rely on the people to elect them, they would have died 20 years ago. People think they are refusing to consider a Supreme Court justice just because Obama is the nominating president. While that may be partially true, it also plays into the strategy of giving the vote to the House. If the Republicans contest enough results in blue states where conservative judges sit on federal benches, appeals to SCOTUS would end in 4-4 ties, leaving the lower court rulings in effect.The whole thing is an archaic constitutional mess that should have been addressed and done away with decades ago, but alas, it s here for this election cycle and it could jump up and bite our country where the sun refuses to shine.Featured image by Gage Skidmore""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Elijah Cummings made it clear that Michigan Governor Rick Snyder should face prison time for the tragedy afflicting the city of Flint.As Snyder sat waiting to testify about his and his administration s role in the Flint water crisis that has poisoned residents since 2014, Cummings kicked off the grilling by making it clear to Snyder that if he were a corporate CEO he would be hit with criminal charges already.Cummings began by noting that the special prosecutor in the case has already said that public officials, including Snyder and members of his staff, face prosecution because they knew about the crisis and did nothing. We re here to investigate what possible crimes there are, anything [from] involuntary manslaughter or death that may have happened to some young person or old person because of this poisoning, to misconduct in office,  Special Investigator Todd Flood said last month.  We take this very seriously. Cummings then read emails from top level members of Snyder s staff revealing that the administration knew of the crisis as far back as October 2014   shortly after the emergency manager Snyder appointed to control Flint switched the city s water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which had not been used for decades because it was unsafe for human consumption, all to save a minuscule amount of money in the budget. Now the crisis will cost Michigan billions of dollars to fix.In fact, The October email proved that Snyder had a chance to get ahead of the issue before the crisis became a huge deal because his Chief of Staff was advised to switch back to the Detroit water system as swiftly as possible to avoid the very crisis that has unfolded over the last few months.Cummings then laid into Snyder for allowing an  entire generation of children  to get lead poisoning which will cause serious health problems that will affect them for the rest of their lives. There is no doubt in my mind that if a corporate CEO did what Governor Snyder s administration has done, he would be hauled up on criminal charges. There will now be an entire generation of children who suffer from brain damage, learning disorders, and many other horrible effects of lead poisoning that were afflicted on them by Gov. Snyder s administration.Here s the video via YouTube.While questioning Snyder, Cummings said he found it  hard to believe  that he didn t know about the crisis until it was too late. once again pointing out that members of his senior staff knew in late 2014 that there was a serious problem brewing. After much back and forth about whether or not Snyder actually discussed the Flint crisis with his Chief of Staff, Snyder made a desperate effort to blame the state Department of Environmental Quality and the state Department of Health and Human Services. But Cummings refused to let Snyder off the hook. It seems like there are two basic possibilities. Either your chief of staff told you about these concerns and you did nothing, or he didn t tell you and you are an absentee governor. Here s that video via YouTube.Make no mistake, Rick Snyder is in the hot seat today and he s getting his ass handed to him right now. And he deserves it just as much as he deserves a pair of metal bracelets and an orange jumpsuit.Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But that s a subjective thing,  O Reilly claimed in defense of Trump. When you say that Mexican immigrants are criminals or rapists, that is   for many people   a racist remark,  Ramos shot back. But he didn t say all of them were,  O Reilly said before reading a Donald Trump quote about Mexico sending the worst of their citizens over the border to the United States. O Reilly even insisted to a stunned Ramos that all Mexican immigrants bring drugs with them.Ramos fired back with statistics proving that the vast majority of immigrants are law-abiding. But O Reilly shrugged off the statistics because he doesn t think it s fair to be countered with facts.Not wanting anything to do with facts, O Reilly went back to accusing Ramos and Univision of not being objective toward Trump. O Reilly accused Ramos specifically of  demonizing  Trump as a racist.However, considering what Trump has said about Muslims and Hispanics since his campaign began and the fact that white supremacists, the KKK, and neo-Nazis have flocked to his campaign to support him, it s fair to say that Ramos is absolutely right to label Trump a racist and it is amazing that other media outlets have failed to do the same.And that s why Ramos turned the accusations around on O Reilly himself, accusing him of not being tough on Trump. Of course, O Reilly objected even though he has repeatedly let the Republican front-runner off the hook. And the fact that O Reilly attempted on multiple occasions during this interview with Ramos to defend Trump s racism pretty much proved Ramos correct. You ve talked to him so many times, and you and Sean Hannity let him get away with everything,  Ramos declared.Then Ramos annoyed O Reilly with those pesky facts again as he reported that 81 percent of Latinos have a negative opinion of Trump because of the things he has said throughout his campaign. O Reilly tried to claim that they have a negative opinion because of Univision. You know, because all Latinos get their news from Univision and can t possibly have an independent opinion about Trump based on what he has said. I don t know what s in his heart, but I know what s coming out of his mouth,  Ramos responded about Trump when O Reilly complained that Univision hasn t called Hillary Clinton a racist. And then the interview ended.Here s the video via Media Matters.Donald Trump is a racist and any person looking at Trump objectively knows it. His words on multiple occasions cannot possibly make him look like anything else but a racist, especially when white supremacists endorse him and he fails to denounce them. Univision is actually performing a service for the American people by calling Trump what he is while other media outlets, especially Fox News, coddle him in order to draw ratings. It s a disgrace to journalism and Fox News and Bill O Reilly ought to be ashamed of themselves. Featured image via Dangerous Minds""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Colbert quips that Kasich would have to be made the governor of every remaining state in the U.S. in order for the candidate to have any real chance of winning the nomination.So, even though Kasich has not dropped out of the race, the only possible person left in the race who could defeat Trump is The Zodiac Killer Ted Cruz. That isn t good news for the GOP or the U.S. Cruz, while he has yet to start a race riot at a campaign event, is actually far worse than Trump in terms of policy. Cruz is also incredibly creepy. Colbert jokes at the idea of Cruz winning the Republican nomination, saying: If every single Trump voter unites behind him, he could get enough delegates to be the nominee. Then the GOP establishment can say,  Goodbye, candidate we don t like! Hello, candidate, we can t stand! If Cruz cannot secure enough votes to secure the nomination, Republicans will have one final shot at defeating Trump   a brokered convention. So if Trump doesn t get to 1,237 delegates in the first round of voting, they re all free to vote for whoever. Which is great news.

For instance, after Detroit finally was taken to task regarding rape kits that sat for years in an old warehouse, more than 100 serial rapists were identified.Now, the state of Idaho is advancing a bill that is designed to force crime labs and law enforcement to clear the backlog and stop shifting rape kits to the back burner. However, there is one sheriff in that state who is not at all happy about that. In fact, Bingham County Sheriff Craig Rowland s comments on the matter are downright infuriating. He said: I really believe the Legislature needs to take a strong look at allowing law enforcement to do their job and not try to dictate what we need to do. I think they re trying to help, I really do. They need to let us decide if we re going to send the kit and when we send the kits in. Because the majority of our rapes, not to say that we don t have rapes, we do, but the majority of our rapes that are called in, are actually consensual sex. This is reminiscent of old Todd Akin s  legitimate rape  comments. What these idiots need to realize is that if ANYTHING sexual transpires that a partner wasn t okay with, and (s)he said to stop, THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF RAPE.Luckily, pressure was put on Rowland for his comments, and he at least attempted to apologize. However, the apology is now deleted from his Facebook page, so he likely didn t mean it anyway. It can be read at Jezebel.Rep.

And in 2016 there is no sadder sad sack than Ben Carson. The one time presidential front runner has spent the past few weeks shamelessly stumping for a guy who once couldn t wait to spread vicious rumors about him. And all for the off-chance that Trump won t forget about him once he becomes emperor president.But wait, what about Chris Christie? Surely, the New Jersey Governor who has had to grin and bear it while Trump mocks him to his face while standing next to him at political rallies has had it worse! Sadly, not. Because as low as Christie s self-esteem gets   and it s gotten very low   there is something singularly depressing about the position Carson is in. After all, when you find yourself defending Donald Trump s comparison of you to a child molester, you ve dug a hole for yourself so deep that you re on your way to China.Alas, here s Carson doing just that.In an interview with Yahoo News, Carson was reminded of the time that Trump, in an egotistical rage, decided to link Carson to that of a child molester. But not before labeling Carson a  pathological liar  first. When he says he s pathological   and he says that in the book, I don t say that   and again, I m not saying anything, I m not saying anything other than pathological is a very serious disease. And he said he s pathological, somebody said he has pathological disease. That s a big problem because you don t cure that  as an example: child molesting. You don t cure these people. You don t cure a child molester. There s no cure for it. Pathological, there s no cure for that. Was Trump calling Carson a child molester? Of course not! He was merely saying Carson s  pathology  was of the same level as that of one. To which Carson responded on Wednesday: You have to admit to a degree [Trump comparing me to a child molester] did work. Adding: A lot of people believed him. Well said, Mr. Carson. Clearly you are a man of such integrity that you won t even defend yourself when a dumpster fire with a hair piece accuses you of being of the same mental health as a child predator. Gifted hands. No spine.Carson s endorsement of Trump has always seemed particularly vile because he had previously spent his entire campaign focused almost entirely on pretending to care about the  angry rhetoric  in the race. Repeatedly, he called for candidates to tone down the mudslinging (to no effect.) His  I quit  speech explicitly lamented the toxic state of the race. Here s how he described his ideal candidate:Carson stated that in choosing the next person to lead America, you d  need someone who has demonstrated significant accomplishment  whose ideas and policies are clear,  and whose character would be revealed by  how they treat others and their family.  We d also  need to see what they have done for America. And then he picked the exact opposite, Donald J. Trump.Featured image via Yahoo News""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

However, there was a very dark cloud that hovered over his visit once it was discovered that he would be meeting with Kim Davis, the controversial Kentucky County Clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.Well, it looks as though the ambassador who set up the visit, and apparently kept Pope Francis in the dark about the whole thing, is about to be replaced. According The Advocate: Italian Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan  will leave the position of apostolic nuncio, the equivalent of an ambassador, and will be replaced by Archbishop Christophe Pierre, a French-born clergyman who is currently the nuncio to Mexico, Catholic magazine America reports, citing Sandro Magister, a blogger who covers the Vatican.The Vatican is not expected to confirm the news until the Obama administration has agreed to the new nuncio s appointment, the magazine notes, but it adds that  reliable sources  expect an official announcement before Easter, which falls on March 27 this year. Back in October after the visit with Davis, the Vatican released an official statement declaring that Pope Francis  meeting with the County Clerk  should not be considered a form of support.  Also stating: The brief meeting between Mrs. Kim Davis and Pope Francis at the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, DC has continued to provoke comments and discussion. In order to contribute to an objective understanding of what transpired I am able to clarify the following points:The Vatican clearly went into crisis mode to very clearly clarify that Pope Francis was not supporting Kim Davis and her bigoted ways, as was originally construed. Now, with the replacement of the man who set the whole meeting up, it has been made extremely clear that this sort of thing isn t about to happen again.Kim Davis is a symbol of hate and bigotry, so to see Pope Francis, who has all too often been a shining symbol of hope and love, meet with Davis, it honestly broke a lot of people s hearts. And while the Pope is still not in favor of same-sex marriage, it s definitely a positive development to see that the responsible ambassador will be replaced. Pope Francis was clearly not pleased.Featured image via Wikipedia/Wikipedia/Wikipedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But in the ad, it doesn t seem like Trump likes Putin at all   it even seems like he s trying to destroy their mutually respectful bond.

These federal lawmakers are supposed to represent the nearly 203 million people in their congressional districts.While 76 percent of voters believe that climate change is very real problem which must be addressed, these representatives spend their time in Washington fighting against any legislation that help tackle the problem.As Think Progress reports here, these legislators have received a total of $73,294,380 from  dirty energy companies in the coal, oil, and gas industries. Even more revealing, Think Progress reports that dirty energy money characterizes climate deniers in Washington: In general, the average career dirty energy contribution per Senate denier was $889,101, compared to $207,272 for those who had not publicly revealed themselves to be deniers. The average House contribution was $274,365 per denier, and $92,000 for non-deniers. In total, House deniers pulled in $39,508,554 in dirty energy money, while deniers in the Senate pulled in $33,785,826. These facts show that GOP climate change deniers, like Texas representative Joe Barton, are getting huge amounts of money to push an agenda laid out by the fossil fuel industry, even though it flies in the face of science.Barton has collected nearly $2,100,000 from dirty energy contributors, according to an interactive map published by Think Progress, here.Heading into the November elections, the map serves as a useful tool for voters who would like to weed out climate deniers in Congress. It allows voters to search for climate change deniers by state, and to view the extent of industry contributions each legislator has received in return.The American people deserve a Congress that reflects their priorities, not the priorities of dirty energy companies.To find out which representatives in your state deny the reality of climate change, check out the map published here.Watch Bill Nye explain the reality of climate change in four minutes.

Grayson is known for his productivity in congress getting bills amendments proposed and passed, but he is also well known for irking Republicans and his fellow Democrats as well.

Translation: If Obama s nominee gets through, our conservative majority will be destroyed for years and we won t be able to attack women, minorities, immigrants and fight for the one percent. McConnell continued: So, of course, the American people should have a say in the court s direction. It is a president s constitutional right to nominate a Supreme Court justice and it is the Senate s constitutional right to act as a check on a president and withhold its consent the Senate will continue to observe the Biden rule, so that the American people have a voice in this momentous decision. He went on to say  Biden rule  about fifty more times and try to pin Senate Republicans  refusal to do their job on the vice president.

But if they are never tested to find DNA matches, victims never get justice for the heinous crime done to them.And that s why Georgia Democratic state Rep. Scott Holcomb sponsored House Bill 827 to finally test the outrageous backlog of rape kits that have remained in storage, some of them for decades, and get justice to the victims.The bill enjoyed bipartisan support across party lines, which is rare these days. But Georgia GOP state Senator Renee Unterman ruthlessly blocked the bill in committee because she claims the bill has been  overly politicized  and demanded to be shown evidence of the backlog because she apparently doesn t believe one exists. If there was a problem, I would be Johnny on the spot and I would have written the legislation. I think he really overly politicized it in an election year and I ve got a problem with that. There s no reason to write a law just because it makes you feel good. I ve been asking that representative to show me where the back log is, show me where this rape kits are? Here s the video via CBS46.WTVM.com-Columbus, GA News Weather & Sports But Unterman is wrong. According to an investigation by CBS46 in 2015, thousands of rape kits have been discovered waiting to be tested.CBS46 found that both Athens-Clarke County and Cobb County police departments recently uncovered hundreds of rape kits that hadn t been sent to a crime lab for processing. ACCPD found 159 untested kits dating back to 1993, while Cobb police identified 365 untested kits dating back to the 1970 s.CBS46 also reports that  Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta reported it has 1490 untested kits in its rape crisis center. And Georgia isn t the only state where such a massive backlog exists. CBS46 also reported that thousands of rape kits have gone untested in Michigan and Texas as well, but it s disturbingly common across the nation.Senator Unterman ought to be ashamed of herself. She had a chance to help rape victims get justice and she refused to take it. And women should be outraged enough to vote her out of office, because as Madeleine Albright once said, there s a special place in hell for women who won t help other women, and it looks like Unterman has already booked a room.

There were also confirmed reports from a third voter in Winter Haven precinct also being turned away on the same false pretext.

What s even better is that he picked someone who is such a centrist that the GOP is going to look really silly when they oppose him.Obama held a press conference in the Rose Garden on Wednesday and announced his support for the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Merrick Garland, 63, as the next justice of the Supreme Court. President Obama praised the judge in his speech, saying: I have selected a nominee who is widely recognized, not only as one of America s sharpest legal minds, but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency, modesty, integrity, even-handedness, and excellence. These qualities, and his long commitment to public service, have earned him the respect and admiration of leaders from both sides of the aisle. He will ultimately bring that same character to bear on the Supreme Court, an institution in which he is uniquely prepared to serve immediately. Today I am nominating Chief Judge Merrick Brian Garland to join the Supreme Court. When Justice Scalia passed away in February, the right immediately said that they would oppose anyone who the president chooses to replace him. They have even pledged to not even open their doors for the nominee. This led a lot of pundits to speculate that President Obama would pick a centrist who would make the Republican Party look ridiculous if they opposed his nomination and that is exactly what he did.Garland has spent nineteen years on the federal bench and is not known for deciding things based on his ideological views. Although he is a moderate justice, he has ruled in favor of Republican causes in the past.In 2003, for instance, Garland ruled that Gitmo detainees did not have the right to seek relief in civilian courts. This ruling was so controversial that when his name was floated as a replacement for Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, in 2010, liberals were quick to speak out against him. Meanwhile, the Republican Party praised him as a brilliant  judge. Doug Kendall, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center, said: He s won the admiration of everyone around him by taking the job of a judge seriously and engaging in conversation with his colleagues, rather than confrontation. Carrie Severino of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, said at the time: of those the president could nominate, we could do a lot worse than Merrick Garland. He s the best scenario we could hope for to bring the tension and the politics in the city down a notch for the summer. This was an incredibly smart move for President Obama. Although liberals are not going to be entirely thrilled with the moderate justice, he is a fine jurist with a long list of accomplishments. However, Republicans are going to have a really hard time opposing a man whom even conservative Orin Hatch has called  a fine man. Ultimately, they will oppose him because they are obstructionists who care little about the Constitution and everything about blocking Obama.Ultimately, they will oppose him because they are obstructionists who care little about the Constitution and everything about blocking Obama.

But NBC rained on his parade by releasing the video he never wanted us to see. The compilation underscores the lack of integrity of the candidate.In the video, Trump is being asked about a powerful new ad against him, funded by the Our Principles PAC, in which women read out the toxic comments Trump has made against other women.Introducing the segment, host Matt Lauer takes a clip of Trump speaking on Good Morning America on Tuesday, and follows up with his statements on Today just a few minutes later, revealing how the candidate gives a totally different story in each interview. This is what happened: He talked to ABC first.   Here s what he said when asked about that ad,  Lauer states, rolling the footage.We see Trump on Good Morning America, stating that: Well, you know, I have seen it. And it was a Romney deal, Lauer then moves to the second clip, saying: Just a couple minutes later, he appeared live on this show. Here s what he had to say, In the next clip, filmed literally minutes after his previous statement, Trump has a completely different story. Honestly, I have not seen the ad. So I would have to see it. I have heard about the ad, but I have not seen the ad. So, just minutes apart, Trump has gone from saying that not only has he seen the video, but claiming to know that Mitt Romney is behind it   to revealing that he hasn t even seen the footage.So far the Trump campaign has made no formal response to the video, but it is highly embarrassing for the candidate who claims to be bringing a fresh, plain-speaking approach to politics. But of course, it s no surprise to anyone actually bothering to fact-check Donald Trump. After all, a recent study by Politico which analyzed more than 40 hours of footage from the Trump campaign found that candidate lies on average every five minutes.

Speaking to his audience at a St. Patrick s Day luncheon on Capitol Hill, Obama slammed the GOP s  vulgar and divisive  campaign, making a noticeable jab at GOP front runner Donald Trump s routinely violent rallies and hateful rhetoric toward women and minorities. The president said: We have heard vulgar and divisive rhetoric aimed at women and minorities, at Americans who don t look like us or pray like us or vote like we do. We ve seen misguided attempts to shut down that speech. However offensive it may be, we live in a country where free speech is one of the most important rights we hold. In response to those attempts, we ve seen actual violence. And we ve heard silence from too many of our leaders.Too often, we ve accepted this as somehow the new normal. And it s worth asking ourselves what each of us may have done to contribute to this kind of vicious atmosphere in our politics. Obama said the current presidential race wasn t an accurate depiction of America, and it has to stop. You can watch part of Obama s powerful speech below, which earned him a standing ovation from lawmakers in both parties:Obama later urged politicians to think of America s youth and renounce the violence, stating that We should not have to explain to them this darker side  in America s politics: In America, there is no law that says we have to be nice to each other, or courteous, or treat each other with respect. But there are norms. There are customs. There are values that our parents taught us and that we try to teach to our children to try to treat others the way we want to be treated. At one point during the luncheon, Obama faced House Speaker Paul Ryan and said that the two men should be able to treat each other with respect despite their different views on policy. Obama said, as Ryan nodded back, I don t have a bad thing to say about you as a man. I know you want what s best for America. Obama s powerful message to the GOP candidates comes just as front runner Donald Trump is denying the worsening violence that has plagued his rallies by calling his campaign events  love fests . Trump is also now lying about the fact that he has encouraged more violence by telling his supporters he will pay for any legal fees they might be faced with from attacking protesters.

And now, Dr. Ben Carson has backed the real estate mogul. However, Carson may have just revealed why he actually threw his support behind Trump   and the reason may actually be illegal.While being interviewed on Newsmax, Carson seemed to imply that he was offered an  advisory  position in Trump s potential administration in return for an endorsement. One big problem with that, though. Offering a role in exchange for an endorsement is against federal law.Carson said: I didn t see a path for Kasich, who I like, or for Rubio, who I like. As far as Cruz is concerned, I don t think that he s gonna be able to draw independents and Democrats unless he has some kind of miraculous change  Is there another scenario that I would have preferred? Yes. But that scenario isn t available. However, expanding on what cemented his decision, Carson said: I will be doing things as well   Certainly in an advisory capacity [in Trump s administration] We haven t handled out all the details but it is very important that we work together in this country  Again, I m not going to reveal any details about it right now because all of this is still very liquid. Which leads any person with common sense to realize Trump clearly offered Carson a role in exchange for his support. However, according to the federal legal code: Whoever, being a candidate, directly or indirectly promises or pledges the appointment, or the use of his influence or support for the appointment of any person to any public or private position or employment, for the purpose of procuring support in his candidacy shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if the violation was willful, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both. Carson very may well have led to the chance of federal charges being filed against Trump. Will that happen? Likely not. Should it? Most definitely. Trump is gaming the system and seems to be promising favors. It s scandalous at best, and most definitely illegal.Here s the video via Think Progress:Featured image via YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The photographer shot to fame six years ago by photographing people on the streets, documenting and sharing a small piece of their lives with the public. Since then, his popularity has grown tremendously and Stanton has photographed and interviewed notable figures such as President Barack Obama and Syrian refugees   using his tremendous influence to make a statement. Stanton s letter to Trump is no different, but carries an entirely different tone as the photographer has labeled the offensive candidate  hateful  and  racist. First admitting that he was hesitant to become involved in the election, Stanton explained why he was choosing to speak out against the front runner now: I try my hardest not to be political. I ve refused to interview several of your fellow candidates. But I realize now that there is no correct time to oppose violence and prejudice. Because along with millions of Americans, I ve come to realize that opposing you is no longer a political decision. It is a moral one. In the letter, Trump was also called out for the racism and violence that he encourages not only in his Twitter rants, speeches and interviews, but at his rallies as well. I ve watched you retweet racist images. I ve watched you retweet racist lies. I ve watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy. I ve watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to  pay the legal fees  of those who commit violence on your behalf. Stanton also spoke about the people he s gotten to interview around the world   such as Muslims in Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan, and Syrian and Iraqi refugees   the very people that Trump warns his supporters about. Stanton blasts the GOPer for comparing refugees to  snakes , claiming that  Islam hates us and  gleefully tell stories of executing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood.  The photographer railed against Trump s hateful rhetoric and lies: Over the last two years I have conducted extensive interviews with hundreds of Muslims, chosen at random, on the streets of Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan. I ve also interviewed hundreds of Syrian and Iraqi refugees across seven different countries.And I can confirm  the hateful one is you. Stanton ends his scathing letter by saying that even if Trump changed his tone, he will never be able to truly  rebrand  himself as  presidential  or a  unifier    because he s not. Stanton wrote: Though your words will no doubt change over the next few months, you will always remain who you are.

We think Trevor Noah might just have found it.Speaking on the Daily Show, Noah said: I hope there are two Donald Trumps   that way he can go f*ck himself Yep that just about does it.But Noah s whole rant delivered a brutal drop kick to the Trump campaign and its cynical use of every dirty tactic in the book to gain power   with near total disregard for the consequences.

Turning to the ever-escalating racist violence spilling out of Trump rallies across the country, Noah didn t mince his words either. Here s the truth: Donald Trump didn t just create an atmosphere for violence at his rallies, he engineered it as carefully and deliberately as Matt Damon did when he was growing potatoes on Mars. Finally the host appealed to fans of Trump s opponents to avoid confronting Trump fans, or attempting to shut down their rallies, saying: If you come in, and you actually try to silence them, it s like trying to put a fire out by putting wood onto it, You ve given Trump the villain that, up until now, he was making up.

They hoped to leverage its toxic contents by turning it into votes for their establishment candidate. Instead, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have been given the chance to take over; two men who would have been unelectable in almost any ballot in modern times.

She gave Trump s followers a chance to show a better side of themselves and they blew it. Bee didn t cheat. She didn t walk into a roadside bar and grab a couple drunks with KKK t-shirts on. She invited a diverse array of Trump supporters: women, gay, black, Asian, college graduates, bi-partisan. All were represented. The common theme: none of them were able to put forward a single coherent response when asked the most simple questions about their candidate. And when pressed, all hit the hot button of anger.The host begins by showing footage of some of the racist violence spilling out at Trump rallies across the country. This includes the moment John Franklin McGraw of North Carolina sucker-punching a black protester and threatening to kill him (Trump later stated he would pay the attacker s legal bills, and those of anyone arrested for violence at his rallies).While Trump pinned the blame for violence on Bernie Sanders supporters, Bee showed footage of Trump fans telling bystanders to go to Auschwitz. Go to f**king Auschwitz.  Clearly, not a Sanders fan.But, Bee states, surely the millions of Trump supporters across the country can t be hysterical racists? There must be some sane, rational, people who are choosing to back Trump too. So she picked a sample and offered to put on a lavish party for them in exchange for an open conversation about their candidate and their views.It s actually more terrifying than the racist violence. What you see is smart, open-minded people  choking down their own souls to belong. Bee starts by asking the group how they feel about their candidates statements on banning muslims from the country. Temporarily!  they say, almost in unison.  For our national security. As if this somehow resolves the dilemma. They take no issue with lumping the world s 1.7 billion Muslims together as terrorists.However, when Bee asks them how they feel about white supremacists backing their candidate, they are up in arms at the lumping together of themselves with other Trump fans. One supporter doesn t even look remotely convinced of her own argument as she mumbles: We all love America, I guess. If there s something we can come together on, we want this country to be great, I think everyone can get behind that. Getting angry at the clear embarrassment this question has caused the group, one supporter strikes out with: It s clearly illogical to play the guilt-by-association game because we could do this all day long, To which Bee points out that they have no problem playing that game against Muslims.Silence.Bee moves on, asking the group how they feel about the racist violence breaking out at Trump rallies. They argue that the media is continuing to quote Trump out of context. So Bee plays the video of Trump inciting the crowd to attack a protester, stating that he would do it himself. She turns to the group and asks: Can you acknowledge that it is literally impossible, as a member of the media, to ignore a person when they say they would punch a protester in the face? One supporter dismisses the question out of hand, stating that if you get enough people in a space, somebody is always going to get punched in the face. Ok.Bee mingles around the the party, and chats to the woman who stated that Trump would bring America together. She tells Bee she really wants the wall, to keep out undesirables. When asked who will pay for it, the woman states with glee that Mexico will. Bee s fact checker points out that Mexico is on the record as stating they will not pay for the wall. To which the woman replies, wide-eyed: And you know what Trump said? The wall just got 10 feet taller! Her final chat at the party is with a man clearly on the verge of rage. Bee states that he is making her feel uncomfortable because although he is smiling, there is real anger in his eyes. With another burst of barely suppressed rage and pointing a finger in Bee s face, the man states: There s no anger, it s passion. Don t mistake that. Bee signs off with a resigned sigh that we have to withstand 8 months more of this  passion , while a rolling a montage of violence at Trump rallies.What is clear from the footage is that there s no way of holding a rational argument with a zealot. And what s clear from the Trump fan party is that he is encouraging zealotry, the unquestioning evangelism of Trump, in groups that might otherwise display all the signs of being critical thinkers and evidence-based voters. That is way if anything, this bizarre party is more terrifying than the hysterical scenes at the rallies   because these people know better, and they re choosing to be sucked into the dark world of Donald Trump anyway.

A recent study of nearly 40 hours of campaign footage by Politico found that The Donald lies on average every five minutes. go ahead and read that again and take it in for all it s worth: Donald Trump tells a bald-faced lie every five minutes he s at a podium.His followers eat it up. Whether he s inventing numbers about trade deficits, creating success stories that definitely never actually happened to him or defending his bankruptcies, out-of-court settlements and failed business ventures, Donald Trump truly personifies the old adage that you can tell if he s lying if his lips are moving. Politico stated:We chronicled 4.6 hours of stump speeches and press conferences, from a rally in Concord, N.C., on Monday to a rally on Friday in St. Louis.The result: more than five dozen statements deemed mischaracterizations, exaggerations, or simply false   the kind of stuff that would have been stripped from one of our stories, or made the whole thing worthy of the spike. It equates to roughly one misstatement every five minutes on average.They also produced a video of some of those lies   captioned with the truth   for your viewing pleasure:How anyone can take this buffoon seriously is a mystery. While most Republicans are well-known for blaming the problems they and their party created for our country on Democrats, specifically President Obama, Trump is content to lie when the truth goes better. For example, we have a $366 billion trade deficit with China, which Trump has repeatedly exaggerated to $500 billion. Is that extra $134 billion really that important? Most middle and working class Americans struggle to keep $1000 in the bank, Donald. $366 billion more than makes the point.Another fan favorite is the ever-benevolent Trump and his  self-funded  campaign. Trump has passed the $7 million mark on donations from people who hit the big blue  donate  button on his website, and the bulk of his  self-funding  comes in the form of a $17.5 million loan from Donald J Trump. That loan can be repaid anytime up until shortly after his campaign ends. Trump s actual personal contributions total a little over $200K.That s how good  Christians  like Donald Trump operate. They hide behind lies. The truth that they are corporate lackeys looking to better their personal portfolios and secure a future for old, white, male America isn t so easy to campaign on, so they conjure a truth that fits their dialogue. In Trump s case, the truth is far more frightening than most, if not all, Republicans who have come before him: He wants the presidency so he can enjoy the pinnacle of power and blow things up.Not exactly a good enough reason to hand a lunatic the nuclear football but hey, you can t blame a megalomaniac for trying.Featured image from Gage Skidmore""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They have reduced this extreme racism to inappropriate transmission on a police frequency  and released the following statement: The statements made are absolutely unacceptable and Superintendent [John] Escalante has ordered an immediate internal affairs investigation into this incident,  CPD officials said.  Should the investigation reveal that a member of the police department made the statements, he will be immediately suspended and disciplinary proceedings will be launched. Considering that it was over police dispatch, it is highly unlikely that anyone BUT a Chicago police officer or someone else who has access to that feed in such a position said it. Further, forget suspended   fire these people once they are identified. They obviously cannot police neighborhoods for people of color in a fair and unbiased way. Don t we have enough issues with police racism? Don t we have enough racist cops using their position to literally murder people of color? Shame on you, Chicago PD, if you allow these racists to keep their jobs. Then again, with the way things usually go in these cases, I won t be surprised if nobody is disciplined at all, let alone fired as they should be.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In what is becoming a trend, Trump once again used Christie as his personal punching bag, while the humiliated governor was forced to stand close by and grovel.At a campaign stop in Ohio, Trump took a dig at the state s governor John Kasich by noting that he was such a bad governor, that he may have even been worse than Christie. Christie was standing off to Trump s side, forced to pretend to like it as he was mocked by the man he endorsed for president. It was surreal. Your governor, Kasich, if you look at him, and I m being totally impartial,  he goes to New Hampshire, he s living in New Hampshire. Living. Where s Chris? Is Chris around? Even more than Chris Christie he was there. [Trump points at Chris, standing just off camera] Right?! Ouch. The dig is particularly bad because Christie has often been accused of abandoning his state to promote himself. But don t worry, Chris. Trump felt awfully bad about telling a crowd that you are terrible. I hated to do that,  Trump said with a smile,  but I had to make my point. The scorching by his new best friend comes at a very awkward time for Christie. The New Jersey governor has been getting hammered by critics in his state for abandoning his job to run a failed campaign for president and then immediately jump on the Trump bandwagon, and avoid his job again. Already, many are calling for Christie to resign or face impeachment.On the very same day that he was being shamed by Trump, Christie set off a firestorm of outrage when he announced he would be in Ohio rather than attend the funeral of a police officer who had been killed in the line of duty.Local media outlets reported that  hundreds of police officers, family members and friends  attended Cullen s funeral in Washington Township, N.J.Christie, however, was not one of them.Instead, the former 2016 White House hopeful hosted a town hall forum with Trump at noon on Monday, the same time Cullen s funeral was scheduled for, at Rhyne University in Hickory, N.C.He then joined Trump for his Ohio event.This isn t the first time Christie has had to stand with a grin while Trump brought him to heel in front of thousands of people and dozens of news cameras. Earlier this year, a hot mic captured Trump telling Christie to get off the stage they were sharing and get on the plane. The incident quickly went viral, confirming many of the rumors swirling about Trump s campaign and his obsession with not letting anyone share his spotlight.Why does Christie suffer through this level of disrespect? That s easy. His career as governor is doomed, and he s shooting for attorney general in Trump s administration.

But I believe that what impacts you impacts me, that we are all united in one way or another. When children go hungry, I get impacted. When kids die because they can t afford medicine, I get impacted. We are one world and one people. And that belief leads me to the conclusion that we just cannot turn our back on human suffering. Sanders  beliefs are found in both the Jewish faith. From the Talmud,  Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world. Alternatively, the same beliefs are found in the secular organized labor movement. In particular, the International Worker s Union s motto,  An injury to one is an injury to all,  encapsulates Sanders  belief system as he has described it.This is all happening against Trump s threats to Sanders and his supporters.

They didn t do it in self defense, but out of hatred and entitlement.Rallies in St. Louis and Chicago have nearly sparked race wars between white racists and protesters, and Trump has even led his supporters in a pledge that included the Nazi salute.Trump claims that his rallies are not violent and that no one has ever been injured at one of his events.So, it really comes as no surprise at all that a group of Trump supporters are actually forming a militia to beat up protesters who they claim are  Far-left agitators  and the real culprits committing violent acts.A group on Twitter called  Lion s Guard,  described themselves as  An informal civilian organization dedicated to protecting the safety and security of innocent, peaceful Trump supporters from violent Far-Left agitators. The group then tweeted out an invitation to other Trump supporters who would like to  forcefully protect  rallies and referred to themselves as the real victims of beatings and violence. Do you want to provide security protection to innocent people who are subject to harassment and assault by Far-left agitators? If so, you are welcome to join. That s the mission   to protect innocents who can t hire their own security guards. We are unarmed but willing to forcefully protect people if need be. We are *defensive*, *protective* of innocents who are being beaten and harassed for their political views. And then the page was taken down after the page owner received a threat, but they promised to create a website to coordinate actions the group takes.Here s a screenshot of the Twitter page via RT.Image via RTAgain, this group sounds like wannabe members of the Brownshirts who served Adolf Hitler during his rise to power in Germany, whose primary purpose was to provide protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies from those they deemed socialists and communists. At one such assembly in November 1919, Hitler s Brownshirt friends ejected hecklers by force by throwing them down the stairs. At another meeting in February 1920, dissenters who tried to shout Hitler down were violently removed. And in November 1921, a melee broke out when the Brownshirts attacked protesters during a Hitler speech.This is same kind of violence that is already occurring at Trump rallies across the country and now a group of his supporters are taking it a step further by creating a group dedicated to  forcefully  taking down protesters if a Trump supporter merely feels threatened.Trump has already been repeatedly labeled a fascist this month, and this new group only makes that label stick.

After this week saw nearly every Trump rally end in assaults and racial and ethnic slurs, the question turned from  Will someone be killed at a Trump rally?  to  When? Trump has done absolutely nothing to tone down the rhetoric. In fact, he s stepped it up. Lately, he s begun using his supporters as a personal goon squad. When he accused Bernie Sanders fans of forcing him to cancel his rally in Chicago, he threatened to  send them  out to harass Sanders supporters. The supporters themselves seem downright eager to oblige this call to violence. The only thing missing are literal brown shirts.This again came to a head, this time in North Carolina, where Trump rallies in Concord and Fayetteville. In one disturbing, but not uncommon, incident, a black man was attacked as the crowd roared. A cowboy hat-wearing Trump superfan beamed as he told reporters that he was proud for sucker punching an African American protester as he was being escorted out. He was eventually charged with assault, but not before vowing to  kill  the man if he ever saw him again.Trump doubled-down on his claim that these protesters were  bad people  and possibly ISIS terrorists. He then encouraged his followers to be more violent when faced with protesters, again saying they were  bad  and deserved it. His supporters in the media also parroted this call to violence.I would like to see a little more violence from the innocent Trump supporters set upon by violent leftist hoodlums.

And this isn t just a thought exercise. People have been repeatedly hurt trying to escape the events. One man was pushed down and kicked. Another was elbowed in the face. Even reporters have faced violence. A TIME photographer was choke-slammed by Trump s Secret Service agent. A former Breitbart reporter was thrown to the ground by Trump s campaign manager, leaving bruises on her arm from where he grabbed her. The list goes on When Trump comes to town, you can count on two things happening: The racists crawling out of the woodwork waving Trump flags and violence directed at the people who oppose Trump. That s not a way to run a democracy. If authorities don t begin to stand up to Trump s calls for violence with criminal charges, the chances of a deadly incident happening are nearly total.The authorities in North Carolina caution that they may not charge Trump, however. Unfortunately,  inciting a riot  is known in legal circles as being notoriously difficult to prove, given how vague its language is. Trump will no doubt respond with an army of lawyers to descend on North Carolina should he find himself charged, so it is clearly making the sheriff s office gun shy. In a statement, they said they were looking into but won t make an official decision until after they ve run down a few more leads.Featured image via WRAL""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

You want to live in this country, you better leave,  the man warned Usama and his friend, who is Hispanic.Usama stood up to the bully and told him,  This is my country; who are you to tell me that? That s when the white man became violent, according to the Wichita Eagle.The exchange was heated, Usama said, and he tried to defuse the situation, but his friend got punched and taken to the ground. He said he tried to get between the attacker and his friend but then was pushed himself. He thought he saw the attacker reaching for his pocket and feared he had a weapon, he said, so he backed away and called 911. He kept kicking the student who was laying on the ground,  Usama said.  He was kicking him; it was a gut-wrenching scene. He saw that I was calling the police and got back on his motorcycle and circled around us and was saying  Trump, Trump, Trump, we will make America great again. You losers will be thrown out of the wall. Usama says he didn t know the man who attacked him and his friend, but he also doesn t  know why anyone would do anything so hateful and so wrong to any individual. This isn t the first time a Trump supporter has physically assaulted a person of color, although many of the incidents usually occur at Trump rallies.In North Carolina last week, a white Trump supporter sucker-punched a black man being led out of the rally by security. At the same rally, another white Trump supporter slapped a back man and yelled obscenities at him.And Trump rallies in St. Louis and Chicago nearly turned into race wars as white supporters hurled obscenities, racial epithets, and threats of violence towards protesters. Some protesters were even assaulted. Yet Donald Trump claims no one has gotten hurt at his rallies and he has called for more violence.As for Usama, he urged others to speak up if they find themselves being verbally or physically assaulted. There may be other people who are fearing the same thing. So this is really important in the times we are in, the challenges we are facing as minorities in this country; we better get united and we better speak up. Make no mistake, Donald Trump and the Republican Party are responsible for these racists and their actions. His white supporters literally think they are entitled to be assholes toward minorities and Trump only makes them feel bulletproof and immune to prosecution because he has said he would pay for their legal defense if they get arrested for assault or hate crimes.If Trump becomes president, this is what his America will look like.

After a Department of Justice review found the former judge ran his court as a for-profit entity, squeezing fine after fine from a city held hostage to his abuse, the new judge made some radical changes that allowed an entire city to breathe a little easier.The judge removed all warrants and license suspensions for non-payment of fines from the previous year, solving several problems in one fell swoop. First, people could stop fearing that the police would pull them over or stop them on the street at random looking for a collar and a few more dollars for the city s coffers. Next, it allowed citizens to have a new day in court in front of a judge who wasn t there to stock the prison system with cheap labor and add fines to people who already couldn t pay. People lined up to pay their old fines if they could or make payment arrangements or ask that they are dismissed if they couldn t.The end result was a city that had been victimized by class warfare and institutional racism being given a new start. No longer would 70 percent of households have no right against illegal searches just because someone inside had a bench warrant for not paying a fine they couldn t afford. No longer would police be able to pull people over at random, almost certain to make their arrest quota by ruining the livelihoods of people forced to drive on suspended licenses or lose their jobs.Ferguson was a perpetual circle of hell for its residents when it came to the police and the court system. It was also the perfect place to start a movement to reform it. Now Justice Department civil rights prosecutor Vanita Gupta is taking the philosophy that s working so well in Ferguson and trying to spreads it nationwide. While the letter she wrote to state courts doesn t carry the full weight of the law, it does carry the seal of the United States Justice Department and the full support of the executive branch of the U.S. government.That letter, which is a stern warning to judges and clerks to be wary of tactics that target the poor and minorities, including setting bail amounts beyond reason for charges filed and using bench warrants as a way to make money.

His answer was surprising, but his reasoning is not: Bernie Sanders, no question,  said Edelman. ,  I think it s quite simple again. If you look at something called  velocity of money  That means how much gets spent and turns around. When you have the top one percent getting money, they spend five-ten percent of what they earn. When you have the lower end of the economy getting money, they spend a hundred, or a hundred and ten percent of what they earn. As you ve had a transfer of wealth to the top, and a transfer of income to the top, you have a shrinking consumer base, basically, and you have a shrinking velocity of money. Edelman argued redistributing wealth, especially at the point we are at now with levels of income and wealth inequalities continually growing, is what is best for the economy. Greed and corruption may allow the wealthiest to gain short term profits, but as the middle class disappears and the working class becomes ever burdened, the economy begins to sputter into stagnation.Senator Bernie Sanders  economic policies aren t radical, socialist, or unrealistic. They are simply what is needed to be implemented to fix a broken, rigged economy.

This week, his 30-year sentence has been thrown out by the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Virginia.Nicholas Ragin has waited a long time for justice. When he was first indicted in 2004, like so many Americans caught up in the justice system, he could not afford a lawyer to defend himself against the charges. Instead, he was appointed a public defender named Nikita V. Mackey.These were serious charges. Ragin and several others stood accused to running a prostitution ring in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was alleged that girls as young as 14 were being pimped out for $200 a night. Six women testified to being trapped in the service of Ragin and his alleged accomplices. This case demonstrated how devastating prostitution, drug trafficking and gun toting can be for the Charlotte community,  U.S. Attorney Gretchen Shappert said in a written statement.  The victims were preyed upon by individuals with no regard for their dignity. It took until 2006 for the case to go to trial, and all four of the accused were sentence to a mandatory 10 year sentence with the possibility of life behind bars.However, we would never know if the conviction was sound, due to the appalling behavior of Ragin s court-appointed attorney. Judge Roger Gregory of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that Ragin s conviction for conspiracy and racketeering can be overturned, as he did not receive the defense he is due under the U.S. constitution. In his written decision, the Judge stated: We hold that a defendant is deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when counsel sleeps during a substantial portion of the defendant s trial. Nicholas Ragin s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated not because of specific legal errors or omissions indicating incompetence in counsel s representation but because Ragin effectively had no legal assistance during a substantial portion of his trial, Attorney Peter Adolf testified at the appeal that during Ragin s trial, the Judge: leaned into his microphone, because we were all sitting there and (Mackey) wasn t moving and said,  Mr. Mackey  . . . very loudly. Mackey then jumped up and sort of looked around and was licking his lips and moving his mouth and looked sort of confused and looked all over the room,  .Despite this clear ineffective assistance of counsel, Ragin s trial proceeded to conviction, without the Judge or any other authority stepping in to uphold due process.What s worse, is that Mackey has form. According to the New York Daily News:He resigned from Charlotte Police Department after 14 years as a cop when facing accusations that he falsified time sheets.Remarkably, four years later Mackey was elected as sheriff for the same police department, but the state quickly overturned it after a local news investigation uncovered questionable voting tactics.Mackey has bungled other legal cases, too, like when he failed to appear in court for two separate trials in 2007 and 2008 and once caused a client s adoption to fall through because he failed to communicate with them about the legal process.His job performance shortcomings aside, he was elected in 2008 as a North Carolina state representative and served two years in office.In 2010, the North Carolina bar suspended his license for three years for failing to pay taxes, despite his LinkedIn page saying he is a tax attorney.And so, Ragin s conviction has been overturned. Either an innocent man has spent 10 years in jail for a crime he did not commit, or a guilty man has been freed. Either way, the justice system has failed, catastrophically. And not just this once.As John Oliver highlighted during a 2015 episode of  Last Week Tonight , even a gifted and determined public defender is unlikely to be able to offer up any kind of decent defense due to the hideous working conditions placed upon them. Many are being loaded up with 1,000 cases per year   that s three cases per day: With caseloads that heavy, public defenders cannot possibly prepare an effective defense,  Oliver said. A study in New Orleans, a few years back, found the city had some part-time defenders who could only spend an average of seven minutes per case. And that is not long enough to prepare anything. If I only had seven minutes to prepare this show, I would definitely not be talking about public defenders right now. I d be desperately trying to fill time right now by listing the Muppets in order of f*ckability. Those familiar with the Adnan Syed case made famous by Serial and later, the Undisclosed Podcast, will be familiar with the issues around ineffective assistance of counsel, and the devastating impact it can have on whole communities. Syed has spent 17 years in jail for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, in a case founded on so many inaccuracies and prejudices that it simply beggars belief that he was in jail longer than a day.The issue of whether we think a person is innocent or guilty of the crime is secondary to the issue of our justice system failing to deliver effective trials. Particularly to people who cannot afford to pay for their own defense. Without that guarantee, we do not have a justice system. We have a justice system for the rich, where the accused is presumed innocent until or unless they are found guilty. For everyone else, we have plea bargaining system   where guilt is presumed, and it is simply a matter of negotiating the penalty. Not only does this strip people of their freedom, but in many states, their right to vote.While this situation is allowed to continue, the U.S. Justice system will continue to lag behind the rest of the developed world   and Americans will continue to be denied justice.Featured Image via Mecklenburg County""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Virginia Supreme Court decision in 1967 effectively made interracial marriage legal, and forbade discrimination on the grounds of disagreement and bigotry against such marriages. This is the year 2016, so you d think this would be an issue that is in the dustbins of history at this point, right? Wrong. Kentucky is taking us all back to the dark days of legalized segregation and racial discrimination, as their state legislature is currently advancing a bill that would legalize discrimination against interracial couples. The bill, called SB 180, says in part: Protected activities  means actions by people commissioned, employed, hired, retained, or otherwise used by the public or the government to provide customized, artistic, expressive, creative, ministerial, or spiritual goods or services, or judgments, attestations, or other commissions that involve protected rights;  Protected activity provider  means a person who provides protected activities; and  Protected rights  means the rights of persons to be free from governmental actions that impair, impede, infringe upon, or otherwise restrict the exercise of any right guaranteed by the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Kentucky, including but not limited to a person s right of conscience, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and right to peaceable assembly.So in other words, if your boss is a racist and finds out your spouse is of a different race from you, he can fire you. The bill is obviously aimed LGBT people, but it is so broadly worded that at this point, it could mean literally anything   including and especially related to interracial dating and marriage. The worst part of it all is that these people can hide behind  religious beliefs  to discriminate, and there is no provision in the bill for legal recourse on the part of the victims of this discrimination.And if you think this won t happen, think again. There are still PLENTY of people who oppose  race mixing  and anything they perceive to be against the bible in that arena. This will truly turn back the clock on civil rights like we ve never seen before if this horrendous bill becomes law.Featured image via Wikipedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In other words, if a judge rules a law passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature unconstitutional, Republicans would legally have the power to then impeach that judge and replace him or her with a judge who will rule the way Republicans want them to rule.Governor Sam Brownback and his Republican cohorts in the statehouse have had their schemes to defund public schools foiled by the state Supreme Court in recent years after the GOP tried to use the funds to pay for a disastrous budget shortfall created when Brownback gave rich people a massive tax cut.So far, the state Supreme Court has blocked such a move as unconstitutional since the Kansas Constitution plainly states that the  legislature shall provide for intellectual, educational, vocational and scientific improvement by establishing and maintaining public schools, educational institutions and related activities which may be organized and changed in such manner as may be provided by law. Furthermore, the Kansas Constitution says the  legislature shall make suitable provision for finance of the educational interests of the state. That means the Kansas Supreme Court has made the right call by denying Brownback and Republicans the ability to screw over the public school system to benefit the wealthy.But if Republicans pass this bill into law, they would be able to overthrow the judicial branch so they can pass whatever laws they want even if they are unconstitutional. They would be effectively rigging the court in their favor.And Kansas Republicans haven t exactly made this a secret.The Star reports:Impeachment has  been a little-used tool  to challenge judges who strike down new legislation, said Republican Sen. Dennis Pyle, a sponsor of the measure.  Maybe it needs to be oiled up a little bit or sharpened a little bit. Courts have the ability to harm society with their decisions,  GOP state Senator Mitch Holmes claimed in defense of the bill according to the Topeka Capitol Journal.  And impeachment was what our founders intended to be a check and a balance on an unchecked system, or what has evolved into an unchecked system. But once again, Republicans are wrong. Not only is their bill unconstitutional on the grounds that the state constitution does not list disagreement as a legitimate reason for impeachment, it would make the court system a puppet institution with the sole purpose of allowing Republicans to do whatever they want in the legislative and executive branches without a judicial branch that can check their power. Basically, it is the executive and legislative branches that would become an  unchecked system. Article 2 of the state constitution clearly states grounds for impeachment.The governor and all other officers under this constitution, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.So unless Republicans want to literally make disagreeing with them a crime, which would violate the First Amendment and the independence of the judiciary, they would be well-advised to trash this bill and never let it see the light of day again.This is the exact kind of government overreach that Republicans have hypocritically whined about for decades, and yet here they are trying to overthrow the state Supreme Court so that Brownback can stack it with judges who will do his bidding. Just imagine if this scheme actually worked. How long would it be before Republicans try the exact same thing at the federal level so that they can keep the court conservative forever? This is serious power play that needs to be squashed by the people of Kansas before they no longer have a fair court system to rely on.

Donald Trump is running a cynical campaign of hate and fear, for one reason: to get votes,  she said.  He s encouraging violence and chaos to get votes. He is pitting Americans against each other to get votes. As the Washington Post reports, Clinton s comments mark a  sharp escalation  in the tone of the former Secretary of State s about Trump. And she wasn t done there. After stoking every fire he can think of, Trump encourages his supporters to beat up anybody who disagrees with him   literally punch them in the face   and then offers to pay their legal bills,  Clinton said.In 2012 when President Obama successfully ran for re-election in an atmosphere of right-wing demagoguery, he often told audiences who booed at the prospect of Mitt Romney becoming president,  don t boo, vote.  Clinton offered her version of the phrase in her speech: You and I know Donald Trump is not who we are,  she said.  Of course, we can criticize and protest Mr. Trump all we want. But none of that matters if we also don t show up at the polls. She added:  If you want to shut him down, then let s vote him down. Some observers have worried that Democrats are not turning out to vote in the primaries in the same numbers as Republicans have been, and wondered if that will spill over to the general election, where Democrats have historically had a slight edge in turnout over the Republicans. But Trump s comments and overall campaign tone seem to have energized the core Democratic voters   women and minorities   needed to take the party s nominee to victory.Coupled with recent, direct denunciations of Trump s harmful rhetoric from Bernie Sanders as well, the left seems  fired up and ready to go.

Governor Dayton reduced the deficit and increased tax revenue by taxing individuals who made more than $150,000 two percent more, from 7.85 percent in state income tax to 9.85 percent, or over $2 billion in extra revenue for the state annually. He also increased the minimum wage and passed an equal pay for women law, despite conservatives in the state criticizing him for these efforts.The result was the creation of over 170,000 new jobs to Minnesota s economy, which now has one of the highest employment rates in the country. The median income in the state is also $8,000 more than the national average. That multi-billion dollar budget deficit he inherited is also now a $1 billion surplus.In contrast, during the same time Wisconsin s Republican Governor Scott Walker broadened poverty levels to the highest they have been in decades by decreasing taxes on the wealthy. Trickle down economics is a myth perpetuated by Republicans that continues to damage our economy and increase poverty.

America is pretty darn great right now,  Obama thundered in Dallas in a direct rebuke of Trump s campaign claim that American has somehow gotten worse over the last eight years. America is making strides right now! America is better off than it was right now! The American people should be proud of what we have achieved together in the last eight years since the recession hit. We are great right now. Obama then went after Trump and the other GOP candidates for turning the election into a childish circus where lies reign over facts and violence against other Americans is encouraged, something that has led to multiple clashes between Trump supporters and protesters. What the folks who are running for office should be focused on is how we can make it even better   not insults and schoolyard taunts and manufacturing facts, not divisiveness along the lines of race and faith. Certainly not violence against other Americans or excluding them. We re a better country than that. Here s the video via YouTube.But President Obama was not done yet. As the crowd laughed, Obama turned Trump and his multiple business scams into a punchline. Imagine what Trump would say if he actually had a record like this instead of selling steaks,  Obama quipped. Has anybody bought that wine?  Obama asked the audience.  I want to know what that wine tastes like. I mean, come on, you know that s like some $5 wine. They slap a label on it, they charge you $50, saying this is the greatest wine ever. Come on! And then President Obama lambasted Republicans for saying how shocked they are over Trump s racist rhetoric, reminding them that their front-runner is the same guy who would not drop his obsession with Obama s birth certificate. Republicans didn t say anything then, Obama pointed out, because Trump s rhetoric was not aimed at the GOP like it is now.Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, the Republican Party and Fox News built the monster that is now taking over the party and invited white supremacists to take a prominent seat next to him.Trump s status as front-runner should be the end of the Republican Party as a legitimate political organization, but it appears Trump is merely replacing it with a fascist organization that will be even worse. In their desperation to oppose President Obama at every turn using hate and fear to gin up opposition and extremism, Republicans created the atmosphere for someone like Trump to rise and thrive and now they are paying the price for it.

Divide and conquer. It s a strategy that has been used since the beginning of time as the wealthy elites, knowing they are few in numbers, but large in political sway, can manipulate a populace to their liking so that they remain in power. It s a strategy still being used to this very day, and can be seen in full swing within the Donald Trump campaign.Donald Trump has been using this us vs. them strategy since the start of his campaign. He s made a group of working and middle class blue-collar folks think that the problems in this nation stem from  the other.  The people who aren t just like them. That if those people weren t around, all of their problems would disappear. It s a mind game played by the wealthy and powerful to make groups of people do their bidding for them.This strategy is especially successful when dealing with a group of people who somehow sees themselves as better than another group. And in the video you re about to watch below, author and activist Tim Wise explains this strategy perfectly. He points out that this has been a strategy used on working class whites, especially in the South for as long as one could possibly remember. The wealthy purchased black slaves, stopped hiring the poor working class white workers because they would need to get paid, and then blamed the problems of the poor working class white workers, including lack of jobs or income, on the black slaves. However, whose fault is it? Certainly not the slaves. However, this skillful manipulation to make it so black slaves would get blamed got the poor working class whites to utterly despise black people. It got them to join militias to suppress slave insurrections. It was the ultimate scam. Divide and conquer. Wise also explains that the Civil War was about states rights, sure, the rights for individuals in states to own slaves.Trump is using this same strategy blaming Mexicans and Muslims to rile up a base of poorly educated working class white folks who really just don t know any better. They ve had a rough go in life and Trump is successfully shifting blame from those on top who manipulate the system to  the other  yet again. He s giving these working class angry white people a reason to feel superior even though they are totally being manipulated. It gives them a sense of power and entitlement that is, in all honesty, a ruse.It s the ultimate in white privilege. When you can get people to believe that they are superior and deserve better and more just for being white, and if something is bad, blame the people who aren t white, or aren t Christian, or aren t heterosexual, or aren t Republican.Tim Wise, even recently, posted about how Donald Trump his encouraging hatred. He said in a Facebook post, regarding a story of a man who killed three people for not speaking English: This is the fault of nativist bigots like Donald Trump, encouraging hatred for anyone seen as insufficiently  American  (even someone who, as with one of these victims, was Puerto Rican and thus an American citizen   something probably neither the killer here nor Trump knows). This is the kind of America we re in store for, on a much larger level, if the Trump movement is not defeated resoundingly Quite honestly, you can watch this video ten times in a row and still want to watch it again. Wise hits the nail on the head.

As Reich points out in the video, both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush cut taxes on the rich, and  nothing trickled down. The result of Republican tax cuts for the rich have been the same across the states. GOP governors like Bobby Jindal and Rick Snyder have driven their states into economic ruin by imposing experimental trickle-down economic policies on citizens, with disastrous results.Along the same lines, Republicans claim that high taxes on the rich are bad for the economy. Yet history shows the opposite is true.Until 1980, taxes on the top earners in the U.S. were 70 percent. It wasn t until Republicans started cutting these tax rates that economic growth began to slow.Reich also tackles the myth that shrinking government creates jobs. The idea that we create jobs by firing people who already have jobs literally defies reason, but that hasn t stopped republicans from pushing it. It doesn t take much to destroy this lie.While republicans were remarkably silent about the national deficit while George Bush was in the White House, it suddenly became earth-shatteringly important on the day President Obama took office.Reich destroys the myth of deficit reduction as a top priority, explaining that the goal is to reduce the debt as a percent of the GDP, something that cannot be accomplished by slashing budgets all over the place.Reich also looks at how the rising cost of health care impacts the budget, busting the GOP myth that programs like Medicare and Medicaid are negatively impacting the economy.What s important to understand in relation to the health care debate is that government programs actually help slow the increase in health care costs for everyone.The right has been attacking social security as a  Ponzi scheme  ever since they figured out that there was a lot of money in the social security fund that they couldn t get their greedy little hands on.Is this true? Of course it s not. As Reich explains in the video, Social security is solvent for the next two-plus decades, and it would solvent for much longer if we lift the income cap.The video would not be complete if it didn t address the lie that lower-income people not paying taxes is horribly unfair to the rich.Watch the video below, courtesy of MoveOn on YouTube: While the video above was released in 2011, Republicans are still using these same debunked economic myths to press their disastrous agenda all across the country.As long as Republicans continue to try to repackage and sell these same old lies at election time, we ll be forced to keep debunking their myths time and time again.Image credit: wikimedia commons, video screen capture via MoveOn ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

A Trump supporter just asked me at Reno event if I was taking pictures for ISIS. When I looked shocked, he said,  yeah, I m talking to you.  Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) January 10, 2016He went on to describe the encounter in more detail, writing on Twitter,The man then repeated the accusation multiple times.

I have a couple of guesses what he meant by that,  Deb said on Twitter.He says that during a different rally, held in December, another Trump supporter told him to  Go back to Iraq. It should come as no surprise to anyone to learn that Trump s rallies are a magnet for the lowest common denominator. If there is any sort of diversity among Trump s supporters, it s only in the slight difference between proud white supremacists with swastika tattoos, and semi-closeted racists, who prefer to hide behind crosses while crying that their  traditional Christian values  are under attack. Politically speaking, however, there s very little difference between the Tea Party platform, the platform of the American Nazi Party, that of the KKK or any other white supremacist organization.As the Washington Post reported here, membership in white supremacist groups grew at an enormous rate after the election of President Obama in 2008. There were 194 such groups in 2000, a number that dropped to 149 by 2008, but after President Obama s election, the number jumped to more than 1,000 Trump has capitalized on the right wing s seething race hatred, and in doing so, he s been propelled to the head of race.Knowing that, it s no surprise that the candidate has refused to condemn the KKK, or that white nationalists have been robocalling voters on behalf of his campaign.In 2016, voters will decide which direction our country will move in. Should Donald Trump, or any other right-wing racist win the presidency, racial tensions are likely to explode across the country.Now s the time to keep our country moving forward, challenging racism and right-wing extremism at every turn.

Not to sound too conspiratorial, but it almost as if his campaigned planned this. Chicago is a bastion of leftist radical organizing. It would have been shocking if there hadn t been a massive demonstration at the campaign event.His campaign staff made the conscious decision to hold an event at the University of Illinois at Chicago. A racially diverse University with a politically active student body and a heavy Black Lives Matter activist presence. Now, Trump is using the rally as a justification for his supporters to go to Bernie Sanders  rallies to protest Sanders. Trump is also once again enjoying having total domination of the media s focus.Now, Trump isn t an idiot. He is, however,  a master manipulator. He knows that his rights were not violated. He is only using this narrative to further crystallize his followers support and lionize them to take bolder actions against his opponents.

The billionaire, who has made headlines for tweeting out white supremacist propaganda and for gaining the unwavering support of racists across the nation, repeatedly says the things that many conservatives wish they could say without getting kicked out of a restaurant or losing their jobs   Muslims should not be allowed to enter the country, Mexicans are all rapists, beating up black people is perfectly fine as long as it s done in his name (he ll even pay the legal fees for anyone who does it).In January, an analysis of Trump s Twitter traffic revealed that not only were 68 percent of the people he retweeted the week of January 26 white supremacists, but that 58% of the top 50 white supremacist Twitter accounts follow Trump   figures even The Donald s most die-hard detractors likely did  Nazi  coming. White supremacist groups campaign for Trump fairly regularly, so it is unsusprising that many Nazis feel quite at home at his rallies especially since Trump recently worked the good ole  Sieg Heil  into his events in the form of a f*cked-up loyalty pledge.On Saturday, video surfaced of Trump s supporters doing what they do best. The footage, apparently shot as Trump fans were leaving the event and were full of Trumpitude, shows numerous supporters tossing up the Nazi salute that has almost become a symbol for the 2016 hopeful.One man, wearing a backward baseball cap and a New York Yankees t-shirt, took things a goose-step father than a simple salute, though.If you can identify this man, please message me via any of the methods of contact in my bio.  JohnThe unidentified man told a Dutch reporter and protesters:Other supporters followed up with their own Hitler salutes, and all the while the crowd chanted,  Trump, Trump, Trump. While, surely, these individuals simply want to  make America great again,  one must question why they feel it necessary to emulate one of history s most horrible dictators while doing so.These supporters aren t the first, nor will they be the last, to  Sieg Heil  for The Donald as they scream for black people to  Go back to Africa. Recently, a 69-year-old woman in a Trump t-shirt was photographed tossing up her own Nazi salute, though she says she was simply showing protesters how to perfom the action properly. She s totally not a Nazi. Neither are the folks who tossed up their own salute as they screamed for people to be thrown into concentration camps.They just love America. Right?

Depp didn t mince his words as he railed against the GOPer, calling him a  brat.  Depp began by stating that he didn t think the candidate s offensive behavior was merely a result of  him being a rich kid.  Depp added,  There s something creative about him in a sense of bullydom  before ultimately coming to the conclusion that  What he is, I believe, is a brat. Depp also commented on Trump s raunchy, brash language by stating how interesting it was to follow the absurdity of where his sentences might travel.  Depp continued: Reagan back in the day,  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall!  Donald Trump,  I m going to build a wall. And all of my billions are not going to have to pay for it.

Last month, Depp impersonated the business mogul in a hilarious Funny Or Die video that was based on Trump s bestselling book The Art of the Deal.Depp is just the latest person to join the droves of celebrities speaking out against Trump. Just this weekend, singer John Legend also publicly railed against the Republican front runner when he called Trump out on Twitter. Trump has also recently been condemned by Louis C.K., Miley Cyrus, George Clooney, and Stephen King  and we don t blame these celebrities for doing everything they can to wake Americans up.

It is a difficult term, and the word  neo  has a lot to do with it   meaning a new kind of fascist in our culture, dealing with an authoritarian demagogic point of view,  Bernstein began. Nativist, racist, anti-immigrant bigotry that he appeals to. I think we need to look to the past  and I m not talking about Hitlerism and genocide. I m not drawing a direct paralel to Mussolini.But it is a kind of American fascism we haven t seen before. This goes beyond George Wallace, who was merely a racist. This goes to authoritarianism and the desire for a strong man who doesn t trust the institutions and democracy and government. Bernstein then slammed the media for not examining Trump and fascism more closely during this campaign. We now need on cable news to have a debate, a historical debate on what fascism was and is and how Donald Trump fits in the picture. Because it is something very foreign to our political cutltue in terms of the 20th, 21st century. That s going on in print and online but it is not part of our debate on cable. No interviewer as far as I know has asked Donald Trump, what is fascism, Mr. Trump, how are you different from the fascist message? When asked to confirm that he is calling Trump a neo-fascist, Bernstein responded in the affirmative, pointing out that Trump incites violence at his rallies and uses a methodology similar to ones used by fascist leaders of the past, which includes nativism. Berstein also stressed that up to now he had never used the term to  describe a living American politician. Here s the video via YouTube.Bernstein isn t the first to point out that Donald Trump is acting an awful lot like a fascist.The Daily Show with Trevor Noah also perfectly demonstrated how Trump is a fascist.Fascism is  a cult of action, celebrating aggressive masculinity, fear of outsiders, intense nationalism, intolerance of criticism, and resentment of national humiliation  Noah and the Daily Show team discovered.  I m shitting myself,  Noah remarked.  It all lines up so perfectly, doesn t it? It almost stops being funny as you re watching it. And even actor George Clooney called Trump a fascist during an interview with The Guardian earlier this month.And quite frankly, Bernstein, Noah, and Clooney are all correct when they say Donald Trump is a fascist. For months, Trump has viciously attacked immigrants and journalists while bragging about his masculinity and how America needs to be a bully in the world. He has also adopted anti-women rhetoric and even managed to lead his supporters into pledging themselves to him with a Nazi salute that looked eerily like something out of Nazi Germany.Make no mistake, Trump is scary and he is only becoming more frightening as he moves closer to winning the Republican nomination. We could, indeed, be watching the first fascist rise to national power in the United States. Don t believe me? Just click here.And if you need any more proof, consider this. Earlier this month, a Holocaust survivor spoke up and said Trump reminded him a lot of Adolf Hitler. If that doesn t make you believe Trump is a fascist who seriously threatens our nation, nothing will. Featured image via Twitter""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

For a start, we should take Mr. Trump s words with a grain of salt,  Sanders told the show s host, Jake Tapper.  Because I think almost everybody knows, this man cannot stop lying about anything. To call me a communist is a lie. To talk about our organization, our campaign, disrupting his meeting is a lie. As I have previously pointed out, Trump decided to cancel his rally in Chicago. It was an event open to the public. The public showed up and Trump could not handle that. As Sanders notes, Trump s Republican primary rivals have even pointed out that Trump got what he was asking for. Even his Republican colleagues make this point,  Sanders went on to say.  His language, his intonations, when you talk about carrying people out in stretchers, you see at his rallies people sucker-punched, folks kick people when they re down. This is a man who keeps implying violence, and then you end up getting what you see. Sanders is drawing on a comment made by Marco Rubio, who said: I know people like it that Donald Trump says whatever he wants and whatever they feel like saying. Presidents cannot say anything they want. Presidents have to understand that their words have consequences, often life and death consequences, for real people in the real world. Then there is the fact that Trump has frequently encouraged his followers to inflict violence against those who protest his events. With the media focused on Chicago last Friday, many people didn t see the chaos Trump s supporters unleashed in St Louis earlier that day. I think that he, in fact, has got to tell his supporters that in the United States of America we don t go beating up people, that people have a right to peacefully protest, and I hope that becomes the tone of his campaign.

He also accused Bernie Sanders of sending his supporters to disrupt the rallies and claimed that he hasn t incited violence at all even though he has been caught on tape doing exactly that.When Tapper tried to convince Trump to be a real leader and stop inciting violence, Trump became snippy.TAPPER:  People are getting hurt and people are actually concerned that somebody might get seriously, seriously injured. You are not taking down the temperature. You are, in the views of many of your fellow Republicans, making things worse, inciting, encouraging violence. And you re a leader, sir. You re the front-runner in the Republican Party. TRUMP:  Excuse me, excuse me! My fellow Republicans are running against me, they are losing bigly. The Donald then proceeded to lose his temper by nastily attacking his opponents and accusing Tapper of not covering his campaign rallies truthfully, yelling over Tapper and interrupting him while bashing CNN and claiming that  zero  people have been injured at his rallies.When Tapper could actually get a word in, he once again asked Trump to dial back his rhetoric for the sake of the country. Trump responded that Tapper should be more accurate in his reporting.TAPPER:  I would just ask as a fellow American if you could consider whether or not dialing down the temperature, might be a healthier thing, both for your campaign and for the nation the nation at large. TRUMP:  Well, you should report it right because we ve had no injuries at my events. So, you know, do what you have to do. Here s the video via YouTube.Clearly, Trump is lying when he says nobody has been injured at his rallies. There are countless videos of protesters being roughed up or flat-out assaulted by his supporters as Trump eggs them on. As we get closer and closer to the nomination, Trump has become more and more dangerous as his rallies have basically become full-blown Klan and neo-Nazi rallies where white racists feel right at home.

Asked how he would respond if Apple (or any other telecommunications company) ever declines a request to hack a phone on behalf of law enforcement agencies, Judd gave an angry response: I can tell you, the first time we do have trouble getting into a cellphone, we re going to seek a court order from Apple.

Apple has stated that if they were to comply with the request of law enforcement, they would be creating a master key that would unlock any iPhone. Once created, this masterkey could then be used for nefarious reasons by law enforcement, government, criminal and terrorist organizations around the world.In an attempt to bully Apple into surrendering the privacy rights of their customers, senior officers in law enforcement, the security services, and even government, are applying pressure to Apple as a company, and the CEO Tim Cook personally.

Earlier this week on  The Joyce Kaufman Show,  Rep. Louie Gohmert criticized President Obama and his Jewish supporters over a Wall Street Journal report about the administration s approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, dismissing the president s Jewish allies as self-hating.The Texas Republican said of Obama:  He s never been able to stand Israel. He s never been able to get along with people who actually stood for Israel. Now he gets along fine with the Israel-haters,  he continued.  But, and it breaks my heart, but there are some children of Israel who just apparently seem to be self-loathing when it comes to Israel   but yeah, those folks he gets along with fine. I have repeatedly anointed myself The World s Jew. I eat bacon. I celebrate Christmas. I mix meat and dairy. I literally only know Passover is coming when the supermarket puts matzoh bread on sale. Yet, the idea that I am a self-loathing Jew because I don t support the murderous right wing regime turning Israel in a full-fledged apartheid state is deeply offense. It s even more offensive coming from a person pretending not to hate Jews in the first place.The conflation of  Israel  and  Jew  is a deliberate and calculated move to shield Israel from criticism by leveling accusations of Antisemitism. But that doesn t exactly work on the millions of Jews like me around the world that are appalled at the violence and hatred perpetrated by Israel s government. So people try to label us self-loathing Jews.But I say that the only Jews who truly despise themselves are the ones that are rushing to embrace the same genocidal rage that brought us the Holocaust.In the meantime, Louie Gohmert can choke on a matzoh ball.Featured image by Gage Skidmore.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

During a segment on Fox Business Network, Ben & Jerry s co-founder, Ben Cohen, was questioned about the matter. Cohen responded appropriately by laughing at the show s host Neil Cavuto.Mentioning that Trump has accused Sanders of being behind the protest, he Cavuto asks Cohen  What do you make of it that there were many Sanders protesters there? Cohen responds, saying: I got no idea who was there. But I can tell you that Donald Trump brings out a lot of strong feelings. And I believe a fairly significant majority of Americans do not agree with Donald Trump and are embarrassed by the way he is conducting himself and . Cohen is then interrupted by Cavuto, who says: Well that s your opinion and you re entitled to it. Cavuto, bizarrely, then brings up the time that Sanders  rally was interrupted by Black Lives Matter activists. Cavuto s attempt to equivocate the two protests is rather weak. When Sanders was interrupted, he let the two courageous young women who interrupted him, take the podium. That showed Sanders has the one of the most important qualities of a great leader   the wisdom to know when to listen.Trump and his supporters, on the other hand, have an entirely different attitude towards those who disagree with them. Cohen responds to the Cavuto, saying: Well, there are two different ways of handling protesters. I mean there has always been protesters, there has always been people who are trying to disrupt political speeches, but going and telling people to rough them up, beat them up   it s not American, it s not what I want to see in my country. Conservatives are so desperate to put this conspiracy out there, they are willing to completely destroy a woman s reputation by spreading a rumor so ridiculous it shouldn t even need a Snopes article to bust it.Yes, there were Sanders  supporters at the rally that night. They were involved in one of the greatest protests in history. They did not, however, shut the rally down. Trump choose to end the event. Those Sanders supporters were also a very small group of people among thousands of activists who came to together to show Trump that he cannot just roll into any community and subject them to his vitriol without dissent.Chicago is a bastion of radical leftist resistance organizing. I would personally have been surprised if the campaign hadn t seen the type of protest that took place on Friday. This was going to happen no matter what other candidates are running.It should be noted that while Cohen s commentary on the protest is sound, he does seem to imply in the interview that Trump and Sanders might have a lot of common ground on issues. This shouldn t in any way be interpreted to think that a Trump presidency wouldn t be disastrous. Trump and Sanders may have some overlap in their observations of problems facing this nation though their policy prescriptions are as different as night and day. Come election day in November,  people need to accept that any candidate would be better than Trump.You can watch the Fox News segment below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KOIkPoOZWwFeatured image from video screenshot via YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The triple homicide shows where the politics of hate will lead America.Three people were slaughtered in horrifying circumstances this week, because their white neighbor was enraged by their ethnic origin and grasp of the English language. The terrifying scenes unfolded at a four unit apartment complex. One unit was occupied by Dan J Popp, one by the Manso-Perez family, and one by Phia Vue, his wife Mai, and their four children.The Journel-Sentinel reports that 40-year-old Jesus R. Manso-Perez and his son passed the apartment of their 39-year-old neighbor Dan J. Popp on their way to the basement laundry room. Popp invited them into his home with the offer of a neigborly beer, which they declined. Popp then cut short the niceties and got straight to his point, asking the pair where they were from. At their response, he reportedly said: Oh, that s why you don t speak English. You re Puerto Rican. The father and son bid their goodbyes and went on to do their laundry. However, when they made their way back up to their apartment, Popp was waiting for them on the stairs, rifle in hand. You guys got to go,  Popp said, according to police, before shooting Jesus in the head, killing him. He then fired at his son, but missed.Hearing the gunshots, Phia and Mai K. Vue hid in the bedroom with their four children and a 25-year-old relative who had been watching the children that day. The couple had just returned home from a day trip. When Popp began hammering at their door, they called the police and stayed in their hiding places. But Popp kicked down their door and searched the home until he found them. He demanded 36-year-old Phia leave the room, took him into the bathroom and shot him dead. Then he returned for Mai, dragging her and two young daughters out of the apartment while the rest of the family ran out in front and around them.The couple s young son was first to reach the police and told them: He shot my father; he s in the bathroom. A further shot then rang out from the apartment complex as Popp shot and killed 32-year-old Mai.Popp then surrendered himself to police. He has no previous criminal record, and is detained on bail of $150,000, while mental health assessments are completed.The explosion of violence is however, the terrifying end game of the ever escalating racist rhetoric and violence we are seeing in the current political climate. The very worst elements of white America are being unleashed. The bitter hatred of difference, the idea that non-European immigrants to the United States are the root of all evil and that everything wrong with the nation can be traced back to those groups.There is very good reason why, at home and abroad, the rise of the racist right in modern America is being compared to the rise of Adolf Hitler in 1930 s Germany. That reason is simple: the comparison is accurate.Depressed wages, a perceived crisis of masculinity, the demand for a  tough  leader who would drive through his agenda as an authoritarian, an obsession with a perceived dent to national pride which must be remedied with a show of economic and military force at home and abroad   and pure, unadulterated racism.When you unleash this level of anger at a scapegoat, people set out to hurt and kill that scapegoat.This is the vision of America that the racist right represents. And it is a vision of hell.The victory of such forces would be a disaster for America as a nation, but also for the international community in which she sits. This is not some television show where we sit back and watch the fall-out from the safety of our couch. This is real life. The racist right is a real and present danger, and it must be confronted with relentless and unwavering opposition by everyone who has a stake in a progressive, free, and hopeful America.Featured image via Gawker""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Sander then said,  While I appreciate that we had supporters at Trump s rally in Chicago, our campaign did not organize the protests. That is a most likely a reference to video taken inside the rally showing loud cheers for  Bernie!  after it was announced that the Trump rally would be canceled (a decision, by the way, that Trump claimed came from police but which they denied).The statement continues,  What caused the protests at Trump s rally is a candidate that has promoted hatred and division against Latinos, Muslims, women, and people with disabilities, and his birther attacks against the legitimacy of President Obama. Sanders previously referenced those same birther attacks and their racially loaded nature during the Democratic debate on Univision earlier in the week.Then Sanders returned to the instigator of the violence, Donald Trump himself, and wrote,  What caused the violence at Trump s rally is a campaign whose words and actions have encouraged it on the part of his supporters.  Sanders points out that Trump recently said he d like to punch a protester  in the face  and yearned for the days when a protester would be  carried out on a stretcher.  Sanders  campaign also pointed out that Trump s campaign manager has been accused of assaulting a female reporter, Michelle Fields of the conservative Breitbart News.Sanders concludes his release with a demand of Trump and his campaign: What Donald Trump must do now is stop provoking violence and make it clear to his supporters that people who attend his rallies or protest should not be assaulted, should not be punched, should not be kicked.

I understand your pain,  Seum claimed before telling Kuiper that her rape is not as important as protecting her rapist from  government intrusion. But I can tell you I have eight children and 21 grandkids, that over the years this government through its intrusion has done more damage to me than all those criminals out there ever did,  he callously continued.You read that right. A Republican literally told a rape victim that the unwanted intrusion of her body by her rapist is less important than making sure the rapist is shielded from the government.According to the Courier-Journal:Seum did not elaborate on what type of government intrusion he experienced. But at a Judiciary Committee meeting last month, he said that he had been called as a witness several years ago in a child abuse case in family court where  the father was accused of spanking his child. He didn t provide any further details.Kuiper, however, was severely shaken by the ordeal. I was shaken and felt sick after his comments,  Kuiper said.  Basically, he had told us he had suffered worse crimes than us. Democratic state Rep. Sannie Overly blasted Seum for his remarks and called for her colleague to apologize to every woman in Kentucky for brushing off their safety in favor of defending rapists. A rape victim brave enough to step forward and share her personal story of a heinous crime should not get a lecture. He should apologize to these people and all Kentucky women who have experienced this horrific crime. The bill eventually passed 6-4 despite Seum voting against it, but once again, a Republican lawmaker demonstrates that the GOP still doesn t care about women who are raped.Earlier this year, a Republican in Idaho with five daughters of his own made incredibly creepy claims about rape. Now, I m of the understanding that in many cases of rape it does not involve any pregnancy because of the trauma of the incident,  GOP state Rep. Nielsen said during a hearing on an abortion bill.  That may be true with incest a little bit I read a lot of information. I have read it several times. Being a father of five girls, I ve explored this a lot.

For all these people know, they weren t Trump supporters. Maybe they would have walked away saying,  You know what? He s not for me.  We ll never know now. Well, seems that Kelly has forgotten a very key component to the First Amendment. Freedom of assembly is a right granted to everyone.

If a group of legislators got together and said,  Hey, you know what would be a good idea? Allowing violent people who beat their wives and children to openly carry firearms.  This idea seems so ridiculous that even the most die-hard Second Amendment cheerleaders could not stand behind it   but that s exactly what happened in the Oklahoma House of Representatives Thursday.House Bill 3098, authored by state Rep. Jeff Coody (R-Insane), that carrying a firearm is a right guaranteed by both the Constitution and God. According to Coody and the bill s co-authors, Bible-believing Christians have a right to defend themselves. Coody says that the Second Amendment is the most important thin in the Bill of Rights, which can not be infringed upon   even, of course, if someone beats his entire family with a crowbar. It s the ultimate freedom bill regarding open carry,  Coody said of his bill, with Rep Jeff Bennett adding that It s our God-given right to defend ourself. Is it a good idea to let anyone carry a gun, even if they don t know how to use it or even where the safety is?  Democratic Rep. Emily Virgin asked during debate on the bill   but Coody shut her down with a burst of stupidity: The key word is  let.  Somehow we ve gotten the idea that the government has to give us permission to exercise our freedoms. That is totally antithetical to me. The bill precludes felons from open carry, but does not prevent those under domestic violence protective orders from waving their firearms around. In addition, it does not require safety course, training, or anything that a reasonable person would consider necessary for responsible firearm use. Asked why gun owners are not required to receive training, Coody explained: Because driving is privilege. The Second Amendment is a constitutional right. But what about my safety?  Rep. Mike Brown asked.  Doesn t the government have a responsibility to protect me? No,  Coody said, asserting that more guns make people safer even though rapes in Oklahoma are at a 10-year high since the state passed a concealed carry law. Coody might be interested to know that regularions in the automobile industry drastically reduced deaths-by-car between 1950 and 2014, proving that reasonable safety regulations can have a very positive effect. Interestingly, the government did not enact a massive car-grab, and people are still able to drive if they receive the proper training and licensing   just as it should be with guns.While we might expect that Republicans could compromise, they have already done so. The bill originally removed licensing and training requirements for concealed carry, as well. The bill passed with an astounding 73-15 vote, with 13 abstaining.Coody s legislation will now go to the state Senate, where hopefully it will be modified to include training requirement, or at least prevent domestic abusers from marching with their gun on display 301 feet from their victims  houses  or killed altogether. If that doesn t happen, Rep. Virgin has a sobering prediction: Guns and domestic violence are main problems. Women die of it every day. Increasing access to guns without training, without background checks, women will die because of that.

And this racism isn t new, it hasn t been brought about by anyone, it never went away, but rather into hiding. However, with people like Donald Trump openly spewing his racist rhetoric at any chance he can get, it opened the floodgates for racists everywhere to feel that behavior is now somehow acceptable.But guess what? We are in the year 2016, and racism will be called out. This isn t an infringement on any constitutional right. In fact, it is the right of the protesters to openly dissent and condemn racism where it stands.Featured image via Instagram/Instagram/Twitter""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Trump repeated the statement later, during an interview with MSNBC s Chris Matthews. After speaking with law enforcement, I just thought it would be a wise thing for us to postpone this rally. But Chicago police say that Trump s statement is not true.The Chicago Police Department released a formal statement regarding the cancelled rally, saying: CPD did not meet with the Trump campaign prior to the cancellation of the event, nor did we make any suggestion that the event be cancelled. According to Chicago Police Interim Supt. John Escalante, the Chicago police previously assured Trump that they had more than enough police presence to negate any safety risks at the event.Escalante told Matthews: The Chicago Police Department had no role,  in the decision to cancel the rally. In fact, I can tell you we did assure the Trump campaign that we had more than adequate resources outside the UIC Pavilion and that we guaranteed them we could provide safe access and exit for Mr. Trump. Here s more on the story from CBS Chicago.We always knew that Donald Trump was a lying windbag.But Friday s events give us an even better idea of how Trump would respond in the face of even the slightest threat.The brave, bold leader of the far right abandoned his faithful followers without a second thought. And all because some Black and brown people showed up to one of his rallies, carrying protest signs.Yet Trump would have them believe that in the face of a real terror attack, he d never, ever disappear from the radar the way George W. Bush did on 9/11.Actions speak louder than words.Trump clearly chose to blame Chicago police for a decision that was entirely his own. And why wouldn t he? His supporters aren t the type of people who would forgive their supposedly-fearless leader for admitting that he s a big fat coward.It takes absolutely no courage to spew a lot of racist, hate speech to an auditorium full of people who share your disturbing worldview.On the other hand, it takes enormous courage to stand up against the kind of hate that the right wing is spreading in America.It takes courage to walk into an arena packed full of rabid Trump supporters; people who believe that what our country needs right now is more hate, more fear, more ugliness, more racism, more religious bigotry, more intolerance, more violence  and stand against those messages, chanting  Hey Hey, Ho Ho, Donald Trump has got to go,  and  Bernie!

However, Obeidallah pointed out that her information is misleading because Indonesia, which is the largest Muslim country in the world, has a more favorable view of the United States than Germany and if a Muslim country has an unfavorable view of America, it s because of U.S. foreign policy and not some congenital hatred for the United States.For example, Pierson cited that polls show that the Palestinian Territories, the majority of whose inhabitants are Muslim, have an unfavorable view of the United States. While this is true, it s because when Palestinian civilians are tear gassed, gunned down in the streets, or bombed from the air, it s with US made weapons it gives to Israel. If the Palestinians were majority Christian or Jewish, they would still have an unfavorable view of the United States.Watch Here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuMKCqgm0Gg]Obeidallah also fired back at Pierson and Trump s idiocy by pointing to Trump s business dealings in Muslim countries. He said: Let s be honest. Donald Trump says here in America, Islam hates us. Then he goes to Dubai and does multi-million dollar business deals. Donald Trump loves Muslims when he s making money with them. He loves you when he s making money and demonizes you when he s getting votes. He s a despicable hypocrite. A special kind of hypocrite.

The Democratic candidates had harsh words for the billionaire on Friday evening after news broke of the clashes.The violence in St. Louis left protesters bruised and bloody after rabid Trump fanboys decided that putting their hands on people who do not agree with them was appropriate. This came just one day after a man was sucker-punched by a Trump supporter at a rally in North Carolina.After the St. Loius rally, Trump was supposed to travel to Chicago and speak to a crowd there, but cancelled after thousands of protesters showed up to shut him down. The protesters did not want the bombastic real estate mogul sullying their town with his angry and divisive rhetoric. It was really a sight to behold, Chicago made us proud.After the cancelling the rally, Trump made his rounds on cable news networks and pretended he had no idea why the people were fighting at his rallies. He s such a positive guy! He only wants to unite white people Americans.The Democratic presidential candidates, however, placed the blame squarely at Trump s feet where it belonged.Bernie Sanders spoke out during his own rally in Summit, Illinois and called for unity: What this campaign is about is bringing our people together. Not letting Donald Trump or anybody else divide us up. No, we are not going to hate Mexicans. We re not gonna hate Muslims. We re not gonna insult women. We re not gonna insult veterans. We re not gonna insult African-Americans. We are gonna bring our people together Hillary Clinton released a statement on Twitter, saying, Violence has no place in our politics.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""On Friday, Donald Trump canceled a rally in Chicago because he was embarrassed that seemingly more people showed up to protest him than to stroke his ego. The night had already been bloody, with an event in St. Louis, Missouri almost becoming a total race war earlier in the evening. In Chicago, Trump has not even arrived when the incredibly white attendees began attacking, hurling insults at, and geerally being complete racist d*ckbags to black people and anyone else who dissented   just like Trump taught them to (after all, he says he will pay their legal fees if they brutalize a black man in his name).The Donald says he was forced to cancel his rally because he didn t want anyone to  get hurt    though he was perfectly willing to call into Fox News to whine about how somehow his First Amendment rights had been stripped away by protesters, once again proving that not a single Republican anywhere understands the First Amendment. According to the billionaire 2016 hopeful, the blame for violence at his rallies lies with two entities: the protesters his fans attack, and Barack Obama.Shortly after, Rachel Maddow took a moment out of her show to absolutely and utterly destroy any claim Trump could make that he doesn t want violence at his rallies, that he just wants people to be safe as he claims. It s becoming more intense at Donald Trump rallies,  Maddow said after playing a clip of the numerous beatings we have seen at his campaign events throughout recent history: There have been instances in the past where he has encouraged or at least praised the idea of violent actions by his supporters, when he s spoken wistfully about how great it would be to beat people up at his rallies, or he s told people that he would pay their legal fees if they beat up a protester on his behalf. But this sort of bloodlust, this kind of half-tongue-in-cheek-mostly-serious call for a  tougher America  where there are more beatings, and where anti-Trump protesters should fear for their lives as he heads into these tinderbox cities today and tonight, I just want you to watch how that part of candidate Donald Trump s rhetoric has escalated. Maddow rolled numerous clips of Trump calling for his violent, racist, and  poorly educated  fans to harm others   with date stamps included. In other words, she left Trump in a completely indefensible position, not that it matters to him or his followers.  If you want to see the deliberate act that created what happened tonight in Chicago, watch where it came from,  she said, noting that all the calls for violence culminated into the Chicago incident. And it really is something like we have never seen in mainstream American politics before,  Maddow told viewers, recalling that she used to see these events unfold at white supremacist rallies in the 1980 s. The difference, of course, is that it is now happening in mainstream Republican politics at events hosted by their frontrunner. Anybody who tells you that there s no connection between the behavior of the mob at these events and the behavior of the man leading the mob at these events is not paying attention to what he s saying at the podium,  she said after the clips rolled. but the most damning clip she rolled was of Trump in St. Louis earlier that evening when he complained that  part of the problem is no body wants to hurt each other anymore. That s right   he complained that there was not enough violence at his events to put protesters in their place.  There used to be consequences,  he whined just before St. Louis erupted into violence.  These people are bringing us down,  he whined.  These are the people that are destroying our country. That s the way Donald Trump has been talking about protesters at his events. That s the way he has been directing his supporters at events. That was today,  Maddow said after the damning St. Louis footage rolled.  If you want to know what led up to Chicago tonight that was Donald Trump s display of leadership and calming the waters.  Then she dropped the bomb: American presidential politics isn t like this for anyone else. American presidential politics did not get this way on its own. This is the workd of an American presidential candidate who deliberately made this happen. And the Republican party is about to nominate him for President.

As Bill Maher pointed out Friday night on Real Time, there are a growing number of Bernie Sanders supporters joining a movement called #BernieOrBust who have vowed to stay home in November if Hillary Clinton is the nominee.This is, of course, the single dumbest thing anyone looking to improve our country s already improving socioeconomic landscape could possibly do. Regardless of your feelings about Hillary Clinton s platform, record or ties to big business, the alternative is complete disaster. By removing support for your party s candidate you are effectively handing the White House to the Republicans. That socioeconomic progress I mentioned? Kiss it goodbye.The country will be thrust right back into economic crisis as regulations disappear. The already established nuclear deal with Iran will be tossed aside and the precision targeting strategy against ISIS will be scrapped in favor of all-out, boots on the ground war in the middle east. The Judicial branch of our government will see at least one and probably at least three new ultra-conservative justices, giving free reign to bigotry in this country under the guise of  religious liberty.  Gay marriage will be a thing of the past. Voter suppression and gerrymandering will run rampant, making it nearly impossible for logic and reason to ever take hold in our country again. Roe v Wade could very well be overturned, and Citizens United will not only be cemented in but built upon, taking the power of the people and handing it to the highest bidder.All of that because Bernie supporters don t like Hillary Clinton? It s ridiculous. Maher is himself a huge Bernie supporter, having publicly endorsed him and shown great enthusiasm about the direction he wants to take the country, but as he points out, if Hillary Clinton is the nominee, it would be incredibly stupid for anyone calling themselves a liberal or progressive to hand the election to a Republican, none of whom amount to half the person Hillary or Bernie are.Bernie Sanders is a great man who would do great things for this country if elected President. Hillary Clinton is a great woman who would do great things for this country if elected President. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are all fringe right lunatics who would destroy this country for the good of the one percent.

Both CEO Steven Nardizzi, and COO, Al Giordano were terminated by the board of directors, following an internal audit.The organization has been the subject of rumors and accusations for a number of years, many of which were focused on the higher-than-average salaries paid to Wounded Warrior Project executives, along with questions about the amount of money the charity spends on fundraising.While other veterans charities spend as much as 98 percent of money raised on veterans, the Wounded Warrior Project only spends about 60 percent. According to the CBS report, anywhere from 40 to 50 percent of money raised by the Wounded Warrior Project goes to staff and fundraising, instead of veterans.If that s bad enough, the charity may not use the small percentage of funds it does spend on veterans in the way you might think.The Wounded Warrior Project claims some 56,000 veterans as  alumni,  veterans who have registered with the organization.But according to The Daily Beast, many of the veterans counted as  alumni  in 2014 had no contact with the organization during that year. Just 62 percent of so-called  alumni  of the Wounded Warrior Project had participated in even one activity in 2014.As The Daily Beast reports here, Ken Davis, a veteran who served in Iraq before being injured, is considered among the  alumni  of the Wounded Warrior Project even though he said he no longer wants to be associated with it. Davis told The Daily Beast, I receive more marketing stuff from them, [and see more of that] than the money they ve put into the community here in Arizona. It s just about numbers and money to them. Never once did I get the feeling that it s about veterans. He is not the only veteran to report this experience. As Addicting Info reported here, Courtney Leigh Schumacher reached out to the Wounded Warrior Project when her husband lost both his legs in the line of duty.Rather than answer her requests for help with the things her family needed, the Wounded Warrior Project sent her a lot of useless stuff, including  hats, stickers, magnets, clothing and backpacks,  all displaying the organization s logo.There s no doubt that firing Nardizzi and Giordano is a step in the right direction.Yet that step alone may not be enough to fix the charity s negative image, or restore the trust of veterans and the public.Here s more on this story via CBS News:Image credit: video screen capture via CBS News""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But unless you are on the playing field, football is a spectator sport. Democracy is not a spectator sport. In Florida, voter turnout, especially for Democrats, is a big issue. There are more than 300,000 Democrats registered in the state of Florida than Republicans.

A trio of Native Americans dressed in traditional garments sat in one of the rows in front of the press box. College kids screamed with excitement as though they were at a Justin Timberlake concert. Veterans cheered with signs of support. A local punk band warmed up the crowd in anticipation for Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard to introduce Senator Sanders. At the end of Sanders  speech, supporters stormed towards the stage desperately trying to get a selfie with Bernie or at least get close enough to shake his hand.Normally, this excitement is reserved for Justin Bieber concerts or NFL football games, but all over the country apathy and disenfranchisement from the American political system is losing out to Americans, young, old, and every demographic in between, getting excited about having a voice, and being heard on issues that affect us all.

There s no doubt about that.And about an hour later, Hillary acknowledged that she was wrong, noting how utterly incorrect she was in her original statement.

She doesn t double down on it, like many politicians, even recently, have done. She doesn t say it was a  gotcha question  that forced her to say the wrong thing. She owned it. And owning a mistake, no matter the size, is actually a quality you want in a leader, to be frank. You don t want someone who can t recognize their blunders.

Rubio, who pretty much has no hope for becoming the GOP nominee, spoke some truth when he said: I know people like it that Donald Trump says whatever he wants and whatever they feel like saying. Presidents cannot say anything they want. Presidents have to understand that their words have consequences, often life and death consequences, for real people in the real world. Because of Trump s inflammatory, foul remarks, Rubio said what any level-headed American instinctively knows: that Trump wouldn t be a  good commander-in-chief  if he can t work with America s armed service in its entirety   because many of those members are Muslims. Rubio posed this question: How are you going to face them as commander-in-chief, knowing you re going around saying all Muslims hate the United States? I don t think you re going to be able to be a good commander-in-chief. You can watch Rubio s criticism of the business mogul below:These statements from Rubio come just one day after Rubio slammed Trump during Thursday s Republican debate, stating that defending Muslims isn t about being politically correct  after Trump insisted that  Islam hates us. During the debate, Rubio made similar comments to his interview on CNN: I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says, because he says what people wish they could say. The problem is presidents can t just say anything they want. It has consequences, here and around the world. Stating that although there are dangers in the world in regards to radical Islam, it s wrong to generalize an entire religion. Rubio said: There is no doubt that radical Islam is a danger to the world. I can also tell you that if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you re going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world, you re going to see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims. Rubio s right, whether you agree with him as a presidential candidate or not   and this goes way beyond Trump s feelings about the Islamic faith. He s demonstrated the same anger and insensitivity toward Hispanics, women and many other minority groups. Trump s inflammatory, hateful rhetoric has the power and influence to divide this nation instead of unify it. He s taken the most awful aspects of the Republican party and amplified them. Just by the way his rallies have transformed into fighting arenas, Trump has already demonstrated that he approves of violence and cares very little about peace and the well-being of Americans his bigotry doesn t support. He s dangerous behind comprehension, and his brand of ignorance threatens to destroy America.Featured image via Gage Skidmore""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The retired neurosurgeon who was once leading the Republican party before a severe case of dishonesty and ridiculous nonsense-spewing habit ruined his campaign is once again making headlines, for an even more awful reason than before.On Friday, Carson announced his endorsement of Republican front-runner Donald Trump at a press conference, saying that the two men had  buried the hatchet  and that Trump was  the voice of the people to be heard. Almost as ridiculous as that endorsement is Carson s inspiration for such a horrible decision   he says he was encouraged to support the disgraced candidate after a so-called vision from God.During the press conference, a reporter made the mistake of asking Carson just how much God played a part in his choice to stand behind Trump. The reporter asked,  You said throughout your life God has led you to your most important decisions. This truly is an important decision. Did God lead you to Donald Trump? Carson said that God had given him several signs   once of which included a vision from an unnamed friend. I prayed about it a lot, and I got a lot of indications, people calling me that I haven t talked to for a long time saying, I had this dream about you and Donald Trump   I mean, just amazing things As if Carson couldn t make himself seem any crazier, he dialed things up when he started speaking about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stating that she is of the devil.

He wrote the book  Rules for Radicals  and if you haven t read it, I recommend that you read it, and see the kinds of things that are recommended to change, fundamentally change, this nation from the great success we have to a socialist country. And the dedication page of that book says, dedicated to Lucifer, the original radical who gained his own kingdom. I don t want anything to do with anything like that. You can watch this outrageous part of the conference unfold below:Carson also said that he was afraid Hillary Clinton  would destroy America    a hilarious statement considering that most of the GOP is currently freaking out because Trump is leading the party and threatening to do just that. This endorsement from Carson is even more puzzling because just two weeks ago, Carson said that Super Tuesday voters were not  quite that dense  to help Trump become the nominee. The former candidate also said that voting for Trump was  a very very bad mistake.

On Thursday, Tuscon Weekly reported that a member of the party that constantly introduces dubiously-named  religious freedom  legislation has no respect for the religious practices of Native Americans. Republican Congressman Paul Gosar is furious that President Obama thwarted his effort to sell an Apache holy site to foreign business interests.Joining with Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick   a Democrat who bears equal shame in this horrific endeavor to place greed over decency   attempted to have an area known as Oak Flat, or Chi chil Bildagoteel, sold to British-Australian owned Resolution Copper in what would have marked the first time in history that Native American land would be handed over to foreign interests by Congress.To protest the attempt to sell of holy land, 300 Apaches marched 44 miles to occupy the ancient sacred ground where the New York Times reports coming-of-age ceremonies, especially for girls, have been performed  for many generations, along with traditional acorn gathering.  The area has been closed to mining since 1955 when then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower recognized the importance of protecting the land. The ban was reinforced in 1971 by the Nixon administration. Though the land is protected, Kirkpatrick and Gosar managed to slide a provision that would hand the land over to the mining company into the National Defense Authorization Act. The Times reports that:The land grab was sneakily anti-democratic even by congressional standards. For more than a decade, the parcel containing Oak Flat has been coveted by Rio Tinto, Resolution s parent company   which already mines on its own private land in the surrounding area   for the high-value ores beneath it.The swap   which will trade 5,300 acres of private parcels owned by the company to the Forest Service and give 2,400 acres including Oak Flat to Resolution so that it can mine the land without oversight   had been attempted multiple times by Arizona members of Congress on behalf of the company. (Among those involved was Rick Renzi, a former Republican representative who was sent to federal prison in February for three years for corruption related to earlier versions of the land-transfer deal.) It always failed in Congress because of lack of support. But this time was different. This time, the giveaway language was slipped onto the defense bill by Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona at the 11th hour. The tactic was successful only because, like most last-minute riders, it bypassed public scrutiny.Unfortunately for the duo, the Obama Administration swooped in to save the day. The Park Service and Forest Service listed the land as a historic location, thus preventing the sale   and Gosar is furious. In a press release, the Congressman melted down over the bad (for him) news: Shame on the Park Service and Forest Service for ramming a bogus historic place listing down the throats of Arizonans. Clearly, the Obama Administration cares more about pandering to extremist environmental groups and a D.C. lobbyist from the Clinton Administration than following the law and listening to the American public. Oak Flat has never been a sacred site, as confirmed by the local tribe s own former historian. Yet, Obama s minions are hell-bent on sabotaging an important mining effort by listing a small, public campground 20 miles away from the nearest tribe s reservation as a historic site. While Gosar claims the site has never been sacred, the Apache people disagree. Why is this place sacred?  former chairman of the San Carlos Apache, Wendsler Nosie Sr., mused.  No difference to Mount Sinai. How the holy spirit came to be.  This claim has been backed by Scientists for the Society for American Archaeology, who testified before Congress that archaeological evidence shows that the site has been used for religious purposes since  well before recorded history. Demonstrating Republicans  impressive ability to ignore facts, Gosar insists that  This fraudulent action is the latest in a long list of egregious bureaucratic abuses of power by the Obama Administration. Oak Flat, known to us Chi chil Bildagoteel, has always been our connection to our Mother, our right to exist, a central part of our prayers, songs, stories and spiritual practices. It is from here that we emerged. It is who we are, Nosie wrote in a press release.  Chi chil Bildagoteel, our holy land, was put under the care of the U.S. government, and because of its uniqueness, the great value of maintaining its ecological and cultural integrity, protected by its laws. While Gosar, or Republicans in general for that matter, care not for any religion besides Christianity, this halting of an extraordinarily offensive abuse of Congressional power should serve as a lesson that no matter how hard the GOP tries, reasonable and right-thinking people will always be here to stand in the way of these abuses.Featured image via EarthWorks Action""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

If you re a voter and Marco Rubio is not necessarily your first choice   if you like John Kasich or you like Ted Cruz and you re here in Florida, you need to vote for Marco Rubio because he s the only one who can deprive Donald Trump of those 99 delegates,  Conant went on to say.

If we re going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you ve got to be willing to take on the lobbyists Patiently waiting to go in for the kill, Trump responded by reminding the audience that Ted Cruz actually flip-flopped on that particular issue in Iowa because as Bloomberg reported at the time, ethanol is  the third rail of Iowa politics, across party and socioeconomic lines. Indeed, that meant Cruz had to say anything to win, even if it meant throwing his support behind ethanol production. Because if he didn t, he d be telling 50,000 Iowans that he opposes them having a job. Cruz even wrote an op-ed whining about how his opponents have slammed his anti-ethanol views and he lied to Iowa farmers to their faces by claiming he was fighting for them. By this point in the campaign, many readers will have seen the furious coordinated effort being waged by Democrats and big-money lobbyists, who are together spending hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to convince Iowans that I oppose ethanol. Their charges are utter nonsense. However, those farmers didn t mean much to Cruz last night as he bragged about how he OPPOSED ethanol in Iowa and Trump quickly called him out for lying.

Diapers are often all that stand between your child being warm, dry and comfortable and in complete misery. For far too many parents, this one commodity has to sometimes be treated like a luxury due to the cost. You re faced with a dilemma from the moment you walk into the store to that first changing afterward: Do you buy the cheap store brand that will need to be changed immediately or do you invest in premium brands that your child can wear a little bit longer if she just had a little bit of a pee?Think that s an exaggeration or a choice nobody makes? Think again. Diapers are expensive and they go fast. Getting as many miles as possible out of a wet diaper is a choice poor parents are faced with every day.The Obama administration has unveiled a plan to aid non-profit companies in streamlining the packaging and sale of disposable diapers to low-income families.

Specializing in frozen drinks and younger clientele, the new bar was immediate success   unless you poll the neighbors. Trops doesn t just attract younger people, it tends to attract a diverse younger crowd that includes a hearty percentage of African-Americans.The neighbors, used to the noise and traffic of bars in this party-rich neighborhood, were happy to have the white college crowd for years, but for some reason just couldn t handle Trops. The bar came under immediate attack from local code officials who complained about everything from loud music to trash on the streets to parking   all things associated with a bar.Trops immediately complied with every single one of the city s demands and, in fact, went far beyond what was expected of them. They hired extra help and off-duty police officers to pick up trash outside and direct traffic. They shut down their patio music at 11PM when other bars nearby raged on. They closed their doors voluntarily at midnight even though their license allowed them to stay open until 1:30AM. They even stopped serving to-go drinks in vacuum sealed, perfectly legal cups.To owner Billy Thompson, there was nothing left to do. Not only had he complied with the city s demands, he even instituted a dress code that disallowed baggy pants and hoodies. After all was said and done, the ruling came down: Trops will lose its liquor license on April 9th; bigotry wins. The bar s Facebook page announced the closure, which came as no surprise to some fans: Those are just a couple of the comments from patrons of the bar. Some have tried to take race out of the equation, blaming the closure on the bar breaking open-carry laws and serving drinks out of a drive-through window, but those claims are hyperbole considering the cups the bar used before they stopped serving to-go drinks were legal by the standards of the City Commissioner and the drive-through was an urban legend from the original location in Columbia. Local news has also pointed out that there seems to be little other than race keeping Trops from prospering in the vast community of bars in the area.This is just another case of a business that caters to everyone trying to succeed in a neighborhood where  everyone  means  all shapes and sizes of white people.

Watch the clip here:Trump has received a barrage of criticism, some comparing him to the notorious dictator including Louis CK, who said,  he is dangerous. Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto said Trump s campaign had similarities to the rise of the Nazi leader.In an interview with Good Morning America, Trump said of the comparisons:It s a terrible comparison. I m not happy about that, certainly. I don t want that comparison. But you know we have to be strong, and we have to be vigilant. People agree with that. We don t want to lose our jobs to China. And we don t want to lose our jobs to Mexico and Japan, If Trump doesn t want such comparisons, then he should stop propagating in ways that remind the world of the notorious Nazi dictator.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This visit has been a celebration of the values that we share,  Obama began. We as a people are committed to the principles of equality and opportunity. The idea that if you work hard and play by the rules you can make it if you try no matter what the circumstances of your birth in both of our countries. Obama started out serious and thoughtful, setting up those in attendance for what would be a hilarious joke at Ted Cruz s expense, thus once again demonstrating his mastery of comedy. We see this in our current presidential campaign. Where else could a boy born in Calgary run for president of the United States? Here s the video via YouTube.For years, Republicans have claimed that President Obama is illegitimate because they say he wasn t born in the United States even though records clearly prove that President Obama was born in Hawaii to an American mother in 1961.But during this GOP Primary, Ted Cruz has been running for president even though he really was born in a different country, and only Donald Trump has repeatedly pointed that out throughout the race while other Republicans hypocritically remain silent.But President Obama also alluded to Trump in a separate joke, mentioning how Canada is welcoming Americans into their nation if Trump somehow wins the presidency and how our neighbors to the North refuse to build a wall to keep us out in our time of need. Where else would we see a community like Cape Breton, Nova Scotia welcoming Americans if the election does not go their way? And to the great credit of their people, Canadians from British Columbia to New Brunswick have, so far, rejected the idea of building a wall to keep out your southern neighbors. We appreciate that.

In 2014, he told the Las Vegas Sun: People can relate to me, and they root for me because on the show I am the dumb guy, the one who is a little rougher around the edges.

Trump University does not currently have an A rating with BBB. The BBB Business Review for this company has continually been  No Rating  since September 2015.  Prior to that, it fluctuated between D- and A+.3. The document posted on social media on Thursday night was not a current BBB Business Review of Trump University.  It appeared to be part of a Business Review from 2014.4. BBB ratings are based on information we obtain about a business, including complaints received from the public.  The reporting period is three years.  Detailed information about BBB ratings is available on all 5.3 million Business Reviews on our website, bbb.org.5. At no point did BBB change the rating of Trump University based upon a demand from anyone.  BBB followed its standard evaluation process applicable to all businesses.6. During the period when Trump University appeared to be active in the marketplace, BBB received multiple customer complaints about this business. These complaints affected the Trump University BBB rating, which was as low as D- in 2010.  As the company appeared to be winding down, after 2013, no new complaints were reported. Complaints over three years old automatically rolled off of the Business Review, according to BBB policy. As a result, over time, Trump University s BBB rating went to an A in July 2014 and then to an A+ in January 2015.7.  Trump University has never been a BBB Accredited Business.

It sure feels that way to me. I m about half German, same as Trump. And it feels like a racial insult to me.I m not easily offended, but I don t see any other way to interpret the incessant Hitler analogies directed at Trump. If he were female and Asian   with exactly the same policies   would we be comparing him to Hitler every five seconds?I don t think so.There are, of course, a few things wrong with Adams  analysis:  German  isn t a race, Hitler wasn t German, comparing one person with German ancestry to an infamous tyrant isn t  racist , the list goes on..But more to the point, Donald Trump wouldn t be an Asian female, because Donald Trump s policies   at their core   appeal to white supremacists who would never consider voting for a woman of color. The kind of hate-fueled rhetoric that makes Trump soar in the Republican polls is at the expense of minorities, women, and other disadvantaged groups. You know who else used prejudice and scapegoating to fire up his supporters? Adams sure can t think of anyone!However, Adams believes that Trump is actually the anti-Hitler, because   and this is pretty astounding   Trump is actually  pro-minority.  But only the  minorities  Adams considers worthy:What Adams doesn t mention are actual minorities, including Hispanics that Trump described as  rapists  or African Americans, who have been repeatedly violently attacked at his rallies. The minorities Adams counts are mostly just aggrieved white people who want things their way and are upset that President Obama won t give it to them.What about the Muslims Trump suggested should be banned? Adams agrees that s discrimination, but says they deserve it.Trump has indeed suggested discrimination against incoming Muslims. But I think you have to see this situation as a special case because Sharia law is incompatible with the Constitution of the United States. And conquering infidels is part of the Islamic belief system in some corners of Islam. If we can t tell the good people from the bad, it boils down to national security and risk-management.Hilariously, Adams concludes by begging his readers to instead try to compare Hitler to people like  Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, and Gandhi.  He claims it s  easier than you want to believe.  He doesn t explain how.Despite all of this lunacy, Adams says he isn t endorsing Trump for president, but only because the Republican front-runner  scares  people too much to effectively bring the country together. However, he is optimistic that Trump could  persuade  people not to be afraid of him using his  deal-making  skills. If that happens, Adams seems to think Trump would be an awesome president. Just ask all those  minorities  he mentioned.Featured image via ibmphoto24/Flickr ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Graham insisted that he just wants to have a nominee that will be chosen by the next president, but it seems to be more personal. To be completely honest, this is the first time the Judiciary Committee has refused to hold a hearing for a nominee since it began holding hearings for nominations   and it s because the GOP takes major issue with Obama.

It s not as if there s a massive difference between Mr. Trump s position on immigration and Mr. Cruz s position on immigration. Mr. Trump might just be more provocative in terms of how he says it, but the actual positions are not that different. For that matter, they re not that different from Mr. Rubio s positions on immigration, despite the fact that both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, their own families are the result of immigration and the openness of our society. In the end, President Obama dropped the hammer on Republicans who are trying to wash their hands of any responsibility for what is happening to their own party by blaming him instead of themselves.

And it s getting worse by the day.In a glimpse of what Trump s presidency may look like should he win, his entourage refused to take responsibility for violently shoving a female reporter at a campaign rally because they thought she was part of the liberal media. They did, however, express remorse after learning she was from conservative website Breitbart. Apparently, violence against reporters is okay, but only if they aren t well-known Trump cheerleaders.Reporters identified Trump s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski after he grabbed Breitbart journalist Michelle Fields  arm and tried to throw her to the ground. According to her boyfriend and colleague Jamie Weinstein from the Daily Caller, Trump s  thugs  retaliated after Fields tried to ask Trump a  tough question. Trump always surrounds himself w thugs. Tonight thug Corey Lewandowski tried to pull my gf @MichelleFields to ground when she asked tough q  Jamie Weinstein (@Jamie_Weinstein) March 9, 2016Instead of apologizing, or better yet, resigning, Lewandowski excused his actions by saying he simply used violence against the wrong person.Lewandowski s explanation to Boyle, said these sources, was that he and Fields had never met before and that he didn t recognize her as a Breitbart reporter, instead mistaking her for an adversarial member of the mainstream media.The admission confirms what many on-lookers have known for quite some time: It s open season on people who speak out against Trump or his campaign. Recently, Trump s secret service detail, nicknamed by appalled critics as  Trump s SS,  choke-slammed a TIME magazine photographer when he stepped outside of the  pen  Trump keeps journalists in at his rally. (Yes, he really does this.) Trump has also made comments about opening up libel laws to go destroy journalists who write things that are negative about him.Adding some bitter irony to all of this is the fact that Breitbart has been a shameless promoter of Trump since the word  go.  At times there homepage is devoted solely to singing Trump s praises. So the question became, how would they respond to this flagrant act of violence towards one of their journalists?  The answer was: Throw Fields under the bus.Rather than stand up for one of their employees, the staff at Breitbart have at various times called into question the veracity of her claims. Breitbart writers went full-false flag on their own reporter. Here s Fields  colleague explicitly calling her a liar on Twitter.Indeed, Breitbart s CEO hinted that Fields was not telling the truth about their beloved candidate as well, saying only that  if  someone did grab her, then they should apologize. So much for standing up for your employees, huh? (UPDATE: After wide-spread condemnation from journalists standing in solidarity with Fields, Breitbart reportedly suspended Patrick Howley.)Breitbart readers, naturally, weren t much more sympathetic. After Fields penned a (very careful) essay on what happened to her, this sexist screed became the number one comment.Breitbart has made a name for itself for its use of bullying and mudslinging as a business model. They frequently post stories targeting non-public figures and use their frenzied hate mob readers as a personal army to attack liberals or critics. Fields certainly doesn t deserve the violence she experienced from Trump s staff, nor the ugly backlash she s getting from her own readers, but it s not surprising. She works for a company that routinely attacks female journalists, anti-Trump conservatives, and liberals of all stripes. Her audience is primed for this sort of hate-filled dog piling. The fact that Breitbart can t even stand up for one of their own speaks volumes.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Jackson was inspired to write his feelings in a letter addressed to Trump after his teacher at Millis Road Elementary showed her class the news. Jackson s message to the business mogul is a stark reminder that even those who are too young to vote in this election are watching   and judging. Jackson wrote: I have read several articles about you and have seen you on the television. I think you have been very rude to many people. I know that you are talking to adults when you give your speeches, because they are the ones that can vote. It is important for you to remember that children are watching and hearing you, too. Someday, we will also be able to vote. Photo Credit: Kelley WheelessJackson also gave Trump a priceless lesson on manners and the  Golden Rule    do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Honestly, this is a lesson in human decency that someone as old as Trump should have learned by now. I learned about The Golden Rule when I was VERY young. How would you feel if people said some of these terrible things about you that I have heard you say about them? Do you ever feel sorry about the things that you say that are hurtful to others? I have never heard you apologize. Jackson demonstrated just how closely he s been watching Trump when he called out Trump for mocking a handicapped reporter in November. What would happen if young people decided that it was OK to make fun of handicapped people after watching you do that on national TV? Bullying is already a HUGE problem, and it is NOT OK! I feel like you could make that problem much worse. Trump also got slammed by the third grader for stating that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City and still rise in the polls. Jackson spoke for both children and (level-headed) adults when he told Trump that he flat-out terrifies people. You make kids afraid when they hear that someone who could be our next President would even think of doing something like that! Jackson left Trump with this epic piece of wisdom: start thinking of America s youth and how his words and behavior will impact them. We may not be able to vote yet, but we are the future.

She said it is  shocking  that they are unwilling to entertain the idea of a new Justice clearly caving to those on the extreme right.

Cannot see them. Cannot hear them. Then pointing out how it has been the goal of Republicans to block pretty much everything President Obama has want to accomplish since his first day in office, Warren says: Since the first day of the Obama presidency, Republican senators have bowed to extremists who reject his legitimacy and abuse the rules of the Senate in an all-out effort to cripple his administration and to paralyze the federal courts. Warren slams them for going against the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States. She goes on to say: Republican extremists aren t voting against individuals based on a good-faith judgment about a specific person. No, they are blocking votes wholesale in order to keep those jobs vacant and undermine the government itself. Driving the point home, she says:No matter how much it damages the nation, no matter how much it undermines the courts, no matter whether it cripples the government or lays waste to our Constitution, Senate Republicans do pretty much everything they can to avoid acknowledging the legitimacy of our democratically elected president For too long, the Republicans in the Senate have wanted to have it both ways: They want to feed the ugly lies and nullify the Obama presidency while also claiming that they can govern responsibly Candidates motivated by bigotry and resentment, candidates unable to govern, candidates reflecting the same extremism that has been nursed along for seven years right here in the United States Senate, are on the verge of winning the Republican party s nomination for president If it is true that some Republican senators are finally ready to stand up to the extremism that denies the legitimacy of this president and of the Constitution, I say to you, do your job Vote for a Supreme Court nominee. Warren also made sure all those unconstitutional Republicans sitting in front of her new that President Obama was elected in 2008 and 2012 by an overwhelming democratically elected majority, and by nominating someone for the Supreme Court, he is fulfilling the will of the people.However, here s the nail in the coffin: If you want to stop extremism in your party, you can start by showing the American people that you respect the president of the United States and the Constitution enough to do your job.

The ruling dealt a huge blow to the Bush administration s secretive  tribunals. Liberal backlash over Judge Srinivasan s appointment to the DC court in 2010 was centered on his role in the the defense of Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling.Since that time, however, Srinivasan has played a major role in overturning the Defense of Marriage Act. He has also written the majority opinion in important cases like Sierra Club v. Jewell, which upheld the standing of environmental groups fighting to protect a historical site in West Virginia, Pom Wonderful v. FTC, which upheld the right of the FTC to require health-related advertising to be truthful, and Home Care Association of America v. Weil, which extended labor protections to home health workers.Judge Watford was appointed to the 9th Circuit Court by President Obama in 2011.He authored the majority opinion in Patel & Patel v. City of Los Angeles, which struck down a local ordinance requiring hotel owners to turn guest registry information over to the police without a warrant.Other potential candidates that the president is considering include Judge Jane Kelly of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals based in St. Louis; and U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who serves in Washington, D.C.Although republicans have threatened to block any nominee that the president proposes, republican obstructionism has been ongoing since the day he took office. Yet somehow, President Obama has managed to accomplish more than any president in modern history.President Obama says he is going to do his job and appoint the next Supreme Court justice.If there s anything republicans should have learned by now, it s that the president does exactly what he says he is going to do.Featured image via wikimedia commons ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The party, with the help of a few sellout Democrats, passed a state law by a vote of 40-7, that would illegally seize the licenses of doctors who perform abortions.The measure does include a clause that protects doctors in the case of  life of the mother  or to preserve her health. However, there was no mention of an equivalent exception for rape or incest.The stupidity of this law can only be described as  astounding  due to its obvious unconstitutionality. It will be reversed in court once costly taxpayer-funded litigation starts, after what will likely be equally expensive appeals.One Republican, Brian Crain, was the only member of his party that voted against the law. It isn t clear if he is against the law or voted against it because it was amended heavily without allowing time for a review. However, the fact he is pro-life pro-forced birth seems to indicate he would have voted for it. One other Republican senator, Ervin Yen, was against the bill but claims he  accidentally  voted for it. That s a new way to explain bad votes for sure.The Oklahoma State Medical association is against the law for obvious reasons   one being that it is blatant and unconstitutional intimidation of doctors. It also places an undue burden on women seeking to exercise a constitutional right.The precedent that a law like this could set is downright terrifying. If you can sabotage a person s career for doing a legally protected thing, you can do it for other legally protected things.  You taught your students evolution? You lose your teaching license.

Just count how many times he uses the words  me,   I,   my  or  myself  within a speech. He s not running to lead the nation, he s running to have the nation line up behind him. He has it exactly opposite of the true intent set forth by our Founding Fathers. The President of the United States serves the nation, it s not the other way around.Knowing this full well, Barack Obama, before he was elected as the 44th President of the United States, delivered a commencement speech to Knox College in Illinois back in 2005. He spoke of who we are as a nation, and what should be expected of us, our nation and our government.One part of his speech touched upon the very important message that we are all in this together. We re not a nation of  me,  or  myself  like Trump would like you to believe, but rather a nation of  we  and  us.  After all, the nation s motto is E PLURIBUS UNUM, which means, out of many, we are one.Here is that very poignant moment from then Senator Obama: In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society. But in our past there has been another term for it   Social Darwinism, every man and woman for him or herself. It s a tempting idea, because it doesn t require much thought or ingenuity. It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford   tough luck. It allows us to say to the Maytag workers who have lost their job   life isn t fair. It let s us say to the child born into poverty   pull yourself up by your bootstraps. And it is especially tempting because each of us believes that we will always be the winner in life s lottery, that we will be Donald Trump, or at least that we won t be the chump that he tells:  Your fired! But there a problem. It won t work. It ignores our history. It ignores the fact that it has been government research and investment that made the railways and the internet possible. It has been the creation of a massive middle class, through decent wages and benefits and public schools   that has allowed all of us to prosper. Our economic dominance has depended on individual initiative and belief in the free market; but it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we re all in it together and everybody s got a shot at opportunity   that has produced our unrivaled political stability. Bravo! That man should be president. Oh wait, three years later he was.We need to remember that we re all in this together, and we really don t need someone who thinks he s running for prom king as our next president. Part of being an American is embracing the fact that we are all individuals striving for excellence, but recognizing that our excellence is only possibly because we have a society set up for all of us, not just the few. Or rather, that s the way it should be, and what we need to get back to. Electing Trump would further destroy the fabric our the nation that Republicans have been trying to tear apart slowly but surely since 1980.

A former colleague and friend of mine was on assignment at Trump s rally in Louisiana today. She posted the following account of what happened. I know and trust her implicitly. If she says it was frightening, I believe her. That s the first time in my career I ve felt like press badges weren t given to grant access, but as an identifying, isolating mark. What you ve seen on TV is nothing compared to the real thing. Some 30 people were thrown out, with the mob pointing them out and cheering, the candidate yelling,  Get them outta here!  And,  Louisiana, I m disappointed in this behavior. Why is it taking so long to remove these people? The question of  who s going to pay for the wall?  was met with a LOUD, gleeful response of,  MEXICO! And then calling out the press (in their designated pen), saying  they re the most dishonest people in the world.  A chorus of boos followed.I had no idea how upsetting this assignment would be.

I think they will bear some resemblance to a pi ata,  Cornyn said according to CNN. What I don t understand is how someone who actually wants to be confirmed to the Supreme Court would actually allow themselves to be used by the administration in a political fight that s going to last from now until the end of the year. Because there is no guarantee, certainly, after that time they re going to look as good as they did going in. Yes, Senate Republicans are so desperate to get their way that they are willing to destroy the life of anyone President Obama nominates to fill the empty Supreme Court seat even if that person has impeccable credentials and is absolutely qualified to do the job.This angered Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid so much that he entered the CNN article into the Congressional Record, where it will remain as an example of just how petulant Republicans have become, and then he took to the Senate floor to blast Cornyn and the GOP. Think about that. They don t know who the nominee is, they don t know anything about the person, but they already have in their mind they are going to beat this person like a pi ata. It doesn t matter who it is. Man, woman, old, young, it doesn t matter. Doesn t matter what their education is, what their experience is, they re going to beat them like a pi ata. I think they ve been listening to Donald Trump too much. The Republicans need to stop and listen to this disgusting rhetoric they re spewing This is vile behavior that is beneath the dignity of this institution.  Here s the video of Reid remarks via YouTube:And the American people overwhelmingly agree with Democrats on this issue.Three major polls, including a Fox News poll, reveal that most Americans WANT President Obama to nominate a replacement for Scalia and they WANT Senate Republicans to do their jobs and hold fair confirmation hearings even more. A Rasmussen poll says the same thing, and so does a CNN/ORC poll released this month.But rather than backtrack his remarks and apologize for his utter lack of professionalism, Cornyn doubled down on his threat and this time used the Senate floor to repeat his offensive promise to destroy the reputation and career of anyone who accepts the nomination, suggesting that President Obama would be at fault if Senate Republicans did such a thing. I would be surprised if any person who actually aspired to be on the United States Supreme Court, a current judge or a legal scholar or lawyer, would allow themselves to be used by this administration in making a nomination to the Supreme Court for a seat that will not be filled during the remainder of President Obama s term. Knowing that they won t be confirmed. This is totally outrageous and Senate Republicans should be ashamed of themselves.

According to a Politico report released on Tuesday, the current Republican front-runner has found a new way to ensure that protesters are mistreated during his rallies   by using security officers in street clothes so they never see it coming.This new rally tactic was put into action during a Friday rally in New Orleans, where several plainclothes security officers were seen working. Eddie Deck, one of these officers, said that he was told to do intelligence work researching possible protesters as well as assist any security officers in uniform. According to the report, Black Lives Matter protesters were escorted out of the same rally by these security officers disguised in civilian s clothing.Hope Hicks, Trump s campaign spokeswoman, has not responded to Politico s request for comment.This new initiative by the campaign makes Trump s already violent rallies even more dangerous   especially for minority groups, which have been routinely targeted. Black Lives Matter and pro-immigrant groups show up at Trump s events often to oppose his offensive anti-minority stances, and are usually forcibly removed even in instances when they re being completely peaceful. In many instances, an attack on a protester has been racially motivated. There have also been times that Trump has actually encouraged violence or egged on his protesters, telling them that he will pay any legal fees or consequences that come of their attacks.// < ![CDATA[ <span class=\""mceItemHidden\"" data-mce-bogus=\""1\""><span></span>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, <span class=\""mceItemHidden\"" data-mce-bogus=\""1\""><span class=\""hiddenSpellError\"" pre=\""\"" data-mce-bogus=\""1\"">fjs</span></span> = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v2.3\"";  <span class=\""hiddenSpellError\"" pre=\""\"" data-mce-bogus=\""1\"">fjs</span>.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', '<span class=\""hiddenSpellError\"" pre=\""\"" data-mce-bogus=\""1\"">facebook-jssdk</span>')); // ]]&gt;I m watching this shit right now on the news 2016 in Louisville KY and I m furious !!!!look at the way they treated this beautiful African American female these racist ### ######## turned the tables and you know what would happen this is what these people think about usPosted by Paul Bibbs on Tuesday, March 1, 2016But it s not just minorities that are in danger   it s basically anyone that Trump feels threatened by, and you don t have to be a protester to make Trump feel insecure.

But raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious health risks to you and your family. According to an analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between 1993 and 2006 more than 1500 people in the United States became sick from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. In addition, CDC reported that unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness and results in 13 times more hospitalizations than illnesses involving pasteurized dairy products.Despite this warning, state GOP Rep. Pat McGeehan and others drank the raw milk anyway and became sick afterwards, thus making famed scientist Louis Pasteur roll over in his grave.Pasteur is the French chemist and microbiologist who discovered pasteurization to kill harmful bacteria and microorganisms that cause foodborne sicknesses. There s definitely some other colleagues that have similar symptoms that I ve been experiencing,  McGeehan reported.However, like most times Republicans are wrong, McGeehan and his colleagues are in denial that the milk is the cause of their illness, even though they only began reporting feeling sick AFTER drinking the raw milk that the FDA advises people NOT to drink because it makes people sick.The ill lawmakers say that their Republican colleague Scott Cadle brought in the raw milk and McGeehan happened to be in the hallway when Cadle approached him to share a drink. [Cadle] caught me in the hallway, offered a cup to me, and you want to try to be a gentleman,  McGeehan said.  I had a small sip and walked away and tossed the rest of it. Gee, if raw milk isn t dangerous why toss it after a  small sip,  Mr. McGeehan?McGeehan claims that a stomach bug is the real cause of the lawmakers praying to the porcelain God and even made another dubious claim. I don t think it s any riskier than eating raw oysters or anything like that,  McGeehan said of the raw milk.Cue yet another warning from the FDA:You can get seriously ill and even die from eating raw oysters contaminated with Vibrio vulnificus   a bacterium commonly found in waters where oysters are cultivated such as the Gulf of Mexico. Vibrio vulnificus is found in higher concentrations during the summer months as water becomes warmer.Vibrio vulnificus bacteria is not a result of pollution, so although oysters should always be obtained from reputable sources, eating oysters from  clean  waters or in reputable restaurants with high turnover does not provide protection.Seriously, who elected these dumbasses to political office?Here s the video via WSAZ.The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources is currently investigating.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The attack left the victim with a broken jaw.Webster was indicted by a Grand Jury, but nevertheless cleared of Felony Assault two years later. He was allowed to resign voluntarily, meaning he is able to simply join another police department elsewhere if he chooses.To add insult to injury, Webster is also now being awarded a near quarter of a million dollar settlement by the city. While Webster leaves the force on June 30, and remains on administrative leave until that day, USA Today reports:A settlement agreement commits the city to paying Webster $230,000 over six years.

At the same time, Webster is forbidden from seeking any other job with Dover city government.Local African American leaders were pleased to see Webster go, but remain concerned that the corporal remains free to sign up to another police force and victimize yet another community elsewhere. This mixed feeling was best expressed by the pastor of a local church, Rev. Rita Page, who said: I think it s sending a message to the police that the community is not settling for anything. We re not settling for injustices. We re going to keep the pressure on until justice is served. I do have a concern because of the fact that he s voluntarily resigning, whether or not he ll be able to serve in other municipalities. I m hoping he will not. I was really hoping he would be terminated, Webster never made an apology or accepted responsibility for his attack on Lateef Dickerson.

The Pennsylvanian were jailed in 2014 for allowing their 8-month-old son Brandon to die a slow and painful death from diarrhea, rather than seek medical attention. They argued their religious beliefs stipulate that illness is a sign of  spiritual lack , and only prayer can cure it.The father, Herbert Schaible, defending their decision, said: We believe in divine healing, the Jesus shed blood for our healing and that he died on the cross to break the devil s power, What makes the case all the more shocking, is that the couple were already on probation for the involuntary manslaughter of another child. Their two-year-old child died of pneumonia in 2009 after they refused to seek medical help.The couple were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for the 2009 death, and sentenced to 10 years probation. A condition of their probation was that they sought medical attention if any of their surviving children became sick. Yet, within that probationary period, the couple allowed another child to die from a treatable illness. This time, their eight-month-old son Brandon.Addressing the couple of court, Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge Benjamin Lerner said: You ve killed two of your children   not God, not your church, not religious devotion   you. The couple has seven further surviving children.The Schaibles are part of a small Pentecostal community which, similar to the Quiverfull Christian Conservative approach to family planning   leaves the treatment of illness in what they believe to be God s hands.In 2015, 18-month-old Hope Delozier died of a treatable ear infection because her parents  were against antibiotics and other chemicals associated with modern medicine. A further 12 child deaths have been linked to the Pentecostal church, just in Idaho alone.Yet Idaho, and 31 other states, have built-in legal protections for parents who allow their children to die this way. These states have religious exemptions to felony or misdemeanor charges involving children.The Schaibles and their peers seek to protect themselves from the consequences of their actions by hiding behind this bogus freedom of religion  argument. Which is why we need to strike down these exemptions to support a common principle:No one s freedom of religion should be honored to the extent that a helpless and vulnerable child is left to die of neglect. Let alone two.Yet Republicans lawmakers are failing to back the repeal of these exemptions, with arguments epitomized by Idaho State Rep. Christy Perry, who said: This is about religious beliefs, the belief God is in charge of whether they live, and God is in charge of whether they die, This is about where they go for eternity. This has nothing to do with freedom of religion. When people become parents, they accept the responsibility to ensure the health and safety of that child through to adulthood. The Schaibles and those who think like them, choose to put their personal interpretation of their faith above their duty of care as parents. In doing so, they are turning their own children into human sacrifices. That has no place this century, let alone this country.

The officer quickly realized that a woman inside the vehicle had been shot, according to Captain Joseph Wells. The woman explained to the officer that she had been shot by her four-year-old son as he sat in the back seat of the car while the two traveled to her sister s home to pick up a horse. She was shot through the seat and the round went through her back,  Wells said, noting that there were no holes in the back of the truck, which had a horse trailer hitched to the back. The child was not strapped into his booster seat when the deputy found Gilt. There was a booster seat in the back of the vehicle, but however the boy was not strapped in when the deputy got to them,  Wells said. Investigators are working to determine if the child was strapped in at the time of the shooting.Gilt s Facebook profile is filled with posts supporting Ted Cruz, whom she says has the longest history of protecting gun rights among the 2016 field, as well as numerous other right-wing posts ranging from  wildly inaccurate  to  completely f*cking stupid  to  downright insane.  One post in particular has been drawing attention, however. Gily uploaded a photo on March 6   days before the shooting   that depicted two scary criminals who  are breaking into your home to rob you, rape your children, and kill your dog.  The ammosexual gun advocate  remarked that  being dead  might  change their plans. In the comments below the meme, Gilt cheerfully declares that all her children  know how to shoot    something her 4-year-old proved after she left a loaded gun within arm s reach of him.  Even my 4-year-old gets jacked up to target shoot with the .22.,  she wrote in response to someone who praised her  spirit and patriotic attitude. She was shot with a .45-caliber handgun, depriving the world of the most ironic Facebook post of the week.While some may argue that she is a  responsible gun owner  who was simply an unfortunate victim of circumstance and bad luck, that she would never treat a gun like a toy, a tweet from last year reveals that she considers her guns to be exactly that   toys. This is surely a belief she passes down to her children, including the one who shot her.Gilt isn t just an idiot about guns   she s full-blown, Jesus-Christ-What-The-F*ck-Weapons-Grade-Stupid. Here is just a small sampling of her Facebook posts, one of which claims that  it    presumably the Revolution   is  inevitable at this point  because one of the Oregon terrorists was shot after he attempted to pull a gun on law enforcement:      Gilt s pro-gun page is filled with similar bullsh*t: The NRA tells us that people like Gilt are ready to hop into action at a moment s notice to save us from the  bad guys with guns    and Gilt certainly thinks of herself as the mythical  Good Guy With a Gun,  a warrior sent by God herself to defend the citizenry from tyranny. The truth is that she should not have access to weapons if she can not prevent her children from having access to weapons   period.Gilt is in stable condition. The child is in the care of family and the Department of Children and Families has been notified of this completely preventable monumental act of stupidity. Wells says there will be no criminal charges because the shooting is being investigated as  accidental.  However, things may change depending on how the boy managed to get ahold of the weapon.Watch a report on the shooting below:Featured image via Facebook ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""This actually happens all the time no matter who the president is, but conservatives are throwing a tantrum because President Obama does it.On Sunday, former First Lady Nancy Reagan passed away at the age of 94. Tributes have since poured in from across the country, even from President Obama himself. Nancy Reagan once wrote that nothing could prepare you for living in the White House,  Obama said in a statement. She was right, of course. But we had a head start, because we were fortunate to benefit from her proud example, and her warm and generous advice. Our former First Lady redefined the role in her time here As somebody who is lucky enough to have an extraordinary partner in my life as well, I know how much she meant not just to President Reagan but to the country as a whole. He was lucky to have her. She will be missed. That doesn t exactly sound like a man who didn t personally like or respect Mrs. Reagan. But because President Obama has decided not to attend her funeral on Friday in order to stick to his already tight schedule, conservatives are freaking out and throwing hissy fits despite the fact that this is not new.While Presidents usually attend the funerals of former Presidents, they have historically skipped the funerals of other high ranking officials and First Ladies, often sending the current First Lady to represent them at the service. Michelle Obama is, in fact, attending Nancy Reagan s funeral.President Obama will be taking part in an interview in Texas at the South by Southwest Festival, where he is also scheduled to speak about civic engagement and using technology to address the challenges we face in the future. This was planned prior to Reagan s death.Yet, conservatives see this as a sign of disrespect. The only problem is that he is hardly the first president to skip a funeral for a former First Lady.For instance, President Clinton did not attend Pat Nixon s funeral in 1993 and President Bush did not attend Lady Bird Johnson s funeral in 2007. President Obama also did not attend Betty Ford s funeral in 2011.Jimmy Carter didn t attend Mamie Eisenhower s funeral in 1979 and Franklin D. Roosevelt did not attend Lou Henry Hoover s funeral in 1944.And if conservatives seriously want to refer to Obama as  President Petty,  they should know that Ronald Reagan did not attend Bess Truman s funeral in 1982, and keep in mind that she was First Lady when her husband President Harry Truman ushered in the end of World War II by ordering the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and was the longest lived First Lady in American history.As far as I have been able to research, the only First Ladies whose funerals have been attended by a sitting President in the last 70 years was Eleanor Roosevelt in 1962 and Jacqueline Kennedy in 1994 by President John F. Kennedy and President Bill Clinton respectively.Roosevelt had wanted a small private funeral but Kennedy attended anyway because at the time of her death, Eleanor had been known as the beloved First Lady of the World who served as First Lady during the Great Depression and World War II and is still the longest serving First Lady in American history. Jacqueline Kennedy brought grace to the White House and became a symbol of strength for a traumatized nation after the assassination of her husband in 1963. President Clinton attended her funeral because he was a friend of the family and even delivered remarks at the burial.The bottom line here is that conservatives have nothing to gripe about on this issue. Nancy Reagan s funeral is also a private one and it is quite possible that President Obama was simply not invited to attend and the only reason Michelle Obama will be in attendance is because it is a long tradition that First Ladies attend the funerals of their predecessors just as Presidents attend the funerals of their predecessors.So, there is no reason at all for conservatives to whine about President Obama choosing not to attend Nancy Reagan s funeral. He is not the one being petty.Featured Image: Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It s customary, for sure   and Trump was no exception. He (of course) had nice things to say calling her:  the wife of a truly great president  and  an amazing woman. He s fighting to win the Republican nomination   he has to say these things.Yet   in a bombshell new report that was just dug up by POLITICO and obtained from the archives of columnist Liz Smith s off-the-record interview with Trump in 2004 from The University of Texas at Austin, Trump made some truly nasty comments about her. And   you can bet there s no way he can show his face at her funeral now. If he was invited, he was just uninvited.The transcript runs 68 pages long, but here are the parts of the interview that are truly damaging for Trump:Smith: I ve been invited to go to Ronald Reagan s funeral. I m debating about going.Trump: Do you like her?Smith: I did. I do like her. I think she s .Trump: You know, I respect that she was so loyal.Smith: She s, I don t think she was terribly smart. She s not a smart person.Trump: I never heard that statement that you didn t think she was that smart.Smith: I don t believe she s very smart.Trump: That s very interesting.Smith: She had really trivial .Trump: She was never very beautiful. That s for sure.Smith: No, she wasn t great. She was pretty. But not great.Why Trump thought it was necessary to comment on the former First Lady s appearance is beyond us, but her looks somehow seemed to matter. This is revealing for how Trump views women in general and their worth. Despite what he said about Mrs. Reagan, though, he had nothing but good things to say about Mr. Reagan s appearance. President Reagan, on the other hand, was truly a handsome man. Even though Trump is trying his best to invoke Ronald Reagan s name to gain influence with potential voters, it s probably important to note that Mrs. Reagan herself wasn t a fan of Donald Trump. It s been reported that one of her last words were:  Do not vote for Donald Trump.  If true, the voters aren t listening. And   it s one reason why the GOP has splintered into two and is in the disarray that it s in now.According to a nurse, identified as Althea Thoone, she said: She watched all the [GOP] debates. She was very alert and kept up with all the news and current events, especially about the election. She said no true Republican would cast a vote for Donald Trump.She was not happy at all because I don t believe she thought Donald Trump was a real Republican. She took a turn for the worse after the [11th] debate when he started talking about his private parts, and all that other nonsense about Mitt Romney getting down on his knees. So, nasty comment or not, it doesn t look like Trump would have made a very good guest at the funeral. Hillary Clinton, however, will be there.

If Donald trump is elected, Mrs. Trump will be the first first lady that has ever posed nude; the first first lady that s the third wife [of the president]; and the first foreign-born first lady in this century.

You ve been covering Nancy Reagan, look at what an influencer she was to her husband.   I think posing nude speaks to character,  she said.It s also worth noting that McWilliams seemed to be concerned that Melania Trump is foreign born. She is originally from Slovenia.

With that in mind, you have to wonder if Trump has some kind of multiple personality disorder. On one hand, he completely savages them with rhetoric every chance he gets. On the other, practically every aspect of his business is dependent on them to survive.As if it wasn t embarrassing enough for him to be busted on live TV for producing his overpriced and gaudy clothing in China, now it turns out that the  crown jewel  of his empire   that being real estate development   is also dependent on Chinese money to survive.A Trump-branded luxury apartment building called Trump Bay Street is being built in New Jersey. The project is receiving substantial funds from Chinese investors. Bloomberg reported that the investors were sold on the idea via a  Sopranos  style video campaign filmed from a moving car with the  Work Up This Morning  theme song from the show playing in the background. I didn t know the Sopranos were so big in China.If the fact he pandered out to Chinese investors wasn t hypocritical enough, this next part really takes the cake.The project was also funded to the tune of $50 million by a controversial visa program that essentially sells legal US residency for immigrants who can front a huge wad of cash. The program is called EB-5, and it allows foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in an American project that will create at least 10 jobs to receive a 2-year visa.The program is intensely popular as a capital source for real estate developers and has ballooned from 5 visas in 2005 to 10,692 in 2014. Approximately 1,200 Chinese millionaires essentially bought a visa while millions of regular immigrants wait patiently to come here legally.The EB-5 program has come under a lot of fire as well, for its ability to be easily exploited by unsavory individuals.In addition to reaching wealthy foreign investors, the program has become a magnet for those seeking to sidestep the scrutiny of the traditional immigration process. In one case, immigration officials pushed through a visa application from Chinese investor in a Las Vegas hotel project despite an internal review that found the investor had previously been turned back at the border, and much of his visa application had likely been fabricated, immigration records show.A Feb. 1, 2013 Homeland Security internal review obtained by ABC News also lays out in stark detail the breadth of the troubles afflicting some of the roughly 600 so-called regional centers   private sector entities certified by Homeland Security to recruit foreign investors for specific business ventures that will qualify for EB-5 visas. The document summarizes 41 investigations, some open and some now closed, into allegations ranging from espionage to fraud to drug trafficking involving investors in various EB-5 investment projects.Source: GawkerTrump has been pissing and moaning about China for literally years now and explained how he will mercilessly beat them up in the name of America if elected president.

Most of the programs agreed to Trump s demands, but this response from CBS This Morning s executive producer Chris Licht proved that not everyone was buying it.TwitterSo far, three network sources (who wish to remain anonymous) said they felt Trump s so-called  technical issues  were an  excuse    and when you consider this following statement, it certainly looks like it.

Out of the blue, and with no official statement to the White House, Netanyahu cancelled a trip to Washington and a meeting with the president. The Pope met with the President. The Denver Broncos met with the President. A 106-year-old lady danced with the President. But Netanyahu, a supposed American  ally  in the Middle East will snub him in what is likely the pair s last opportunity to meet face-to-face.Netanyahu didn t even attempt to hide his contempt for Obama, either. Rather than do the respectable thing and give the White House a heads up, the president and his staff learned of Netanyahu s snub from  media outlets like CNN.The White House said Israel had proposed two dates for a meeting between the leaders and the U.S. had offered to meet on one of those days.  We were looking forward to hosting the bilateral meeting,  said Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House s National Security Council.  We were surprised to first learn via media reports that the prime minister, rather than accept our invitation, opted to cancel his visit. Classy.According to Israeli news networks, insiders in the Netanyahu administration told reporters that he was  unwilling to meet with Obama.  However, the Israeli government publicly disputed those reports.Ironically, Netanyahu s own defense for cancelling was so that he did not sway the upcoming U.S. election   something he didn t mind doing in the past. For instance, Netanyahu spoke with Obama on Super Tuesday in 2012. He didn t seem concerned that his actions would throw a wrench in the Democratic process   or perhaps more accurately, he rather hoped it would. And two years later during the mid-term elections, his love for Republicans was so obvious, that it was discussed with casual openness in Israel. Here, for example, is a typical report from the time.It s no secret that Netanyahu and his aides are praying for control of the U.S. Senate to fall to the Republicans, who already hold the majority of the House of Representatives. Based on recent U.S. polls, there s a fairly good chance those prayers will be answered. However, Netanyahu won t break open any champagne prematurely. He did that two years ago, before the presidential elections, only to see his favored candidate, Mitt Romney, lose to incumbent President Barack Obama.Unfortunately for the prime minister, he got his wish and still lost the battle. They really tried, but Republicans were unable to stop the Iranian nuclear agreement   even after skirting America s treason laws to try to elbow their way in.It seems apparent that the Israeli Prime Minister is still livid over the fact that Obama went ahead with the Iranian nuclear disarmament instead of listening to his calls for war. The two world leaders have never exactly seen eye-to-eye on the issue of Iran or anything else. Netanyahu, a right-wing hardliner, has resented Obama s calls for peace, including chastising Israel for its policies towards Palestinians. The fact that the United States still provides financial and military support to Israel to the tune of billions of dollars a year doesn t seem to calm him down, either.So rather than swallow his pride, Netanyahu has resorted to shameful displays of pettiness. What that means for the future of U.S.-Israel relations will be better known after the election.Featured image via Flickr ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The Second Amendment is not limitless, just as the First Amendment is not limitless. There are limits to speech and religion when it causes harm to others, just as it should be with the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms. It should also be noted that the militias were to be formed and armed to be used by the government, not against (see also: Whiskey Rebellion).However, the gun industry alongside the gun lobby continuously seeks to change the meaning behind the Second Amendment to suit their needs and desire to make more profit. In their latest scheme at lobbying Congress, gun advocates are asking Congress to  repeal a Depression-era law that requires a months-long screening process for silencer buyers.   You know, because people need to make their guns quieter.Oh, but they don t call them  silencers,  they call them  suppressors,  and their reasoning for the need to get them to everyone is pure gold. Apparently, not only hunters need them, but so does everyone else  to protect from  hearing loss. Yep, you read that correctly, the gun industry is trying to rebrand these  suppressors as  hearing-protection accessories.  Republican Congressman Matt Salmon, from the great state of Arizona, who is clearly bought and paid for by the gun lobby, stated: If we have something that mitigates that kind of hearing loss, we ought to be encouraging it. How about less gun use. Or is that too obvious?Salmon s law, called the  Hearing Protection Act, seeks to  remove sound suppressors from regulation under the National Firearms Act (NFA), leaving them to be treated as ordinary firearms subject to the usual NICS check and Form 4473 for dealer sales. Common sense Democratic State Rep. Joe Mullery from Minnesota, said: What legitimate reason does a person have to be wandering around the streets of a big city with a silencer? None. There is no reason anyone should have a silencer unless they are in the military and need one for a specific task.And as the gun industry likes to point out that there aren t very many crimes committed with suppressors, they fail to realize that it s probably because they aren t regularly available and are harder to get, as they should be. That s the whole point. Thanks for making it for us. Now, if we could only do that for all guns. In Augusta, Maine, police chief Robert Gregoire said silencer-equipped gunshots may sound further away than a typical gunshot, making it hard to track hunters in unauthorized areas. Also, he now cannot block silencer sales for residents he suspects may not use them responsibly.A hunter himself, Gregoire said he saw little reason to encourage silencer use. I don t think they re necessary for home protection and I don t think they re necessary for hunting,  he said. source: The GuardianYet, Congressman Salmon, alongside 51 supporters of his  Hearing Protection Act,  are fighting alongside the NRA and the gun lobby to make silencers readily available for all guns and gun purchasers.

The poor woman whose father saw fit to advertise for a husband for her in a creepy religious publication and wave the fact that she is in her mid-twenties and a virgin around like that was something to be extremely proud of also happens to be a blogger. While the ad included her blog s URL, we will not be doing that here, lest other creepy misogynists try to hit her up. Further, she was smart enough not to make the blog public. Also, the woman, called  Rachel,  is not too torn up over it, and seems to be okay. She wrote of her fathers gross antics: I m just nervous if this doesn t work out, next I ll find my face plastered on a billboard. Oh gosh, now I m giving him ideas. The prizing of virginity is one of the most gross, inappropriate, and misogynist parts of Abrahamic religions. Just another reason to question these people and their idea of what morality is.Get out of that cult of a religion, Rachel, while you still can. Good luck to you   you ll definitely need it.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Unfortunately, when watching the GOP debates, you re not going to find any of those qualities, at least amongst the front-runners.At the most recent debate, the subject of  hand  size was literally brought up, and of course,  hand size  is actually the size of their dicks, because of course that s what these guys would be talking about. Noticing how utterly ridiculous not only bringing this subject up is, but also finding it humorous that Donald Trump in particular took such offense in what appears to be major overcompensation, Ellen DeGeneres of The Ellen Show showed us a better interpretation of what his  hand size  actually may be.In a modified clip of the most recent debate, Ellen had Trump s hands photoshopped into tiny little baby hands. He still waved them around like he has something to prove, but this time, it was seemingly far more accurate.Truth be told, we don t need a person obsessed with proving how  large  or  great  they personally are. We don t need someone who uses  I,   me,  or  my  every other sentence. Running for president is running to serve the citizens of the United States, not yourself.

In the video, Trump creepily sits alone in a dark room for three minutes and defends his beloved  university    despite the fact that even he himself has admitted that it was a scam.Specifically calling out two former attendees of the  University  who have publicly stated that they were ripped off, the business mogul made a disturbing threat that shows just how shady he is when it comes to his business endeavors: cross me and I will name you so my insane Twitter followers can harass you.Trump went as far as to hold up supposed positive evaluation forms from the two fraud victims named in the video, stating that their forms would be used in court. He said, When they are on the stand, they will be shown and shown [sic] these reports. Why would anybody settle a case when we have reports like this? I just can t do it. Trump s message gets even weirder when he compares his battle against the fraud charges to America, although it s not really clear what the hell he means. Trump said: And you know what?

A main cause of the rise of extremism in the world of Islam has been the cowardice of Muslim moderates who, for decades, chose not to condemn bad ideas and ugly rhetoric,  Zakaria said, clearly referencing the fact that moderate Republicans here at home allowed conservative extremism, or Christian Sharia law, to fester within the party until it turned into a full blown infection that threatens to kill the party and ruin America. Fearing that they would be seen simply as ideological weaklings, they avoided confronting the cancer in plain sight. It is now clear that a similar dynamic has been at play in the world of conservatism,  he continued.Zakaria then praised Mitt Romeny for condemning Trump, but criticized him for taking too long to do so and for gratefully accepting Trump s endorsement in 2012 even though he was still the face of the birther movement. What is different about the conservative movement,  Zakaria says, is that  some of its mainstream members have embraced the rhetoric and tactics of the extremes. He then noted that it was Newt Gingrich who began this shift in the 1990s by circulating a memo calling for Republicans to smear Democrats with words such as  failure, pathetic, disgrace, and incompetent,  all of which have been used by Trump during this current election.Zaharia then destroyed the Republican notion that President Obama is at fault for Trump s rise within the GOP and offered a better explanation: Republicans have fed the country ideas, decline, betrayal, and treason. They have encouraged the forces of anti-intellectualism, obstructionism, and populism. They have flirted with bigotry and racism. Trump merely chose to unashamedly to embrace all of it, saying plainly what they were hinting at for years. In doing so, he hit the jackpot. The problem is not that Republican leaders should have begun to condemn Trump last year, it is that they should have condemned the ideas and tactics that led to his rise when they began to flourish in the last century. Here s the video via YouTube.In other words, moderate Republicans should apologize for waiting so long to call out the extremism within their own party and now it s just a question of whether this extremism can be defeated before it is too late.Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The 19-month-old died after two weeks of rapidly worsening illness without medical attention.The couple, David and Collet Stephan, are Mormons who run a nutritional supplement company in the United States. They were charged with the death of their child and face up to five years in prison if convicted.Sadly, the death of this toddler didn t come from ignorance, but from the malicious anti-vaccination movement, which deliberately spreads false information about medical practices and advocates in favor of unproven  natural  cures that alternate between the effectiveness of a placebo and down-right harm. Tapes played for the court featured Collet Stephan telling officers that a nurse friend pleaded with the couple about their son s illness, telling them it was a life-threatening case of meningitis. Rather than heed the nurse s warnings, the couple opted for home-brew concoctions.In a bid to boost his immune system, the couple gave the boy who was lethargic and becoming stiff   various home remedies, such as water with maple syrup, juice with frozen berries and finally a mixture of apple cider vinegar, horse radish root, hot peppers, mashed onion, garlic and ginger root as his condition deteriorated.Court heard the couple on tape explaining to the police officer that they prefer naturopathic remedies because of their family s negative experiences with the medical system.Perhaps most disturbingly, the couple continues to maintain that they did nothing wrong. On social media and in comments to the court, the Stephans have shown nothing but contempt for the judicial process. In the aftermath of his son s death, David has accused the government of attempting to force families like his to vaccinate their children. The fact that the child died because the government didn t force him to vaccinate his children is a point that seems to have eluded him.As other cases have done in the past, the plight of the Stephans and the victimization of their children (yes, they have other   unvaccinated   children still living with them), reminds us that this is not just an intellectual exercise or an example of the government overstepping its role. The anti-vaxxer movement, and its supporters, are putting the lives of real children at risk when they opt for maple syrup remedies over scientifically-tested medical care. No child should have to die because of their parents bad decision-making. And the parents should be held accountable for those decisions as well.Featured image via CBC/Facebook ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The thing that people don t actually know is, it s someone else s huge penis and Trump just licenses his name on it.

As long as that vote doesn t go against the people who actually control the party, in which case they will disregard your vote, replace it with their vote   and then, every vote will count.

The rich have gotten richer and the poor have only gotten poorer as the once mighty and prosperous American middle class is disappearing. The problem with the Republican Party over the past 30 years is they haven t   and I ll say, we haven t   developed a message that appeals to the working class Americans economically in a way that Donald Trump s does,  Scarborough said. We talk about cutting capital gains taxes that the 10,000 people that in the crowd cheering for Donald Trump, they are never going to get a capital gains cut because it doesn t apply. We talk about getting rid of the death tax. The death tax is not going to impact the 10,000 people in the crowd for Donald Trump. We talk about how great free trade deals are. Those free trade deals never trickle down to those 10,000 people in Donald Trump s rallies. And then the former Republican lawmaker actually flat-out admitted that trickle down hasn t worked. But herein lies the problem with the Republican Party. It never trickles down! Those people in Trump s crowds, those are all the ones that lost the jobs when they get moved to Mexico and elsewhere. The Republican donor class are the ones that got rich off of it because their capital moved overseas and they made higher profits What we re finding this year is, they ll even support a guy who says Planned Parenthood is good if he comes with an economic approach that they feel could actually help them more in the future. Here s the video via YouTube:And Scarborough is absolutely right. For decades, Republicans have told the American people that their economic concerns will be all taken care of as long as we eliminate taxes on the wealthy. But all that trickle down economics has caused is Americans losing their jobs overseas and they never see a dime of the wealth the GOP promised would trickle down upon them. It s like saying apples will fall from a tree if you just wait long enough but by the time one does fall it s rotten to the core and worthless. And that s if the tree doesn t just keep all the apples for itself like the wealthy are currently keeping all the money to themselves.The fact is that trickle down economics is a failed economic policy that needs to be ditched in favor of one that actually helps the American people. It s time for the rich to start paying their fair share and it s time for the middle class to rise again and take back the wealth that has been stolen by Republicans and their wealthy puppet masters.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It has left her looking as if she is completely out of touch with the community she says she wants to be a part of. Last year, on Ellen, she even went as far as to say that she doesn t not believe in same-sex marriage. After the incredible amount of backlash she received from those comments, you d think she would have stayed as far away from her GOP cheerleading as possible, but apparently she s not very bright (typical Republican).During the episode, the right-winger voiced a completely asinine opinion about Hillary Clinton: If we re unfortunate enough to get Hillary as our next president, we need her on our side,  Jenner told her friends.  Although she won t be   she couldn t care less about women. She only cares about herself. What?Hillary Clinton has been a longtime supporter of women s rights. While Jenner s Republican buddies have fought tooth and nail to implant their elephants in women s uteri, Hillary has stood up for us   along with the rest of the Democratic Party. Anybody who disputes this has clearly not been paying attention. Maybe Jenner believes that the only way to support women is by making our health care choices for us, limiting our rights, fighting against equal pay and every other dig the GOP has taken at us because they think we are all stupid.As if her Clinton comment wasn t ignorant enough, what she said about the Republican Party was mindblowing: All of  em.   None of the Republicans [say],  Oh, I hate trans people  or  I hate gays.  Nothing like that, They do more,  I want a thriving economy so every trans person has a job.'

They just say things like this:Oh yeah, those certainly sound like comments from people who believe in protecting  everybody s rights,  don t they?This is why the trans and LGB community doesn t trust Jenner.

Even more amazingly, despite having zero concern for the safety of anyone else on the road, Turman managed not to kill anyone, although she did blow through an intersection and almost hit four cars in the process.The police called off their pursuit, presumably to allow Turman to stop fleeing in a blind panic and to avoid a fatal car accident. Instead, they followed her with a helicopter:The CHP helicopter kept surveillance of Turman s vehicle as she continued west toward Highway 36, where she was spotted abandoning the vehicle in northwestern Tehama County.

The country started out with six justices, we ve had as many as ten at some point in time,  he continued.  As recently as 2010, when Justice Elena Kagan came on the Court, she had been solicitor general so she recused herself in over a third of the cases (so) I don t see a sense of urgency. I fully expect this to be repeated over and over again and eventually mimicked by the corporate media. If there s one thing besides crippling America that the GOP is really good at, it s making their sabotage seem perfectly normal. The corporate media is always a willing accomplice to this charade as they will tie themselves into knots to avoid calling out the historic extremism of the right.A side benefit of using this kind of rhetoric to keep the 9th seat empty for so long is that when a Democrat wins in November, they ll already have normalized a reduced Court. It s like stacking the Court, adding seats to dilute the power of one set of Justices, but in reverse.On the flip side, if Republicans were to somehow win in November, I wouldn t be at all surprised if they suddenly  realized  that 9 Justices just aren t enough and we really should have 11, 7 of whom would just happen to be conservative.

The couple has since split up, but both individuals are still parents to their children, as it would be with any heterosexual couple. However, the entire thing does start to get very confusing.Here s the run down via NPR: The two women in the case were together for 16 years, and they had three children conceived by assisted reproductive technology   an older daughter, now 13, and boy and girl twins, now 11. The actual names of the parents have not been revealed. They are identified in court documents by the initials V.L. and E.L.E.L. was the biological mother and V.L. subsequently adopted the children with her partner s explicit consent. The adoption was in Georgia, where both women appeared at a court hearing, and the final adoption decree recognized both as the children s legal parents.When the parents, now living in Alabama, split five years ago, however, the biological mother denied her former partner access to the children. The Alabama courts initially ordered a decree of shared custody, based on the Georgia adoption, but the Alabama Supreme Court overturned the lower court orders. The state Supreme Court said the Georgia courts had wrongly agreed to the adoption.The adoptive mother appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and on Monday the justices unanimously overruled the Alabama Supreme Court in a short, unsigned opinion. Now, all of that aside, let s just get it out there that this was a frickin terrible thing to do, and as a lesbian myself, to see a woman use anti-gay laws against her former partner as a means to try to keep her away from her own children is pretty much the lowest of the low. But I digress Thankfully, the Court sided with the mother who had adoptive rights in Georgia with the argument was brought up where according to the Constitution in Article IV, Section 1, where the Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.  Basically, what s good for the goose, better damn well be good for the gander, and all states need to respect legal acts and proceedings from other states.  According to Cathy Sakimura of the National Center for Lesbian Rights: The Supreme Court s reversal of Alabama s unprecedented decision to void an adoption from another state is a victory not only for our client but for thousands of adopted families. No adoptive parent or child should have to face the uncertainty and loss of being separated years after their adoption just because another state s court disagrees with the law that was applied in their adoption. This decision could affect up to 30 different states, according to a brief that was  submitted by adoption and child welfare agencies. If we re going to have marriage equality, then that equality needs to reach across all levels of the law. This should include, but not be limited to, adoption, and worker s rights as well. No one should be fired for being gay, which currently is still allowed in 28 states. It s 2016, people, gay rights are human rights.

The  baby parts  lie fabricated by two felons at the deceptively-named Center for Medical Progress has been mindlessly parroted throughout right-wing media that they are now claiming the women s health organization violates federal law by performing later-term abortions in order to sell  baby parts. On Monday, O Reilly Factor, the discussion turned to Hillary Clinton s statement on abortion at the Fox News Town Hall. Asked whether she supports late-term abortions, Clinton said that it should be an option if the life and health of the mother is at risk. While this would seem sensible to even most adamantly anti-abortion individuals, Fox contributor Katie Pavlich naturally idiotsplained that Clinton is as evil as the most infected cyst on Satan s behind. She was asked specifically about late-term abortion and there was an incredible poll that came out in January showing 80 percent of Americans, including 80 percent of women, think late-term abortion should be banned,  Pavlich said, ignoring that Clinton had explained that the exception only pertained to saving the mother s life.Juan Williams pointed out that Planned Parenthood is very popular in the United States, but Pavlich had a dirty little secret to drop for her incredibly stupid crowd:Does she have any evidence to back her claim? Of course not   numerous investigations failed to prove that Planned Parenthood had  sold  a single baby part. The organization did accept reimbursement for expenses, but it is a crime to actually profit from fetal tissue sale. After the Right foamed at the mouth over the fake  controversy  surrounding Planned Parenthood, the organization stopped accepting reimbursement altogether to appease the Stupid Part of America.While it is obvious that the gerbils that operate Pavlich s brain are having difficulties overcoming such a baffling level of stupidity, you might be wondering: is this a work slowdown, or did they just say f*ck it and go on strike? Does Planned Parenthood even perform late-term abortions?They don t. During the  baby parts  witch hunt,  Richards was clear that the organization does not perform late-term abortions. Politico reported at the time:When late-term abortions came up, Richards maintained that Planned Parenthood doesn t perform abortions past viability. But as the National Right to Life Committee points out,  Planned Parenthood clinics advertise and perform abortions well into the second trimester, even up to 24 weeks,  while research says about a quarter of infants born at 22 weeks survive.Richards professed to have never heard of a baby surviving an abortion, even though survivors have testified before Congress. She said a baby born alive after an attempted abortion should get medical care   a significant concession given people on her side of the abortion debate, including Barack Obama in Illinois, have previously opposed legislation to protect born-alive infants.That s right. Thanks to the continuous strain and lackluster benefits involved with operating Pavlich s thinkie-thingie and after numerous on-the-job deaths, the little critters in her head are refusing to work. Rumor has it that they are demanding more break time, paid lunch, a raise, and better healthcare, and that Pavlich refuses   the only explanation for the words that just came out of her mouth.Visibly perplexed that a human being can be this utterly ignorant, Williams shot back: This is exactly where I think Republicans go off the rails. The people who tried to argue that Planned Parenthood was selling baby parts, they got indicted. In Texas. In a red state. For violating people s rights and for making up stuff.

Romney lost Latinos by 44%,   an increase from the 2008 margin of 36%, which was a huge jump from John Kerry s advantage with those voters of only 9% in 2004. It was a disaster. And in that same time Latinos have gone from 8% of voters to 10% of voters in 2012, and that is expected to continue rising.And now along comes Trump. Thanks to his blatantly racist rhetoric and attacks on Latinos, it now appears that Latino immigrants are signing up to become American citizens just to stick it to the current Republican front runner.Over all, naturalization applications increased by 11 percent in the 2015 fiscal year over the year before, and jumped 14 percent during the six months ending in January, according to federal figures. The pace is picking up by the week, advocates say, and they estimate applications could approach 1 million in 2016, about 200,000 more than the average in recent years.While naturalizations generally rise during presidential election years, Mr. Trump provided an extra boost this year.Trump started his campaign by calling Mexicans drug traffickers and rapists, and it has only gotten worse as the national spotlight has shone on his campaign. He s gone after blacks, Muslims, women, and Asians among others. But his campaign of hate against Latinos has been non-stop, even targeting the current and former presidents of Mexico.And his target audience has responded. Trump fans have beaten up Latinos, while citing their hero for their motivation, as children have begun using Trump s rhetoric about building a wall on the southern border in order to insult Latino kids.The Republicans have turned a blind eye to racial intolerance for a long time, choosing to court the support of racists in close elections while pretending not to hear their hate speech.

I just don t think it s in the best interest of the state of West Virginia to sign this bill,  Tomblin said.  When you re a police officer and you walk into a dangerous situation, you almost have to expect that everyone s carrying a gun. But in their gun crazy fervor, Republicans decided to override that veto on Friday, thus dismantling a critical program that had kept the mentally ill and convicted felons from getting concealed carry permits. Now they ll be able to carry their gun in public among innocent people who could end up being killed by someone who shouldn t be able to have a gun in the first place.As previously mentioned, West Virginia law enforcement officials strongly opposed eliminating the system that has served the state well over the years.According to West Virginia Metro News,Kent Carper, president of the Kanawha County Commission, was one of several officials who expressed concern about the bill that, he said, fails to protect police officers. Do we seriously want to send our law enforcement officials out and take away any chance they have to come home safely?  he said.  These men and women protect us. Over the last few years, Carper said more than 173 county residents were denied gun permits. (It was) for people that had mental problems, people that were convicted felons, drug dealers. Do we really want to take away a sensible protection for our law enforcement?  he said.County Sheriff Steve Tanner blasted Republicans for being irresponsible. I don t know how we as a society can say it s OK for someone to carry a concealed weapon with absolutely no training and expect if something bad happens, they re going to be the hero to rush in to protect their family or strangers. It has got to be the law that people are required to have training before they carry. Here s the report by 13 News via YouTube:Republicans literally just made it legal for mentally unstable people and convicted felons to carry concealed weapons and there is nothing police officers can do about it except wear bullet proof vests on a daily basis and hope they don t end up becoming a target or the victim of gunfire by an idiot attempting to be Rambo.Conservatives constantly claim that they support police officers. But now Republicans in West Virginia have made it clear that they don t care if police officers have a higher chance of being gunned down by a right-wing gun nut. They certainly don t care about the millions of innocent people who now have to worry about whether the rambling crazy person standing around is going to open fire any minute. Or worse, parents will now have to worry about their children in school because the new law allows concealed carry everywhere, meaning anyone could walk into a school with a gun and the police can t do anything about it until the shooting starts. And even if there is a so-called  good guy with a gun  around, it s very likely they won t be trained, which means innocent people could be killed by the wannabe hero.If you live in West Virginia, think about that next time you send your child off to school or watch your police officer spouse head off to work. Because the chances that you ll never see them alive again just skyrocketed. All because Republicans are gun crazy.Featured Image: Pixabay""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

If he had decided to run, it would have undoubtedly split the vote, and could have in turn resulted in Donald Trump being president.In an editorial on Bloomberg View, the former mayor wrote: Over the last several months, many Americans have urged me to run for president as an independent, and some who don t like the current candidates have said it is my patriotic duty to do so. I appreciate their appeals, and I have given the question serious consideration. The deadline to answer it is now, because of ballot access requirements. But when I look at the data, it s clear to me that if I entered the race, I could not win. I believe I could win a number of diverse states   but not enough to win the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win the presidency. Bloomberg Politics pointed out: In order to win, Bloomberg would have had to win pluralities in enough states to capture 270 electoral votes. The Constitution also provides for the election to be thrown into the House of Representatives to decide if no candidate can secure those votes, though that method has been used only twice, after the elections in 1800 and 1824. That body is controlled by a Republican majority. It would be almost certain the Republican nominated would ve won the presidency by any way the votes tallied.This was a very smart move on behalf of Bloomberg, putting country before his personal want to be the next Commander-in Chief. It s looking more and more like Trump will be the Republican nominee and Clinton the Democratic. Bloomberg seems to realize that in order for the Democratic candidate to win in the general election they are going to need all the votes they can get.

While expressing his sentiments for the late First Lady Nancy Reagan, Powell mentioned that he felt she would be  disturbed  by the way the current GOP candidates claim to keep her husband s legacy alive.Powell should know   he was Reagan s national security adviser   and recalled that the former president acted with the utmost  civility  and lacked any of the  nastiness  the party s current presidential candidates possess. He called out the childish behavior and bickering that accompanies every single Republican debate, comparing them to The Jerry Springer Show: To stand there and do junior high school tricks on one another I think is belittling the country and belittling the office to which they are striving to gain. And I hope they start realizing as amusing as it might be, and this is realty television, even Jerry Springer thinks it s gone too far, and when Jerry Springer thinks you ve gone too far, my friends, you have gone too far. Powell was referencing the fact that Jerry Springer, who was the Democratic mayor of Cincinnati in the 1970s before hosting his drama-filled talk show, had recently decried the GOP debates and said that  Our show is a circus, but the presidency of the United States is not supposed to be a circus. Powell s words of wisdom to the GOP?:  We have to become more respectful of each other    a message that the candidates are probably not mature enough to internalize. You can listen to the NPR interview below:But Powell s message doesn t stop with the NPR interview. He also shared a similar message Monday morning with CBS, saying that the Republican  campaign has gone into the mud.  He said: The comments that they re making toward each other, the nastiness, it s running us into the ground. The foreigners of the world, looking at this, are distressed. You can watch that interview below:While Powell has supported President Barack Obama for both of his terms, Powell insisted that he is still a Republican but that he will  always vote for the person who I think is best for America at that time. Powell has criticized the GOP before. During Obama s first term, the former secretary of state said, In 2008, I spoke out against calling the president a Muslim as if that was a curse. I don t know anything in the Constitution that says Muslims are bad.  In 2012, Powell once again opposed a level of intolerance in some parts of the party   and there was. And I think there still is. Powell has not said that he is endorsing any specific Republican candidate at this time, or that he is criticizing any particular candidate with his remarks. Either way, his message certainly applies to every single one of them.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

However, the world seems to be united against he possibility of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. Several foreign diplomats have issued statements declaring their concern.According to Reuters: Officials from Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia have complained in recent private conversations, mostly about the xenophobic nature of Trump s statements, said three U.S. officials, who all declined to be identified. With one of the officials stating: As the [Trump] rhetoric has continued, and in some cases amped up, so, too, have concerns by certain leaders around the world. Reuters explains: U.S. officials said it was highly unusual for foreign diplomats to express concern, even privately, about candidates in the midst of a presidential campaign. U.S. allies in particular usually don t want to be seen as meddling in domestic politics, mindful that they will have to work with whoever wins.Senior leaders in several countries   including Britain, Mexico, France, and Canada   have already made public comments criticizing Trump s positions. German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel branded him a threat to peace and prosperity in an interview published on Sunday. With Trump s consistent racist and xenophobic talk and tactics that are borderline fascist and totalitarian, it is easy to see why so many worldwide are deeply concerned. One senior NATO official said: European diplomats are constantly asking about Trump s rise with disbelief and, now, growing panic. With the EU facing an existential crisis, there s more than the usual anxiety about the U.S. turning inward when Europe needs U.S. support more than ever. Just last week,  more than 90 Republican foreign policy veterans have pledged to oppose Donald Trump, saying his proposals would undermine U.S. security, in the latest sign of fissures between the Republican presidential front-runner and the party establishment. It has been clear that not only Democrats don t want Trump, but also Republicans and pretty much the entire world. We, as voters, need to make sure that Trump gets nowhere near the Oval Office, not even on a White House tour.

Jobs were being lost at the rate of 750K per month, but have made consistent gains throughout all of Obama s tenure as Commander-in-Chief. Part of bringing us back from the worst recession since the Great Depression included several Wall Street reforms and a Credit Card Bill of Rights.Clearly, we ve come along way from the financial crisis that took place from 2007-2009, and sure, we have a long way to go to ensure that sort of crisis doesn t happen again, but President Obama had some choice words for those who claim he s been soft on Wall Street.On Monday, while standing with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and several other top regulators, the president stated: I want to emphasize this because it is popular in the media and the political discourse, both on the left and the right, to suggest that the crisis happened and nothing happened. That is not true. I want to dispel the notion that exists both on the left and on the right that somehow, after the crisis, nothing happened. We did not just rebuild this, we rebuilt it better, and we ve rebuilt it stronger. According to Reuters: Obama said regulators appear set by the end of the year to have achieved most of the goals he set out for the financial system in 2008, when he first took office, although he noted there was still work to do on rules for hedge funds and asset managers in what he called the  shadow banking system. He then explained why that work hasn t been done yet: One of our projects is to make sure that we are covering some of those potential gaps. We may need at some point help from Congress to do that. Which is exactly right. In order for those gaps to be filled we need Congress to cooperate, and it s not enough to just blame leadership, we have to hold our Congresspeople accountable. That s why elections, and not just presidential elections, matter so much. Republicans want to weaken regulations and make it possible for the practices that caused the financial crisis to occur, to create a future crisis. If anything, we need to embrace and expand President Obama ideas and goals on Wall Street, not condemn them.

Fifty years after the salute was first used to pledge allegiance to the flag, Congress changed it because it had been adopted by the Nazis as a salute of allegiance to Adolf Hitler.As we all know, Hitler tried to exterminate the Jews by placing them in concentration camps such as Auschwitz, resulting in the mass murder of six million Jews during what became known as the Holocaust.If anyone knows what Nazi Germany and Hitler was like, it s Holocaust survivors, of which there only only a few hundred left.Abraham Foxman is one of those survivors. Though only a child at the time, Foxman was saved by his Catholic nanny. His parents, however, were forced to live in a ghetto. After being returned to his parents in 1944, Foxman and his parents came to the United States in 1950 to start fresh far away from war-torn Europe.But Foxman fears the United States is beginning to look a lot like Nazi Germany and it s mainly because of Donald Trump.After witnessing Trump call for thousands of supporters to raise their right hands to pledge allegiance to him during a recent rally in Florida, Foxman, the former head of the Anti-Defamation League, told the Times of Israel that the event disturbed him because it eerily reminded him of the Third Reich. As a Jew who survived the Holocaust, to see an audience of thousands of people raising their hands in what looks like the  Heil Hitler  salute is about as offensive, obnoxious and disgusting as anything I thought I would ever witness in the United States of America. We ve seen this sort of thing at rallies of neo-Nazis. We ve seen it at rallies of white supremacists. But to see it at a rally for a legitimate candidate for the presidency of the United States is outrageous. Foxman then discussed what Trump said after asking his audience to raise their hands. Don t forget you all raised your hands,  Trump said.  You swore. Bad things happen if you don t live up to what you just did. It is a fascist gesture,  Foxman said. He is smart enough   he always tells us how smart he is   to know the images that this evokes. Instead of asking his audience to pledge allegiance to the United States of America, which in itself would be a little bizarre, he s asking them to swear allegiance to him. He even threatens that if they don t, they will suffer and be punished. This is so over the top for a man who really doesn t come out of the underground. He is a man of the world. Even though he proclaims he doesn t know who David Duke was, or the other white supremacists, we know very well that he knows. So he s playing to an image. But despite his obscene extremism, which would have immediately disqualified candidates in the past, Trump is riding this wave of hate all the way to the Republican nomination. And the GOP establishment is so afraid of him actually being their nominee that there is talk of replacing Trump with someone else during the convention in July.As for Foxman, he is genuinely frightened of the possibility that right-wing extremism will keep growing and carry Trump to the White House. You can find some authoritarian, semi-fascist tinges in Southern politics during the segregationist era. But there s never been anything like this, and nothing on this scale. I am a Holocaust survivor and this made me quiver. What scares me is he s broken all these taboos and it s helped him. That frightens me. It frightens me that there are all these things that we ve worked so hard on, but one after another he breaks these taboos and the people applaud him and come back for more. Americans need to start taking this election seriously, because if Holocaust survivors are being reminded of one of the greatest evils this world has ever witnessed because of Trump s campaign to be the most powerful person on this Earth, we should be scared of him, too.

Knowing the stakes are four years of an anti-immigrant bigot in the White House has led to many Latino immigrants who may have been putting off getting their citizenship to get it in a hurry. They want to ensure their voices are heard on election day.It should be noted that those seeking citizenship are mostly legal immigrants who are living in the United States. But unlike Republican voters, they understand that Trump s anti-immigrant message means bigotry towards all minorities, not just the undocumented. Indeed, many of Trump s supporters seem to have little clue that Latinos can be legal citizens. So if it comes down to Trump vs. the Democratic candidate, the choice is clear. As as one Latino resident told the New York Times while filling out her citizenship application: I want to vote so Donald Trump won t win. He doesn t like us. That s an understatement.You may remember that this is the exact opposite of what Republicans were hoping to achieve in 2016. Following the disastrous 2012 election which saw Republicans getting hammered by nearly every demographic but old white men, the party had hoped to soften its stance towards the growing Latino population. Instead, the toxic underbelly of the party rejected the cries for tolerance and ran head first towards the candidate they felt was most in line with white supremacy: Donald J. Trump. A lot of people are opening their eyes because of all the negative stuff Donald Trump has brought,  said Ms. Villegas s husband, Miguel Garf o, 30, who was born and raised in Colorado and came to the workshop here to help his wife and other family members become citizens this year. His parents came from Mexico in the 1980s and worked hard all their lives, he said, helping him create a construction company in Denver that now employs 18 people. Contrary to Mr. Trump s depiction, he said, none of his relatives have criminal records. [Source]And in a move that highlights how Democrats are embracing immigrants where Republicans are rejecting them, the Obama administration is working closely with nonprofit groups around the country to help put immigrants on the path to citizenship. This would seem like a good thing. After all, Republicans have repeatedly said they don t mind immigrants as long as they go through the proper channels. But that talking point seems to have gone up in flames. Rather than celebrate the White House s efforts, it has outraged Republicans, who have worked hard to prevent as many people   mostly among demographics that lean Democratic   from voting as possible.Despite these signs that Republicans are again on the path to an epic shellacking on election day thanks to their message of bigotry, Trump has the delusional sense that Latinos  love  him. He promised Republicans that he would  do really well with Hispanics.  He s nothing if not painfully optimistic.Featured image via U.S. Citizenship""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Husted is distorting the language surrounding the rule which allowed 17-year-olds to vote early by alleging the 17-year-olds can nominate a candidate, but not elect one for office.The Secretary of State before Jon Husted, Jennifer Brunner, allowed 17-year-olds to participate in the 2008 primary election.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Yes, this actually happened.During a panel discussion on Meet The Press on Sunday, Detroit Free Press reporter Stephen Henderson explained how Republicans are not believable when they try to distance themselves from Donald Trump s racist hate speech because they have been doing it for decades in coded language and through the policies they push.There s also a substantive credibility problem here,  Henderson said. I mean, you have Republicans saying,  Trump is not one of us.  And yet, a lot of the things that he s saying are said in coded language by other Republicans. I wrote a column last week about Paul Ryan, for instance, saying,  This is not a party that preys on people s prejudices. And yet, you can think of lots of examples of Republicans doing exactly that, going back to Ronald Reagan, giving a states  rights speech in Neshoba County, Mississippi, in 1980. This goes on all the time in coded ways. Trump is saying some of these things more explicitly. And that makes them, you know, it makes you uncomfortable too And that made the old conservative white lady next to Henderson angry, so she expressed her desire to choke him because how dare he call out Republicans for being racist, and what about all those poor white supremacists who people unfairly refer to as bigots? No, it doesn t make me uncomfortable, it just makes me want to choke you because it s ridiculous and it s the creation of Trump,  said former Reagan and George W. Bush consultant Mary Matalin. Because conservatives do not consider themselves bigots or homophobes or misogynists, okay? What Cruz won at CPAC, and he won overwhelmingly, he is expanding the electorate by bringing like-minded libertarians, young people. Trump is expanding the electorate by getting people who are sick of being called bigots, because they want to secure the border. This is not a race race, okay? Let s not go there. Let that sink in for a second. Matalin actually expects us to believe that conservatives are not the racist, sexist homophobes that we all see them as   even though they have persecuted gays with anti-gay laws and hateful rhetoric, persecuted women with draconian laws meant to take away a woman s right to make decisions about their own reproductive health along with denying women pay equality, and have made it quite clear that they hate black people due to the way they have treated the first black president over the last seven years. And that s just the tip of the iceberg.Henderson laughed at Matalin s desire to choke him, however, it didn t sound like she was joking. But he responded anyway, in disagreement, of course. I think it is. I mean, I think there s no question that what he is doing is appealing to race. And Republicans have done that for a long time. Here s the video via Crooks and Liars.I m sure the Republican Party is pleased that at least one of their pawns is still brainwashed enough to believe that conservatives are somehow a diverse lot who care about the plight of women, minorities, and gay people even though the GOP has done nothing to help any of these groups. All they have done is attack them in an effort to take away their rights, and if they had their way, Henderson wouldn t be allowed to speak unless a white person gave him permission to do so.

Science deals in facts, creationism deals in fantasy. So when the peer-reviewed, scientific journal PLOS ONE recently published a paper that claimed God designed our hands, the backlash was swift and loud.The paper was written by a team of scientists from China and Worcester, Massachusetts in order to better understand hand coordination. The abstract states, It is not understood which biomechanical characteristics are responsible for hand coordination and what specific effect each biomechanical characteristic has.  But the abstract also contained something that made PLOS readers (and, at least, one editor) so angry the journal eventually retracted the paper, it said:The explicit functional link indicates that the biomechanical characteristic of tendinous connective architecture between muscles and articulations is the proper design by the Creator to perform a multitude of daily tasks in a comfortable way.The body of the paper mentions  the Creator  two more times, and the conclusion said:In conclusion, our study can improve the understanding of the human hand and confirm that the mechanical architecture is the proper design by the Creator for dexterous performance of numerous functions following the evolutionary remodeling of the ancestral hand for millions of years.WOW. Pretty outrageous right? How in the world did a scientific journal allow that to slip by them? Well, that s exactly what PLOS  readers wanted to know. According to Vox:On the PLOS website, many angry readers called for the retraction of the article or an amendment of the line. Many of PLOS s own editors were fuming. One wrote in a comment,  The article should be retracted and the handling editor should be dismissed. As an Editor for this journal, I am appalled. However, the Chinese scientists who wrote the paper said it was all just a big misunderstanding. They claimed that a language barrier is really to blame and they didn t mean to imply that God is to thank for creating our hands. Ming-Jin Liu, the leader author of the study said that the team actually meant  nature.  She explained, Our study has no relationship with creationism. English is not our native language. Our understanding of the word Creator was not actually as a native English speaker expected We will change the Creator to nature in the revised manuscript. I can understand how that could happen, but that doesn t excuse PLOS ONE s editors for publishing something with such a glaring error. That absolutely should have been caught before it went up on the site and it really hurts the journal s credibility. We should be able to go to this site and know that we aren t going to come across any papers that imply creationism is legitimate. It s not, no matter how much the Christian-right fights to make it so.Featured image via Facebook""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But for one conservative commentator, it was the perfect opportunity to attack First Lady Michelle Obama.Conservative blogger and trollumnist Debbie Schlussel struck out on Twitter on Sunday with this pathetic assault on the First Lady.Nancy Reagan brought style & glamour back to the White House & Then Michelle Hussein Obama Took It Away. RIP #tcot #gop #NancyReagan  Debbie Schlussel (@DebbieSchlussel) March 6, 2016Schlussel is a what one might refer to as an ultra-Zionist, a hardliner on Israel who sees no issue with the collective imprisonment and punishment of non-Jews in Israel-Palestine in order to create Jewish Supremacist Apartheid state. To argue on behalf of human rights, democracy and pluralism of race and faith in Israel, is to Schlussel, an anti-Semitic attack.As an example of just how far Schlussel is willing to go to pursue that agenda, check out her response to the murder of American hostage Kayla Mueller by ISIS last year. In a blog post entitled Dead ISIS Hostage Was Jew-Hating, Anti-Israel Bitch,   she wrote that Mueller was:a Jew-hating, anti-Israel piece of crap So, it s poetic justice that Mueller spent her last months as a hostage of the Islamic terrorists with whom she thought she had some sort of kinship and sisterhood. And that she died in their hands.She concludes her piece with the sentence:Buh-bye, Kayla. Have fun with your 72 Yasser Arafats.What evidence was there that Mueller was  jew-hating ? The aid worker s list of previous humanitarian efforts included escorting Palestinian children to school in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, to protect them from violent Jewish-Israeli settlers. The video below is an example of the sort of violence from which the school children need protecting.  Schlussel s attacks on the First Lady and the President are based not on the fact that they are black, but on the presumption that they are Muslim, and that by virtue of being Muslim, they are evil, anti-Semitic and dangerous.Unfortunately for Schlussel, Twitter users were not up for drinking her particular brand of Kool Aid.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""The CNN debate between Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders took place in Flint, Michigan on Sunday   and it featured something truly extraordinary and refreshing.The candidates spent their time presenting two compelling and different visions for America, based on aspirations and hope   and conducted a battle of ideas, not playground level personal insults. It was a perfect insight into what the Republican party is currently incapable of offering the American public.While the Republican debates have featured Donald Trump raving about the size of his own penis, the amount his opponent Marco Rubio sweats, and how Ted Cruz is a liar   Bernie and Hillary kept it classy.In terms of the topics discussed, the Republican debates have so far centered around fighting against immigration, guns, equal marriage, women s reproductive rights, and each other (allowing candidates to respond to whatever personal attacks have been made that week).By contrast, the Democratic debate was wide-ranging, covering a number of social, economic and political issues.Just some of the issues covered:On all of these issues, the candidates had compelling, and different, visions for America.On Flint, both candidates came out strongly on the side of the people. Sanders saying: Over the last several weeks, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents of Flint, had a town meeting in Flint, and I have to tell you, what I heard and what I saw literally shattered me and it was beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan in the United States of America in the years 2016 are being poisoned. That is clearly not what this country should be about. And Clinton adding: The governor should resign or be recalled and we should support the efforts of citizens attempting to achieve that. But that is not enough. We have to focus on what must be done to help the people of Flint. In short, they didn t fight over the matters for which there was no principle at stake. They did not call each other liars or argue their care for the people of Flint was disingenuous just to score a point.But when it came to the issues that divide Sanders from Clinton, they went at it with everything in their arsenal.For example, on money in politics. The Sanders and Clinton campaigns are markedly different. One candidate (Sanders) relying on mass micro-contributions and rejecting the influence of big money backers, and Clinton (as the establishment candidate) doing the opposite. So when the matter arose, Sanders made a simple but powerful point: One of us has a super PAC. One of us has raised $15 million from Wall Street for the super PAC. One of us has given speeches on Wall Street for hundred of thousands of dollars. Conversely, on the issue of gun control   where Clinton is in favor if stricter gun controls while Sanders is more reluctant, it was Clinton who could landed a blow   again, on the issue, not the personal attributes of the candidate.Whichever candidate more closely represents your vision for America, the debate gave you a chance to fully explore their ideas, their policies, and what they would mean for American schools, jobs, daily lives, the economy and the environment. It was a reminder that America can do grown up politics, at a time when the Republican Primary has disintegrated into a frat-house brawl.You can watch the debate in full below:  Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

She knows just how much Wall Street greed had to do with the recession that began with the housing crisis in 2007. She also knows what we need to do to prevent such a crash from ever happening again. One also can t just throw blanket blame at any one company or bank or lender. The crash was a perfect storm of greed and taking advantage of those who simply didn t know better.Here are Hillary Clinton s remarks from December 5, 2007: Now, who s exactly to blame for the housing crisis? Well, that s always a question that the press and people ask and I think there s plenty of blame to go around.Responsibility belongs to mortgage lenders and brokers, who irresponsibly lowered underwriting standards, pushed risky mortgages, and hid the details in the fine print.Responsibility belongs to the Administration and to regulators, who failed to provide adequate oversight, and who failed to respond to the chorus of reports that millions of families were being taken advantage of.Responsibility belongs to the rating agencies, who woefully underestimated the risks involved in mortgage securities.And certainly borrowers share responsibility as well. Homebuyers who paid extra fees to avoid documenting their income should have known they were getting in over their heads. Speculators who were busy buying two, three, four houses to sell for a quick buck don t deserve our sympathy.But finally, responsibility also belongs to Wall Street, which not only enabled but often encouraged reckless mortgage lending. Mortgage lenders didn t have balance sheets big enough to write millions of loans on their own. So Wall Street originated and packaged the loans that common sense warned might very well have ended in collapse and foreclosure. Some people might say Wall Street only helped to distribute risk. I believe Wall Street shifted risk away from people who knew what was going on onto the people who did not.Wall Street may not have created the foreclosure crisis, but Wall Street certainly had a hand in making it worse. If anyone would bother to take the time to read her proposals to make sure a crash never happens again they d soon realize Hillary s not about to let Wall Street get away with anything. Here are her plans:She s also making sure to hold those who break the rules accountable:And if you re still not convinced, feel free to read a more comprehensive version of her plans HERE.We need comprehensive reform. We need solutions that will no only be strong, but long-lasting and unable to be manipulated by those still trying to scam others. Listening to people go after Hillary and say that she d be weak on Wall Street is not only misguided, but simply wrong.

There was a little altercation over the shoes about someone in line. It was a lot of commotion. I don t know who was shooting, but somebody started shooting like six times,  said Latoya Sims, another witness to the shooting.The  little altercation  quickly escalated into a life-or-death scenario. According to police, at least a dozen shell casings were collected from the scene. It was absolutely crazy,  Latrissa Favorite, who was at Foot Locker at the time of the shooting, told WCCO-TV.  I heard police screaming  Get down, get down. Favorite went on to say, It makes you sad for the people and the mentality and mind frame that we have, that we have to kill somebody. That nobody s life is valued anymore. Saturday s shoe-sale shootout is just one of many recent incidents in which a gun was used as a means of settling what should have been a minor dispute.In January, Addicting Info reported on the deaths of a father and son at a gun store in Mississippi. The pair was killed after an argument over a $25 repair bill escalated into a shootout between two fathers and their two sons.In December we reported on a shootout between a Florida pastor and a church maintenance worker, that took place inside the Living Water Fellowship Church in Osceola. The maintenance worker was seriously injured during the gunfire exchange, which began after the pastor threatened to fire him.These kinds of incidents are much more common than you might think.Research conducted last year by Duke University Professor, Jeffrey Swanson, found that the vast majority of the 11,000 or so gun homicides that take place every year in the U.S., happen during an argument.As this detailed report from NCR points out, America s gun problem is twofold.First, there are a growing number of Americans who have serious anger issues. Second, there are a growing number of Americans with access to guns at all times, and in almost all places.When you combine angry people with accessible weapons, people get killed during trivial arguments.According to police, both victims of Saturday s mall shootout were treated for injuries that were not life threatening.They were lucky. Sadly, at least 11,000 U.S. citizens will not be fortunate enough to walk away from a shooting this year.Watch the video below, courtesy of WCCO in Minnesota.Image credit: video screen capture via WCCO in Minnesota""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Takei perfectly captures The Donald s rather impressive ability to ramble endlessly about nothing while avoiding providing an actual answer to even the simplest of queries. I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say,  What s 2+2?  Takei writes.  And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We ve had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can t believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Takei continues, adding: Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I ll tell you.

But while it s great that Romney sees the inherent bigotry in Trump s message and wants to condemn it, there s just one problem: Romney loved Trump back when he was running for president.Or as Trump himself recently crudely put it: He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said,  Mitt, drop to your knees,  and he would have dropped to his knees. He was begging. True. He was begging me. In an interview with CNN s Gloria Borger, Romney was forced to defend his earlier opportunistic praise for Trump   and things quickly went off the rails.When Borger mentioned Trump s endorsement, Romney said at the time Trump didn t seem that bad. Like a good journalist, Borger didn t let him off the hook. Instead, she noted that there were already signs that Donald Trump was a world-class scumbag. After all, he was the  godfather of the Obama birther movement. Romney, in the sort of hypocrisy he became known for during his election campaign, managed to remind us why we didn t vote for him in the first place. Trump s birtherism wasn t a big deal, but attacking Megyn Kelly is.Well, no. I think that s a very different thing than calling Mexicans rapists, than saying that Muslims are not going to be allowed into the country as immigrants, than mocking a disabled reporter, going after women and saying oh, she asks tough questions because she was in her menstrual cycle is highly offensive. I said I disagreed with him. There are political views about one another where we re going to disagree, but what he has said during this campaign, that George W. Bush is a liar, that John McCain isn t a hero. I mean, he said some things that are completely, totally outrageous.So when he makes racist attacks against Obama during Romney s presidential campaign, Romney has no problem, but now that he is undermining the GOP s effort to appeal to minorities or calling George W. Bush a liar, suddenly Romney is feeling very sanctimonious.It was no secret that Mitt Romney spent much of his campaign publicly finger wagging at his voters for obsessing over Obama s birth certificate, while at the same time playing up the controversy at every opportunity. In August of 2012, Romney even took it a step further and stoked the flames himself with this appalling  joke. I love being home, in this place where Ann and I were raised. Where both of us were born No one s ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this is the place that we were born and raised. So when Romney says he disagrees with Trump  now  on the issues, it s only because four years ago, Trump s disgusting racism could be used as a means to an end   whip up the racists and get them to the polls. It s hard to imagine a person having less credibility on the issue of integrity than Mitt Romney.Watch the interview below via CNN (Birther comments begin around the 4:20 mark)Featured image via CNN""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Trump has previously used similar vague threats while speaking of those who are working against his campaign.After finding out that Marlene Ricketts had donated money to a Super PAC that is working against his campaign, Trump went to Twitter where he called the out the Ricketts family (misspelling their name), where he said: They better be careful. They have a lot to hide. Former federal prosecutor Arthur Ferguson has some thoughts on the legality of the matter which you can read here.Trump s campaign has prompted many think pieces on the rise of authoritarianism in the United States. While Trump s campaign may be the one of the loudest examples of right-winger s recent zeal for authoritarian figures and policies, it is by no means the only or even best example.Let s look at what has been going on in Michigan under the administration of Rick Snyder. Snyder and Trump could not be farther apart in terms of how they present themselves to public. Though they are both extreme authoritarian figures. The heart of the Flint water crisis is Michigan s emergency financial manager law. The law allows for the Snyder administration to erode a local government s ability to do anything. Enough voters gleefully cast their ballot in Snyder s name believe in his cause elect him twice. The results of this erosion of democracy are now known internationally.Given the fact that Trump is polling very well in Michigan, Trump will likely win Michigan s primary in a landslide. That also means we can assume that Snyder and Trump have a substantial overlap in their fan base. So what we are seeing right now is the rise of a right-wing that is both willing to respond positively to a presidential candidate who is happy to make vague threats towards them at a campaign rally, while willing to suspend their voice in local political affairs.This should lend more credence to the idea that Trump s supporters are supporting a fascist candidate, more than any endorsement from a has been hate preacher should. There are many interpretations of what a fascist and fascism are.  I prefer the interpretation that a fascist society is one where the means of production have been seized and perverted into a means of destruction. Or in other words, it is when a society s economy commits suicide. In Flint, and elsewhere across the U.S. we have seen that the right-wing is willing to destroy entire populations in the name of trickle-down economics while handing over their political agency to an authoritarian figure.Featured image from video screen capture via Twitter ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It pays slightly more than its competitors (even before the wage increase), closes its doors for major holidays like Thanksgiving and Independence Day and provides health benefits to most of its employees, even those who make an hourly wage.Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress continue to refuse to raise the federal minimum wage to help all American workers across the nation, which has resulted in states and cities raising wages on their own to address the struggle minimum wage workers have faced for decades.Most recently, the state of Oregon passed the highest minimum wage in the nation. In the next few years, Oregonians can expect to make up to $14.50 per hour, which is double the federal minimum wage.Now if only Republicans would stop obeying orders from their corporate masters, perhaps the rest of the American people could get the raise they need to take better care of their families without having to struggle near as much. Alas, it will probably require replacing them with Democrats to make it happen.Featured image from Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Senator Sanders wants America to be a socialist country and even liberals are blasting his agenda,  said host of Fox Business Network s Intelligence Report, Trish Regan, in her introduction of Halvorssen.Halvorssen begins by discussing some of the various definitions of socialism, describing the academic socialism as nearly synonymous with communism, and the differences between countries with socialist governments, like Sweden and Denmark, and socialist authoritarian governments, like Venezuela.Then Thor Halvorssen drops a bomb on Fox News.

Halvorssen then cited the millions of dollars in donations Hillary Clinton received from countries who notoriously violate human rights, such as Saudi Arabia, Oman, Algeria, Bahrain, and Qatar.

I d rather have a democratic socialist than a supporter of dictators in the White House,  Halvorssen concluded.Halvorssen s interview helped dispel some myths surrounding Bernie Sanders candidacy. Sanders  biggest obstacle to the White House, then, is the lack of public understanding of what  democratic socialist  means.

But you have to know this is not healthy. C.K. noted that although he likes the Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, he would enjoy seeing the next president as a conservative. However, he s smart enough to recognize that Trump is not the guy to face Sanders or Clinton, and certainly not presidential material: I m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren t enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time. Trump is not that. He s an insane bigot. He is dangerous. For all the conservatives that have pledged to vote for Trump despite how awful they acknowledge him to be, C.K. had some much-needed advice: If you are a true conservative. Don t vote for Trump. He is not one of you. He is one of him. Everything you have heard him say that you liked, if you look hard enough you will see that he one day said the exact opposite. He is playing you. Trump is not your best. He s the worst of all of us. He s a symptom to a problem that is very real. But don t vote for your own cancer. You re better than that. C.K. is just the latest comedian to blast Trump, and his message follows an epic verbal lashing from John Oliver on Last Week Tonight, which aired a 20-minute takedown of Trump. Many other celebrities, including Miley Cyrus, George Clooney, and Stephen King, have also urged voters to wise up and forget about voting for the business mogul.Currently, the Republican party is scrambling to figure out what to do with Trump. He s currently dominating the GOP polls, and even though several conservatives have pledged to stop him, many Republicans feel helpless and are afraid no other candidate will be able to stop him from getting the nomination.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons and Gage Skidmore""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I ve said repeatedly that I love Trump because he s making it impossible for people to pretend that the conservative movement is not motivated by hate and rage.

This is fueling the anger in this country, and I think this is what we re seeing in this election,  he said.YES! THANK YOU! That s exactly it! Mr. Robb is letting the cat out of the bag that fear and hate is the core of conservatism, a core that Trump is exploiting to great effect. This, as I keep saying, is why the Republican establishment is so mad at Trump. They don t mind the racism, they mind of the overt nature of it. Without the veneer of respectability, Republicans will not be able to pretend they re not the party of old white racists. The corporate media is still working extra hard to avoid using the word  racism  when talking about Trump s  inflammatory  rhetoric but no one s buying even that little bit of pretense.Why else is Trump so popular with white supremacists? He s feeding into all of their fears and that helps their cause.America is no longer the sole property of white people and it s driving whites, particularly conservative whites, into a frenzy of fear and rage. Partly because they expect blacks and Latinos to treat them the same way they treated blacks and Latinos. But, more importantly, with minorities having equal or greater political power, white people are going to be forced to compete on a level economic, legal and social playing field. For people who are utterly convinced that they succeeded 100% due to their own awesomeness, this is a terrifying prospect. America s ENTIRE history has been influenced by the idea that white people are inherently superior. It will be quite the cultural shock to find out that without the system rigged in their favor, whites are just like everyone else.There are a lot of white people who will grasp at any hope of stopping this awful future from coming to pass and Trump is just the man to (make believe he can) do it!

As it turns out, clean energy sources are poised to become less expensive than energy generated by coal and gas, both of which are finite resources.When Governor Kate Brown signs this bill into law Oregonians will get to work enacting it to get the state completely off of the coal grid by 2035. In a statement, Brown praised the legislation, saying it  equips Oregon with a bold and progressive path towards the energy resource mix of the future. Oregon already draws 43 percent of their electricity generation from hydropower, and making the state 100 percent clean energy means Oregon will not be contributing near as big of a carbon footprint as other states in the country. According to Oregon utility company Pacific Power, the new measure would reduce carbon pollution the equivalent of taking over six million cars off the road.This is the second major liberal victory in Oregon this week.Earlier this month, Governor Brown signed a minimum wage bill into law making Oregon the state with the highest minimum wage in the nation.Even the White House praised Oregon s determination to  boost the paychecks of hardworking Americans and help support millions of workers trying to make ends meet,  while also urging Republicans in Congress to do the same for the rest of the American people.So not only is Oregon leading the way on making sure Americans make a fair wage, they are leading the way to make sure people have an environment and a planet to enjoy in the future.Featured Image: Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

How many fields or factories are there? We have to ask ourselves  who benefits from Posted by Bernie Sanders on Saturday, March 5, 2016 In 2008, I traveled to the tomato fields of southern Florida and met with migrant workers who were paid starvation wages for backbreaking work and were being ruthlessly exploited,  wrote Bernie Sanders on his campaign website.  After the visit, I invited leaders of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers to Washington to testify during a Senate committee hearing regarding abusive labor practices. As a result of the tremendous grassroots effort of this coalition, working conditions in Immokalee improved and workers received a wage increase. In 2011, Bernie Sanders wrote an article on what he saw in Immokalee. In the United States of America, millions of workers are being forced into a race to the bottom. As poverty increases and the middle class shrinks, they are seeing their standard of living decline,  he wrote.  They are working longer hours for lower wages, and are losing their health insurance, pensions and other benefits. What we have in the tomato fields of Florida are workers who are living on the lowest rung of the ladder in that race to the bottom. We must address their plight not only from a moral perspective, but with the understanding that if we look the other way, and accept the terrible exploitation they are suffering, every American worker is in danger as that race to the bottom accelerates. If any state in the country needs a Bernie Sanders, it is the state of Florida. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, 3 of the 10 cities in the country with the greatest income inequality are in Florida; Miami, Tampa Bay, and Gainesville. The wealthiest 5 percent of households in Florida earn 24 percent of all income earned in the state. Nearly a quarter of African-Americans in the state can t legally vote because Florida is the only state in the country other than Iowa to place a lifetime ban from voting on convicted felons. South Florida is already facing many threats caused by climate change, with some scientists predicting rising sea levels will flood Miami by 2100. Meanwhile, Florida s Republican Governor Rick Scott has banned state agencies from even using the phrases  global warming  and  climate change  in their correspondence.Whether its environmental concerns or growing levels of poverty and wealth disparity, many of the problems focused on by Bernie Sanders campaign are exemplified in Florida. This is the same state that brought us Jeb Bush, Senator Marco Rubio, and elected Governor Rick Scott, who even Republicans have  called the state s worst governor ever, so it should be no surprise Scott is being seriously considered for Donald Trump s running mate. Hopefully, the campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton can resonate with voters in the state to swing Florida s electoral votes in the direction of Democrats for the 2016 general election because Florida will once again likely be key in determining who the next president of the United States will be.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

You can t be a black man and enjoy your morning, because the police are going to harass you in Cincinnati, Ohio,  Harrell explained.  Walking down the street, the cop just asked me if I have a problem. Off-camera the officer, identified as Baron Osterman, can be heard telling Harrell that he crossed against the light on the deserted street. Sir, you were scaring me, sir. I don t know why were following me, anyway,  Harrell replied.  You were following me all the way down the street. If you watch the video, the cop was following Harrell obviously looking for a reason to stop him. As soon as he crossed against the light, the officer leapt into action to deal with the dastardly crime of drinking coffee while black jaywalking. Harrell is arrested because he had the gall to stand up for his civil right not to be harassed for no reason whatsoever.Here s the video: I m 42 years old and I have literally never been stopped by a cop while walking in my life except that one time I jumped a turnstile in high school. This is why it s awesome to be white in America. The cops don t see you as you go about your life and you don t see them. But if you re black, especially a black male? You have a giant neon sign over your head that says  CAUTION! POTENTIAL CRIMINAL! Most white people don t understand this reality at all. Even white people like me that do understand it only do so on an intellectual level. The closest I can get to understanding it on an emotional level is this:You know that feeling of dread you get when you re driving and a cop car gets in your lane behind you? Your heart rate goes up and you get nervous. Did you forget to signal a turn? Is one of your lights out? Are you speeding? What does he want? What? WHAT?!Now imagine the cop car is always behind you everywhere you drive and if you sneeze the wrong way, those flashing lights are going to turn on instantly. That s what I imagine it must be like to be like to be black in a heavily policed community. Oh, and as a bonus, instead of getting a ticket, there s a good chance you ll get the shit beaten out of you, arrested or shot. Or possibly all three.

In the days after long-time Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, McCain became one of the de facto cheerleaders for the Senate Republican plan to spend the next year preventing Obama from fulfilling his constitutional obligation to nominate a replacement.He announced that he would be standing with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in opposing any nomination until after the election   which means the seat would remain unfilled for nearly a year, and perhaps a great deal longer. For Republicans, this knee-jerk obstruction was so automatic that it seems almost nobody thought it through beforehand. So quick were they to oppose Obama, that they didn t stop to think about how it would look for the party already known for saying  no  to issue blanket opposition to a constitutional mandate.McCain, like many of his colleagues, is now discovering that his headlong rush into obstruction may be a career-ending blunder. A new poll conducted by Public Policy Polling found that his constituents in Arizona are fed up with his antics, and his already-low favorability numbers are tanking hard.As to McCain s position, 55 percent said it made them less likely to vote for his re-election this year; 21 percent said it made them more likely to vote for him; and 24 percent said it wouldn t make any difference.The poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points, also indicated that just 26 percent approve of McCain s job performance while 63 percent disapprove and 12 percent were unsure.In short: Nobody in Arizona seems to have any respect for John McCain. That s not a good position to be in, because McCain is facing a tough primary and an even tougher Democratic challenger in November. Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick is running for McCain s seat, and wasted no time calling out the senator: Members of the U.S. Senate have an obligation to uphold the Constitution and fulfill their duties, including voting on Supreme Court nominees regardless of party affiliation,  Kirkpatrick told the press via a prepared statement.  John McCain used to take that responsibility seriously. Care to hazard a guess what McCain s reaction to the poll was? Here s his campaign spokeswoman: This fake  poll from liberal activists is the creation of partisan Democrat hacks who have tried and failed for years to defeat John McCain. Liberal bias, right on cue.At this point in his life, McCain isn t just fighting for his continued career in politics, he s fighting for his legacy. Rather than go out with a modicum of integrity, he decided to listen to the lemmings in his party that promised him that salvation was just beyond that edge of that cliff they were headed towards. It s painful to watch. Sadly, for politicians, you are only as good as the last thing you did. McCain will go out being remembered as a deeply unpopular senator who was so blinded by his hatred of Obama that it prevented him from accomplishing anything.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Her latest Patheos blog post talks about just how lucky her son is to have grown up around guns because of an asinine gun control experiment out of Texas specifically aimed at gun sales to families. It s actually quite sickening.In the video, children are left into a room full of toys, among which is hidden an unloaded handgun. Within 15 seconds a child finds the gun and begins treating it like any of the other toys in the room. Parents stand horrified as their children, cast into an unsupervised play environment, take the gun and point it at each other. In the end, a police officer helping conduct this bogus  experiment  points out that the children playing with the gun come from a home with no guns, where the two children who wouldn t touch the gun come from homes where guns are available and talked about.That s what Bristol Palin decides to jump on. Finally, someone is calling her a good parent, which is, of course, ludicrous, but she seems to be comfortable with it. She wrote: Only the children whose homes had exposed them to guns knew not to touch the dangerous toy. As other children ran around pointing it at each other, two stood back because their parents understood the importance of teaching and appropriate exposure.Parents assume their child will automatically know what is and is not dangerous. The danger is not guns themselves, but a lack of education.So thankful Tripp is around guns and knows how to act around them. The danger is not the gun itself but a lack of education? What a crock of doody. This is America, Bristol. The bulk of guns owned by civilians are because of a lack of education. People believe guns make them safer, that they can thwart crimes and that they are somehow more patriotic for having one. The reality is far simpler: If there were fewer guns, fewer people would get shot.The entire scenario is designed to portray people who don t own guns as bad parents, because their children have no experience with guns. The two kinds of parents portrayed get the exact result you may expect, but Palin, as dense as she is, takes the lesson to the stupid place, arguing that only children who have been exposed to guns have a chance of growing up safe in America.The two types of parents not included that would round out this experiment would be the idiots who think kids don t need to learn about gun safety as long as you leave the safety on and parents who refuse to have guns in their home and add the benefit of educating their children why they are so dangerous. Those parents aren t needed to prove to someone as ill-prepared for parenthood as Bristol Palin that there may be more to this experiment. The notion that raising your children around guns makes them safer would be much more believable if we didn t have to read about yet another toddler killing his sister or a little guy pulling a gun from the glove compartment and shooting Grandpa. If there were no two-year-olds pulling pistols from their mothers  purse and shooting them in Walmart it may be easier to swallow.What may be a better gauge of how safe non-gun homes are as opposed to homes with guns would be to count the accidental firearm deaths from each. I can guarantee you that my children will never grab a loaded weapon from anywhere in my house and pull the trigger. I can also guarantee that they have seen and been taught exactly how dangerous guns are and wouldn t touch one for any reason in somebody else s home, either.It s all well and good to use these parents who probably haven t considered that their kids may run into guns at their friends  houses as bad examples, but in the end, they go home to a house with no guns; to playrooms where no guns will be hidden. Those  responsible  children? They may not have touched the gun but they are the only ones with true access.

Without drastic intervention, however, the citizens of LA are about to lose access to the fundamental right to legal representation.That s because Jindal s budget cuts decimated the state s system of public defense.According to ACLU attorney Brandon Buskey, the state s public defense system is so short of funding that 33 of the state s 42 districts will be shuttered over the next year, leaving the poor without access to legal representation.In a statement to The Guardian on March 4, 2016, Buskey said, The system is on course to collapse by next summer   we will have no public defense system in any sense of the word. We are talking about the wholesale destruction of a public function. According to Buskey, LA citizens are already experiencing the brutal impact of Jindal s failure to fund the public defense system. In metropolitan areas, such as New Orleans, public defenders are unable to take on new cases, leaving citizens who cannot afford a private attorney with no access to legal representation.The result is that potentially innocent people are trapped behind bars, with no way out.Buckley explained, In Orleans, we already have dozens of people held in jail for weeks on end without conviction and with no way of getting themselves out. We are literally trapping people in jail with no way out. LA public defender, James Dixon, told The Guardian that the state s failure to provide for public defense will cause extreme harm to juveniles, saying, We will no longer be able adequately to represent the kids in this state. If a child is charged with burglary or theft, they are going to go unrepresented, and that scares me. As The Guardian reports here, The funding meltdown also threatens to aggravate the existing inequalities in Louisiana s criminal justice system, by creating a two-tier service in which wealthier citizens can employ private lawyers while poor Louisianans are left to their own devices. Dixon pointed out,  This is an absolute injustice   that the poor will sit in jail without any representation just because they have no money. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that, In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence. What is happening in LA today is not only immoral and inhumane, it s also a violation of the United States Constitution, a document which republicans claim to be deeply devoted to.As a result of Jindal s irresponsible handling of the state s budget, innocent citizens could be forced to spend months behind bars after being accused of a crime they did not commit.At the same time, dangerous criminals, guilty of violent offenses, are likely to see their cases thrown out, due to the state s failure to uphold the Constitutional rights of the accused.Thanks to Jindal, who used the state s budget to conduct an experiment in GOP trickle-down economic theory, the state of Louisiana now faces a $1.6 billion budget shortfall.A new budget, proposed by the state s recently-elected democratic Governor, Jon Bel Edwards, and approved by the state legislature, attempts to correct the budget shortfall, but in doing so, leaves the public defense system virtually unfunded. The new budget would slash funding for public defense by 62 percent, reducing the amount of money allocated from $33m to under $13m.The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of the state s accused. The suit attacks what the ACLU calls the state s  chronic underfunding of its public defender system. Image from Wikimedia Commons""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

From CBS Dallas:During his radio show Friday morning, Beck and his producers were talking about the other candidates saying they would support Donald Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee.His producer mocked Beck after Beck mentioned being in the shoes of Trump s rivals: Was it gigantic shoes?  asked the producer Stu Burguiere.

Beck was apparently talking about his producer, Stu Burguiere. Burguiere posted on his Facebook page after the incident noting,  If you were listening, you know that Glenn actually threatened me, not Donald Trump, so I am in the odd situation of defending my boss for threatening my life. The comments may have been seen as more credible because Beck has been a critic of Trump, claiming that his preferred candidate, Ted Cruz, is more qualified and destined for the presidency than Trump. Beck has accused Trump of being a huckster and a phony.It seems fitting that a conservative media outlet s sloppy reporting led to federal law enforcement being called in on another conservative media icon.Beck has for years promoted conspiracy theories about President Obama, Democrats, and other progressives.

Beck s theories were so out there that advertisers began abandoning his afternoon show on Fox News, and the network soon dropped him.

Hodges ruling last summer, Alabama has resisted following it.Almost immediately, Moore ordered county clerks and judges to refuse to help same-sex couples get married, claiming that the nation s high court has no power to overturn a state ban on same-sex marriage.Despite Moore s efforts to keep defying the Supreme Court, his colleagues on the state bench made the opposite decision on Friday.In a single sentence, the Alabama Supreme Court chose to not defy the high court by rejecting an anti-same-sex marriage case brought by the Alabama Citizens Action Program and the Alabama Policy Institute. It is ordered that all pending motions and petitions are dismissed,  the majority of the court ruled, thus ending the fight against federal authorities that Moore wanted so badly.According to the Associated Press,In one of several written opinions accompanying the order, Justice Greg Shaw called the decision a  clear refusal  to ignore the Supreme Court ruling last June.Several other state justices railed against the high court s ruling while noting they can t overturn it.Chief Justice Roy Moore wrote that previous state orders barring gay marriage in Alabama remain. Most probate judges already are ignoring that directive, however, and hundreds of same-sex couples already have wed in Alabama.NBC News had more about what Moore wrote in his dissenting opinion.Quoting everything from past court rulings to the Bible and the 1974 song  Feelings,  the chief justice called the court s ruling  immoral, unconstitutional and tyrannical.  He referred to homosexuality as a  disgrace to human nature  which can t be compared to opposite-sex intimacy. Sodomy has never been and never will be an act by which a marriage can be consummated,  Moore wrote.This is a victory for the LGBT community and a victory for sanity in general. Even Moore s fellow judges acknowledged that the U.S. Supreme Court has the final say and federal law trumps state law no matter how they may feel about same-sex marriage personally.It s definitely a significant setback for conservative  Christians  in the state who were hoping to keep bigotry, hate, and their ability to discriminate at will enshrined under state law.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Maher says: It explains why John McCain supports every form of war ever invented and some he just fantasizes about in the shower but torture? No, because he was tortured by Sarah Palin. It explains why Ronald Reagan suddenly cared about AIDS only after it struck his friend Rock Hudson. And why Nancy Reagan got religion on stem cell research after Ronnie got Alzheimer s. And it explains why Newt Gingrich gave up hunting after he married an owl. That s good news for people on the right side of history already. Most Republican politicians eventually catch up with the rest of class on most issues. It may take a long time and a lot of work but public opinion shifts and they must shift along with it.The problem is if having a personal stake in the matter is the spark that helps create that shift, issues that are more recondite in nature can be almost impossible for them to change their minds on. Issues like climate change just won t become a major issue for most Republicans.Maher makes fun of this, hoping that the gods of irony hit Republicans with problems caused by environmental destruction. Let Rush Limbaugh be attacked by a swarm of dying bees and the Koch brothers be swallowed up by a fracking-induced earthquake. And to slap the global warming denial out of Marco Rubio whose own state of Florida is one of the most likely places to be inundated by rising oceans his own home must get flooded and Marco must be swept out to sea and washed up all the way back to Cuba, where we will find out that Marco Rubio is really Elian Gonzalez.

Well, some people are scratching their heads and asking where all those donations really went.Just days after his fundraiser, Trump was bragging about how much money he was able to raise. At a campaign rally in Iowa, Trump boasted,  One hour. Six million dollars.  According to the business mogul, there were over 20 groups that the money would benefit. Trump said, These people that get these checks are amazing people, amazing people. But it s been several weeks since the fundraiser, and a summary released on Thursday by Trump s campaign reports that only about $3 million has been donated to the charities Trump listed. Where s the other half?After Trump s campaign would not give details about where the donations had gone, the Washington Post contacted every single one of those 24 veterans charities, asking them how much they d received from Trump. The Post said the numbers only added up to less than half of the $6 million. And The Post was being generous   According to CNN s investigation, the network could only account for $800,000   and not all of it was directly from Trump! Here s the report from CNN:After these investigations, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks criticized the media for its curiosity and said that the rest of the money would eventually be released to the veterans groups, but she didn t specify when: If the media spent half as much time highlighting the work of these groups and how our veterans have been so mistreated, rather than trying to disparage Mr. Trump s generosity for a totally unsolicited gesture for which he had no obligation, we would all be better for it. For the veterans groups that were promised donations, the situation has been more than frustrating. For many of these organizations, a donation like the ones they were promised could be life-altering. Keith David from the Task Force Dagger Foundation  one of the veterans groups that Trump said he would be disbursing the money to, asked, Where s the rest of the money going? David s group received a check for only $50,000   a small amount considering how much money Trump had actually promised the groups. David said with reasonable concern, There s a large chunk missing. I m just kind of curious as to where that money went. I d like to see some of it come to us, because we are on the list. Because of the missing donations, questions are being raised about how much longer Trump will keep the donated money in his personal charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which gives donations to  boost his political brand.  Meanwhile, Trump continues to brag about the fact that he is  self-funding my own campaign  I don t think I get enough credit for self-funding.  But what Trump doesn t tell us is that his self-funding isn t really self-funded at all.Most of Trump s funding is actually from  candidate loans , which Trump must pay off with donations from individual contributors   and he s struggling. In January, the same month Trump s veteran fundraiser was held, Trump got $12.6 million in candidate loans, but only $4.9 million was raised from his donors.If Trump is concerned about his opponents calling him a con artist, he s certainly doing a great job validating their insults.

The Republican Party is having an existential crisis. They are very upset that half their voters want to give nuclear weapons to a guy who gets into Twitter feuds with D-list celebrities. We understand that. I almost feel bad for them, except I really don t, because they brought this on themselves. They made a Faustian deal with the racist devil years ago and now those chickens are coming home to roost. He then read a statement made by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said that any person who wants to be the GOP nominee must reject bigotry because  this party does not prey on people s prejudices. Maher immediately called bullshit, pointing out that if Republicans really believed that they wouldn t be pursuing voter ID laws that disenfranchise minority voters or jump to the defense of a police officer every time an unarmed black man is shot dead. Who are they kidding?  Maher asked.  This is the party they are and Trump is just the latest. Indeed, Donald Trump rallies have become nothing more than giant white supremacist rallies where Trump disparages people of color and orders his goons to beat up black protesters and remove them from the audience.Conservative author Matt Lewis admitted that the GOP has been dumbing down its voters but claimed that racism isn t as prevalent within the party as it seems. After claiming that the GOP presidential field is more diverse than the Democratic field, Maher noted that the two Hispanic candidates, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio,  want to put other Hispanics on cattle carts and throw them out of the country. Maryland Rep. Donna Edwards also chimed in by pointing out that Republicans are starting to line up behind Trump despite objections to his racism, so they can t really have much of a problem with it.Maher also reminded Lewis that what Republicans are doing now isn t new. It was called the Southern Strategy when Nixon did it. Reagan started his campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi. It s always been a winking campaign to get white poor people, mostly, who have a resentment to vote racially. Let s not pretend this is new. In the end, Maher said the GOP  big tent  is more like a house. The Republican establishment gave racists a room in their house and now the racists have taken over the house to the point where moderate Republicans are scared to go to the kitchen at night for a snack.Here s the video via YouTube.

In addition to those from the MSNBC personalities, there were messages from longtime Barack Obama advisor David Axelrod, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, and boxing promoter Don King, all of whom spoke to Trump in a friendly and familiar manner.

Apparently wanting Trump s discount for the Gucci store that his located inside Trump s 5th Avenue building. She also apparently said: I hope you re bracing for Romney to get his butt whipped tomorrow by Obama. Showing that the message clearly dates back to the 2012 election.

Already Republican super PACs are attacking Trump on the issue. But here are 4 secrets about Trump University that Democrats are sure to use against him in the fall election, which could quickly deny him the White House.Trump University was actually a series of seminars often organized and held in the lobbies of hotels across the country, preying on people who hoped to duplicate the success Donald Trump claims he has had in the real estate industry. The  school  promised regular Joes and Jills they would have access to Trump s unique insights and techniques.In an email to prospective clients, Trump bragged,  Seventy-six percent of the world s millionaires made their fortunes in real estate  and told people,  My father did it, I did it, and now I m ready to teach you how to do it. Of course, Trump s father  did it  by reportedly engaging in racist practices while a landlord, and Trump himself started out with a million-dollar loan from his dad and a series of shaky deals built on other people s money, sometimes resulting in bankruptcies.Less than a year after the business launched in 2004, the New York State Department of Education said it was operating an unlicensed educational institution, a violation a state law. So by 2010, the name was changed to  Trump Entrepreneur Initiative. Trump University is being sued in New York by attorney general Eric T. Schneiderman and in two class action lawsuits in California.In the New York lawsuit, the school has been accused of being a  bait and switch  operation that relied on totally false advertising.One ad published at least 170 times across the country in 2009, according to Mr. Schneiderman s office, promised that students would  learn from Donald Trump s handpicked instructors, and that participants would have access to Trump s real estate  secrets.   But an investigation by Mr. Schneiderman s office found that Mr. Trump had little to do with picking instructors or developing the curriculums for the seminars, which were run largely by people with motivational speaking backgrounds who were compensated based on how many people they persuaded to buy additional seminars. One of them was a manager at a Buffalo Wild Wings.Here s one of the adsKathleen Meese of Schoharie, N.Y. was caring for her son with Down syndrome attended a Trump University three-day conference at a hotel in Malta, N.Y. and was then hit with a hard sell in which she was told she could make money faster if she signed up for the  Gold Elite  program which cost $25,000. She said a Trump University trainer pressured her into putting the costs on her credit card that only had a $30,000 limit who told her  I had to find the resources to invest in my future. In an affidavit in the New York lawsuit against Trump, Meese testified that all that money bought her was a few visits to some rental properties, noting,  I was unable to get my refund and am still paying off debts from my Trump tuition. Trump University students say they were led to believe that at the seminar they would get the opportunity to take a photo with Trump himself, which of course is something a wannabe real estate mogul would love to get a shot at.Instead of a photo with the real-live Trump, they were instead directed to stand next to a cardboard cutout of Trump for a picture.Here is an example of one such photo:I don't know why people say Trump University was a scam: a photo with my cardboard cutout is totally worth $36,000! pic.twitter.com/LW7q8FZ6Uo  Donald J.

Speaking further on why President Obama chose to go after Trump s slogan as he did, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reiterated the president s sentiments, saying: The longer-term trends were further cemented in this month s job numbers There s a vigorous political debate going on in the country. The debate in the general election will be focused on whether or not we build on the progress that we ve made over the last seven years   or are we going to turn back to the policies that actually led to the  Great Recession ? And that s just it. Republicans keep going after Obama, but truth be told, things have gotten remarkably better and just keep continuing along that trend.

It is, after a fashion, child labor. The great scandal is not that the Girl Scouts are promoting child labor, it s that there isn t more child labor in the United States today.Source: The FederalistThe author then complains about the fact the government has outlawed  every meaningful kind  of occupation for children younger than 14, Citing  any manufacturing occupation,   most processing occupations,   all work requiring the use of ladders, scaffolds or their substitutes,   outside window washing. Children younger than 14 should not have any meaningful kind of occupation other than school student! The sheer insanity of this is beyond words.He goes on to say that there is even a  strong case  for abolishing what he calls  compulsory education,  by letting them not go to school in exchange for being able to work full-time instead. I m sure a 10-year-old will land a good-paying full-time job where they can support themselves over the next 70 years with no schooling.The American right-wing has totally gone off the deep end. You might say  But this is only one writer s opinion.  The problem is, it isn t. Elected federal-level Republicans have resurrected the idea of removing safeguards against child labor just a few years ago. Even wannabe presidential candidates have advocated for it. It s a real thing that Republicans want to do, and that scares the hell out of me.If those freeloading Girl Scouts can safely sell harmless boxes of cookies for one month a year, why aren t they working the other 11 months in a steel mill instead of wasting time being  forced  to go to school.

Normally, if an African-American speaks out against Trump at one of his events, he or she is met with violence.After an African-American man at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama, stood up for himself and declared that black lives matter just as much as white lives, Trump supporters descended on him, punching, kicking, and dragging the man simply because expressed an opinion as well as calling him a  n*gger  and other slurs. Trump could have denounced this violence and hate. Instead, he explained that  maybe he should have been roughed up. One Trump supporter, Robert Kiger, told CNN at the time that the man deserved it because Birmingham, Alabama, a historical hotbed of KKK activity in which many civil rights battles took place, is  no place for Black Lives Matter to try to bring their issues to the forefront. More recently, a Trump fan was discharged from the United States Marine Corp. for his role in an attack on a black woman at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky.

Now, a California lawsuit has many comparing a San Fransisco woman to Rosa Parks   with very good reason.Toni Young was traveling via Greyhound to a family celebration in Sacramento.

The driver explained to Young that she was expecting an elderly woman to board once they reached Sacramento   Young s destination   and that she would need to move to the back of the bus.Young explained that she would be getting off the bus in Sacramento, and that the seat would be available when it was needed. This was not good enough for Lara, however, and she insisted that Young move, complaining that the woman was far too uppity. Young  quietly  complied, but her attorney, Michael Adams, explains: My client quietly said to her,  You don t have to have an attitude about this . Lara then   loudly asserted that she did not have any attitude  and called for security to remove Young from the bus in Oakland. At that point, Young says Lara  loudly muttered  a racial slur. It was shocking to me that we have an incident like this reminiscent of the Rosa Parks incident many years ago,  Adams says. Young then had to wait several hours for another bus. While she awaited her new transportation, she asked for paperwork to file a complaint, but was told Greyhound was out of the forms. She requested to speak to a manager, but was informed none were available.Young eventually reached Sacramento, but the family celebration had ended by the time she arrived. It was the most dehumanizing incident of my life,  explained Young.  I will never ride a Greyhound bus again. Young says she suffers from psychological trauma, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. She is seeking punitive damages from the company. It was shocking to me that we have an incident like this reminiscent of the Rosa Parks incident many years ago,  Adams says, pointing to an incident last year when a group of African-American women were kicked off a Napa Valley Wine Train for  laughing while black.

Eli Apple, star cornerback coming out of Ohio State, met with an Atlanta Falcons coach last week. According to Apple, the coach who has not yet been identified, asked him point-blank,  So do you like men? Apple told Comcast SportsNet: I ve been asked a lot of weird questions. I don t know if I could say on TV. The Falcons coach, one of the coaches, was like,  So do you like men?  It was like the first thing he asked me. It was weird. I was just like,  no.  He was like,  if you re going to come to Atlanta, sometimes that s how it is around here, you re going to have to get used to it.  I guess he was joking but they just ask most of these questions to see how you re going to react. How did this coach think that question would, in any way, be appropriate. If Apple were gay, which he is not, what difference would it make? And for that to be one of the first things asked is just beyond odd.Fortunately, Falcons Head Coach Dan Quinn was equally as appalled as pretty much everyone else finding out about this line of question and released the following statement regarding what happened with Apple: I am really disappointed in the question that was asked by one of our coaches. I have spoken to the coach that interviewed Eli Apple and explained to him how inappropriate and unprofessional this was. I have reiterated this to the entire coaching staff and I want to apologize to Eli for this even coming up. This is not what the Atlanta Falcons are about and it is not how we are going to conduct ourselves. Hopefully, the coach who asked this inappropriate line of questions receives more of a consequence than just a stern talking to, but at least Quinn is willing to acknowledge the fault in this line of questioning to any player, regardless of sexual orientation.

Marie Hatch is my sister s former mother-in-law, and she is 97 years old. She has lived in the same house in Burlingame for 66 years.  As she has no email or tech savvy at 97 years of age, and as her life-long friend, I am starting this fund for her. On Feb. 11, she was served with a 60-day notice to vacate the house or be tossed out by sheriff s deputies. Marie is fighting her second battle with cancer and has no more in her savings account.  The man who is evicting her inherited the house by default from his estranged wife who was murdered.  His wife, her mother AND her grandmother all promised Marie that she could live out her natural life in the house. According to the post, Ms. Hatch worked hard throughout her life, in order to be able to remain in her home. She and her roommate, 85-year-old Georgia Rothrock, paid $900 a month to live in the 2 bedroom house.In February, ABC News interviewed the elderly woman at her California home.During the interview, Ms. Hatch was asked where she would go if she had to leave her home.  I don t know,  she answered, saying,  I don t have the slightest idea where I m gonna go.  She paused for a moment, before telling the interviewer,  That s why I don t sleep good at nights. Watch the brief interview below.The Internet came together to try to help Ms. Hatch stay in her home. The gofundme.com page raised $47,212.People from all across the country made phone calls and wrote letters on behalf of the elderly woman.On March 3, Lisa Krieger informed supporters on gofundme.com of Ms. Hatch s death, writing, I m sorry to have to post this, but Marie passed away earlier this evening. She was unable to fight off the respiratory virus that landed her in the hospital a couple of days ago. She was at home with her son when she died. She has been through a lot since February 11, and her body and spirit were too weak to sustain her. Thank you for all your support. Currently, I m at a loss for words. Thank you. During an interview with Mercury News, the pro bono attorneys representing her said  There is no doubt that the callous eviction of Marie Hatch has caused her death. According to ABC News, the two bedroom home which Ms. Hatch moved into in the 1950s, was valued at more than $1.5 million on today s market.It s a sad commentary on  American values,  that Ms. Hatch spent her last days on earth worrying about being ripped from her home of more than six decades, all because of another person s greed.Sadly, Marie Hatch is not alone.The rising cost of housing has forced many seniors from their homes in recent years.Seniors like Hatch are often forced to rely on a fixed income. As living costs continue to rise across the country, seniors find that their income is stretched beyond its limits. Many are forced to leave lifelong homes, taking up residence in low-income or government subsidized housing in response to rising costs.What s more, between 2007 and 2011, more than 1.5 million older Americans lost their homes to foreclosure. As the New York Times reports here, the highest percentage of those were seniors over the age of 75.Remember the American dream? That was when hard-working Americans were able to buy a home and pay off a mortgage before retirement age.For a growing majority of Americans, that dream will never be a reality. Instead, seniors are more likely to be forced from their homes at or near the end of their lives.That s something we need to change.RIP Marie.Featured image credit: video screen capture from ABC News""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

What the f*ck?  Noah responded.  I ve seen this argument on Facebook   in fact, I ve seen it everywhere online.  Did you know that Democrats are the real racist party? And did you know the Republican Party freed the slaves? Noah called Lord s claim  bullshit,  and proceeded to delve into history to demonstrate how the KKK switched their allegiance to the Republican Party. A lot of people like to skip over the fact that, when it comes to race relations, historically, Republicans and Democrats switched positions,  Noah said.  Yeah. Republicans were basically Democrats, and Democrats were basically Republicans. Noah explained that while it s true that the KKK supported Democrats for decades after Lincoln freed and slaves, the white supremacist group switched to a more welcoming Republican Party in the 1960s after Democrats began supporting and enacting policies like the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Presidents Harry S Truman and Lyndon Johnson, both southerners, angered what became known as the Dixiecrats, Southern Democrats who left the Democratic Party starting in 1948 in opposition to the expansion of civil rights.Johnson would predict while signing the Civil Rights Act of 1965 that Democrats just  lost the South for a generation. He was half-right,  Noah said,  because, in fact, the Democrats lost the South for more than a generation. Indeed, the once proud party of Lincoln quickly became a big tent for racists to flock to for shelter and it has not only remained that way ever since, the racists have now seized control of the party entirely.Noah even used  huge racist  former Senator Strom Thurmond as an example of how Southern Democrats turned Republican. Strom Thurmond was among the most racist politicians of his generation, and in the  60s, he switched to being a Republican because he felt more welcome,  Noah said of Thurmond, who started his political career as a Democrat in the 1930s. Just because something used to be something, doesn t mean it still is,  Noah said.  What matters more is what it is now. Like a butterfly used to be a caterpillar   you don t call it a flying caterpillar. Here s the video via Comedy Central:The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Get More: The Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,The Daily Show Video ArchiveIn short, what matters is that the Republican Party is associated with the KKK and the KKK supports the Republican Party. That s been the case for a few decades now, but it s incredibly obvious today in 2016.

Mocking this strategy, Colbert says: What an inspiring message for the world s greatest democracy. Don t vote for who you think should be president, vote for whichever candidate in your state has the best chance of keeping Trump from getting enough delegates. It s a system often employed by bros in bars that rhymes with clock block. The GOP has cast Mitt Romney as their knight in Republican red.

After you vote, maybe they ll give you a sticker that says,  I did what Mitt Romney told me to do.

I want that to sink into your ears and mind. My President, you saved my life, and I am eternally grateful.I have a  pre-existing condition  and so could never purchase health insurance. Only after the ACA came into being could I be covered. Put simply to not take up too much of your time if you are in fact taking the time to read this: I would not be alive without access to care I received due to your law. So thank you from a dumb young man who thought he knew it all and who said things about you that he now regrets. Thank you for serving me even when I didn t vote for you.Thank you for being my President.Honored to have lived under your leadership and guidance,Brent Nathan BrownIn a follow-up letter, Brown updated President Obama on how he is doing thanks to the Affordable Care Act.The Affordable Care Act saved my life. I can now say, after several surgeries, that I m in recovery from what was a serious autoimmune disease I was finally able to receive the quality of care that had eluded me for years. I was able to consult the top surgeon in my state for the particular surgery I needed. I was able to receive the stabilizing drug that was always hidden behind a doctor s apology:  I m sorry, Mr. Brown, we have to take your financial consideration into account.  I was able to stay at one of the best equipped hospitals in my state for as long as I needed, without having to worry about checking myself out early because of cost concerns. I had hope.If Republican lawmakers have their way, people like Brent Brown would lose this hope. They would be stripped of the newly found healthcare that they have waited years to finally receive. This letter is not only a testament to how Obamacare is helping millions of Americans, it s a warning to Republicans that they would be hurting their own voters by repealing the ACA.Brent Brown is a shining example of the Affordable Care Act s success and necessity, and he had the courage to say he was wrong and thank President Obama for fighting for him. It s too bad other Republicans refuse to do the same.Featured Image: Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This is not satire. This actually happened.The weirdest campaign moment yet came after a plea by Marco Rubio that the GOP candidates end their war of insults, and keep the debate to a battle of ideas instead. At which point, Trump took us on a tangent, which ended with him telling us all about the size of his penis.Basically, Trump has been smarting for a quarter of a century over a slight made against him by journalist Graydon Carter. The Vanity Fair writer wrote a negative piece on Trump, in which he called him a  short-fingered vulgarian. Last October, Carter published a piece in Vanity Fair entitled: Why Donald Trump Will Always Be a  Short-Fingered Vulgarian - in which he detailed Trump s thin-skinned response to the criticism, and his refusal to let the matter go. He writes:Like so many bullies, Trump has skin of gossamer. He thinks nothing of saying the most hurtful thing about someone else, but when he hears a whisper that runs counter to his own vainglorious self-image, he coils like a caged ferret. Just to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a  short-fingered vulgarian  in the pages of Spy magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago. To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers.And so it was, that Trump decided that a Primary debate to decide the Republican nominee for President of the United States, was the appropriate place to brag about the size of his penis. Look at those hands. Are they small hands?  he told the crowd, holding his (admittedly stubby) fingers out towards the audience and the cameras. He referred to my hands,  if they re small, something else must be small.  I guarantee you there s no problem. I guarantee. There was awkward laughter from the audience. There was probably much louder laughter around the world, as U.S. politics is turned into the kind of embarrassing spectacle that we are more used to seeing from North Korea or other banana republics. Donald Trump is fast becoming the Kim Jong Un of America: an over-fed, over-indulged, hyper-vain authoritarian who embarrasses his nation every time he embarrasses himself.

The scene in question has reportedly been getting rave reviews. Audiences at test screenings both international and in the United States were left cracking up.In a [one] scene, history repeats itself with  Daniel  getting shot and his infected blood landing in the mouth of Donald Trump.Unsurprisingly, there was a massive cheer when that happened.Overseas, where people find it hard to believe that America s political process is being hijacked by a guy like Trump, found an even more receptive audience.In Europe, there were standing ovations. The joke, done in Baron Cohen s standard over-the-top style, is proving cathartic to overseas audiences terrified by Trump s rise.Cheering someone getting HIV is a bit cruel   but Trump can t really complain. After all, during the Ebola crisis, he very publicly suggested American doctors be abandoned to die of the illness in Africa.The U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back. People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 2, 2014But while audiences are cheering, Sony Pictures isn t laughing. Having slowly realized that, yes, Donald Trump is probably going to be the Republican presidential candidate despite having no actual political expertise and his unapologetic bigotry, the studio is freaking out. Their concerns are two-fold: First, they don t want to alienate the millions of Republican voters who suddenly adore Donald Trump. Second, they are worried that Trump himself will learn about the scene and literally sue them.Studio executives are nervous about angering the famously vengeful and litigious Trump, compounded by the possibility of getting on the wrong side of the possible next president. If you were told that they re shying away from the movie because of the political implications, I can tell you that s 100 percent true,  said a well-placed source.It s certainly not beyond the realm of possibility. Trump has, at various times, threatened to sue nearly every person, corporation, or newspaper on Earth. When the Washington Post tried to track down the number of lawsuits Trump has threatened over the years, they gave up, saying the number was too high to count.Hilariously, Sony s solution was to add a disclaimer to the beginning of the film that specifically tells audiences that Trump had nothing to do with the film   as if they needed to be told. This will, of course, have the unintended effect of bring more attention to Trump. Not so funny is the disturbing implications of a major motion pictures studio censoring one of its own movies (at a high cost) just to avoid angering the man who wants to be president. Already Trump has hinted that, if elected, he will begin dismantling parts of the First Amendment that deal with free press. Instead, he vowed to  open libel laws  so he can sue newspapers that attack him.It appears that just the threat of a lawsuit has already had a chilling effect on free speech. Sacha Baron Cohen brutally mocked America s jingoism and in-grained prejudices with  Borat  during the Bush years.

There has been some speculation that Trump himself may be facing charges as a ringleader, but that is unconfirmed at this time. What we do know is that a woman was treated with the utmost of disrespect, was physically and verbally assaulted and quite possibly had her civil rights violated for no reason other than the color of her skin.It s a common scene at these things.

Here s what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,  Romney declared in an attempt to convince voters in other states to deny the Republican front-runner the nomination.  He s playing the members of the American public for suckers. He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat. Romney hypocritically criticized Trump for not releasing tax returns, something the 2012 Republican nominee refused to do himself four years ago well into his race against President Obama, who went on to win a second term.Then he attacked Trump s foreign policy, focusing in particularly on his plan to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. Mr. Trump s bombast is already alarming our allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies. Insulting all Muslims will keep many of them from fully engaging with us in their urgent fight against ISIS, and for what purpose? Muslim terrorists would only have to lie about their religion to enter the country. Romney ended by urging Republicans to vote for someone who can beat Hillary Clinton.Here s the video of Romney s speech via YouTube:Well, it didn t take long for Donald Trump to fire back, and his response was devastating.Right out of the gate Trump reminded Romney that he lost in 2012 to President Obama and was a terrible candidate overall.It then Trump proceeded to humiliate Romney even further by telling of how the former Republican nominee begged for his endorsement. I don t know what happened to him. You can see how loyal he is. He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said Mitt  drop to your knees.  He would have dropped to his knees.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""I ve been saying for a long time now that the Republican Party was on the verge of splitting   and I was right. Sort of. I always assumed that the establishment would control the party with an iron fist and the Tea Party white supremacists would abandon the GOP to form their own White Power party. But with the rise of Donald Trump, it looks like the establishment is going to abandon the party and run a candidate that s not a raving sociopath:Spurred by Donald J. Trump s mounting victories, a small but influential   and growing   group of conservative leaders are calling for a third-party option to spare voters a wrenching general election choice between a Republican they consider completely unacceptable and Hillary Clinton.While he has gained intense popularity on the right, Mr. Trump has alienated key blocs in the Republican coalition with his slash-and-burn campaign. For many, his initial refusal last weekend to disavow an endorsement from David Duke, the white supremacist, was a breaking point. Breaking point  my ass. The only problem conservative leaders have with Trump s racism is the overt nature of it. Republicans have relied on white resentment for 50 years to win elections, but they ve had to keep it concealed lest they get publicly torn apart for being the party of old white racists. The corporate media was happy to promote this fiction but Trump is making that impossible. THAT S the real problem Republicans have with Trump. That, and he s an uncontrollable buffoon, unlike George W. Bush who was the perfect puppet for the 1% to manipulate.But think about it for a moment: The conservative movement is so appalled by their own front-runner that they re going to deliberately sabotage their own party to keep Trump out of office. The lunatics have officially taken control of the asylum.William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine, said he would work actively to put forward an  independent Republican  ticket if Mr. Trump was the nominee, and floated Mr. Sasse as a recruit. That ticket would simply be a one-time, emergency adjustment to the unfortunate circumstance (if it happens) of a Trump nomination,  Mr. Kristol wrote in an email. It  would support other Republicans running for Congress and other offices, and would allow voters to correct the temporary mistake (if they make it) of nominating Trump. Kristol is many things, but stupid is not one of them. He knows full well that running another conservative would hand the election to the Democratic nominee on a silver platter. The fact that the presumptive nominee is Hillary Clinton, the most hated woman in the conservative world, doesn t even seem to be a factor.Max Boot, a foreign policy adviser to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, said that if efforts to block Mr. Trump fell short, he would vote against a Republican nominee for the first time in his life. I would sooner vote for Josef Stalin than I would vote for Donald Trump,  said Mr. Boot, who expressed optimism that Mr. Trump could still be defeated. He added:  There is no way in hell I would ever vote for him. I would far more readily support Hillary Clinton, or Bloomberg if he ran. I wonder how the frothing masses of Hillary Clinton hating liberals will take this kind of news? One of their most precious narratives is that Trump will easily beat Clinton because Republicans hate her more than anything therefor she can t be allowed to be the nominee. So much for that myth. Also, it wasn t true in the first place:Defections of any scale could prove lethal to Mr. Trump. He already trails Mrs. Clinton in general election polls, and polling already shows the possibility of mass desertions from the party. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey this week found that 48 percent of Republicans who do not already back Mr. Trump said they would probably not or definitely not support him in November.When asked about the possibility of a revolt from the not-completely-insane wing of the party, Trump replied with his typical 4th grade eloquence, They ll just lose everything, and that would be the work of a loser. Oddly, a third party would actually hurt the Democrats in the general election. While it would deliver us the White House with ease, it would bring out voters would have otherwise stayed home in disgust. They would almost certainly vote down ticket, making Senate, House and local elections harder to win for Democratic candidates. On the other hand, it would represent a schism in the Republican Party they might not be able to recover from so it s hard to know if we should be cheering this plan or not.Featured image via

They hear about his hatred of Muslims and Mexicans and come running in droves. His plans: a wall, the best wall; healthcare, the best healthcare; military, the best military; education, the best education; guns. He literally offers no specifics. He just says what comes to mind and these imbecilic supporters cheer. Watch any rally and you ll soon realize that he s not running for the nation, he s running for himself. Count how many times he mentions polls. Notice how few times he mentions legitimate policy ideas. Keep track of how many times he uses  me,   my  or  I. This vagueness is working though, because while at a diner in Nashville, Tennessee, Anna Kooiman of Fox News spoke with a Trump supporter by the name of Austin who said Trump is a  proven businessman who has employed tens of thousands of people, he s a man that knows how to get the job done right. Austin is basically just repeating, verbatim, what Trump says at every single one of his rallies and events. Trump proclaims over and over that he is a  great  businessman who has  employed tens of thousands of people  and  knows how to get the job done right.  It s pretty much guaranteed that he ll say this at the next debate as well.When Kooiman pressed this Trump supporter on why he thinks Trump isn t specific on any policy, he replied: I am not concerned about that. I think he is not being specific so he does not give his competition everything that he s doing so they copy him. And Fox News being Fox News, Kooiman said,  There s a great theory there and he s a dealmaker. So, let s get this straight, Trump isn t being specific because he doesn t want people to copy him? That s his grand plan to lure voters. That s like a salesman saying,  I have this thing, and you re gonna love it, I just can t tell you what it is until you buy it.  Who in their right mind would buy something they know nothing about? Apparently, this guy Austin in Nashville.Trump really wasn t kidding when he said he loves the  poorly educated.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""The United States Supreme Court is currently debating one of the most important bills on abortion in the past two decades.The bill from Texas, which former Democratic Texas State Senator Wendy Davis famously filibustered in 2013, would grant doctors admitting privileges at hospitals for abortions, and clinics would be forced to upgrade facilities to hospital standards, which would force abortion clinics outside of highly populated metropolitan areas to close their doors, leaving about 10 clinics left in the state.Three female supreme court justices, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan led the questioning against Republican Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller over the impacts the bill would have, particularly on women from low income backgrounds.The debate is the first major decision in the United States Supreme Court since the death of Antonin Scalia. As one seat on the Supreme Court remains unfilled, a 4-4 tie over the bill is very likely. If that were to happen, the bill would be allowed to go into effect in Texas, but not set a precedent nationally. If a split occurs, the debate could also be brought back to the Supreme Court when the seat is filled.When Keller made the argument some abortion clinics would still allow to be opened in the state, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg rebuked,  How many women are located over 100 miles from the nearest clinic?  Keller cited New Mexico as a location for some women under that category to use, which Ginsburg then pointed out New Mexico does not have the same provisions as the Texas law. If your argument is right, then New Mexico is not an available way out,  she said.Justice Elena Kagan cited the Texas bill would disenfranchise over 900,000 women who live 150 miles away or more from an abortion clinic in the state. She also cited 750,000 women live more than 200 miles away, but before the law was passed in Texas, that number was 10,000.Justice Sotomayor challenged Keller over whether the changes would yield any slight health improvement, and if that was worth burdening the lives of millions of women in Texas.The Justice who could break the 4-4 tie is Anthony Kennedy, whose vote could either strike down the bill 5-3, or give the conservative justices the 4-4 tie to keep the debate open, which would give the GOP even more incentive to stall a Supreme Court Justice nomination from President Barack Obama.The past few years, Texas  GOP has led a legislative war on abortion clinics. Under the guise of improving women s health and safety, the bill is just another measure to make it more difficult for a woman to undergo an abortion by eliminating access. Prior to 2014, there were 40 abortion clinics in the state. After some provisions of the anti-abortion law went into effect after it was passed in 2013, the number was cut in half. If the bill is allowed to pass, the number would drop down again to ten, all solely located around Texas  biggest cities.The Supreme Court is expected to come to a decision by late June.Featured image via Addicting Info""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

According to the indictment being brought against him, Delemus was  a mid-level leader and organizer of the conspiracy who, among other things: recruited, organized, trained and provided logistical support to gunmen and other followers and organized and led armed patrols and security checkpoints. Delemus s connection to Trump is certainly a factor, but it s also damaging to the Republican party as a whole. Jerry s wife, Susan Delemus, is a GOP lawmaker in the state of New Hampshire s House of Representatives. News of the incident first broke when Susan called Jack Kimball, the former chairman of the New Hampshire GOP to let him know that the FBI was raiding their house. Here s what Kimball wrote on Facebook:  She said that the FBI just rolled up with lots of vehicles and Agents who were in tactical gear. They forced their way into Jerry Delemus and Sue s condo with weapons drawn and arrested Jerry and took him away. Currently, the FBI is not taking questions on the matter and is asking that anyone needing more information to get in contact with the Department of Justice. As of right now, the U.S. DOJ has not gotten back in touch with local newspaper Portsmouth Patch, who reported on it first.Here is a list of the charges Delemus is currently being faced with:In addition to taking part in the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Preserve in Oregon, Delemus was a security team member on the Bundy Ranch in Nevada.Even though these charges are quite serious (and factual) it s likely the right is going to chalk this up as retaliation for being either 1) a Trump supporter or 2) because of their anti-government beliefs.Delemus s wife had already been an outspoken proponent of big government and lying politicians, even before the FBI ransacked her home. That is, everyone but Trump. You may remember her face from a recent CNN survey she did, in which she professed her ardent support for the man:  We ve got people in positions of power who I know for a fact are liars. Liars! I watch the TV   My president comes on the TV and he lies to me! I know he s lying. He lies all the time.  Trump supporter:  I believe Donald. I m telling you   he says what I m thinking.  https://t.co/K0KNfPh6Gp @CNNPolitics  Eugene Scott (@Eugene_Scott) December 10, 2015No, Delemus was not arrested because of his  Trump  beliefs. If that was the case the FBI would have hauled her crazy ass off with him and thrown her in a jail cell, too.Featured image via screen capture.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Partnership School took a cellphone video of a school resource officer brutally assaulting a high school sophomore on Tuesday, and now the city s top school cop and two others have been placed on leave.The sickening video shows a police officer slapping the teenager in his face three times, kicking him and cursing at him. Another officer, a female, can be seen standing behind the abusive officer doing absolutely nothing to stop the attack.When officials saw the video they placed the officers and Baltimore School Police Chief Marshall Goodwin on PAID administrative leave until the investigation into the incident can be completed. Yes, that s right, the cop beat this child and he is still being paid.Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she was  appalled  by the officers  behavior: As a parent of a Baltimore city school student, I was appalled by what I saw. The behavior that was demonstrated   is certainly something you never want to see.   Certainly not a school officer acting in this way, particularly with a young person. Meanwhile, the city school system is trying to blame the kid for his assault because he wasn t a student at Reach! saying, His presence at the school and the series of events before and after the incident are currently under investigation. His family s attorney Lauren Geisse, however, is saying that is not true: The boy had a right to be at the school where he was an enrolled student. With respect to refusing to leave the school, the student didn t want to leave the school where he had a right to attend. Attorney Michael Davey who represents the police officer who is seen hitting the student claimed his client was responding to a call of an intruder on campus and explained away the video by saying only a few seconds of the incident were captured. As if that somehow makes it perfectly okay that a grown man was hitting and kicking a teenage boy in the face.The school system s CEO, Gregory Thornton is calling the officer s assault on the child  unacceptable : I am completely appalled and disappointed by what is depicted in the video. Our school police officers are entrusted with ensuring the safety of our students and staff, and I know that most of them take this job seriously while maintaining a high level of professionalism. The behavior in the video is completely unacceptable. He is absolutely correct. Frankly, there is absolutely no excuse for a police officer to his ANYONE that way, let alone a child. And it is appalling that he is still being paid after this. This kid suffered injuries to his face and his ribs and this guy is allowed to just collect a paycheck while hanging out at home. WTF is that about?If  peace  officers do not know how to control their tempers, they have no business wearing a badge. And if they do lose their temper and hurt someone, they damn sure don t deserve to be paid while the investigation is completed. That s outrageous.

At the moment, conservatives in almost every state are spending enormous amounts of energy passing so-called  guns everywhere  bills that allow people to go to places like bars, national parks, churches, and schools strapped with a firearm. They say this will keep people safe because more guns means more  good guys with guns. But when it comes to their own events, their opinion suddenly drastically changes. Thousands of Tea Party  patriots  and conservative fanatics crammed into a small conference center? Organizers would rather they left their guns at home. After all, they may be hypocrites, but they re not suicidal!Republicans have flocked to the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Maryland to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference, one of the biggest Republican events of the year. At the event, attendees will hear right-wing talking points spoken by some of their favorite Republican politicians and drilled into their heads over loudspeakers. Without a doubt, CPAC will feature lots of pro-gun mania. A few years ago, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was actually given a musket on stage to the delight of the audience. (Yeah, CPAC is really weird.)But this year before they can get in, attendees are greeted with this sign.At CPAC there will be no good guys with guns :/ pic.twitter.com/Kn8tUWyubs  Betsy Woodruff (@woodruffbets) March 3, 2016They then must walk through a metal detector just to ensure they aren t still bearing arms.Why ban guns? Well, because having that many gun carriers packed into a small area practically begs a tragedy to happen. Whether by accident or on purpose, the chances of a shooting skyrocket. This year will be particularly tense, because the Republican Party is in the process of imploding. Trump fans, known for roughing up their critics, and Republican establishment fans, known for hating Trump, will be crammed into Standing Room Only venues. Weapons are the last thing these people need.Inside, they ll probably feel a bit naked without their guns, but they will be covered head-to-toe in hypocrisy. Gun free zones are for  liberal  places like churches, universities, and elementary schools. This is CPAC, where conservatives can roam in the comfort of their own warped ideology. Everyone should have a Bible in their breastpocket and a gun on their hip. Conceding that guns make a place dangerous is counter to their most sacred belief: Guns keep us safe.It s unclear whether the  no guns allowed  policy came from CPAC organizers or the convention center they rented. Either way, it looks bad. Republicans want guns to be around school children   but can t tolerate them during their weekend event.Featured image via Flickr ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In the letter, the concerned GOPers warned that if given the chance, President Trump would  make America less safe  and  diminish our standing in the world. The letter, in part, reads: Mr. Trump s own statements lead us to conclude that as president, he would use the authority of his office to act in ways that make America less safe, and which would diminish our standing in the world.Furthermore, his expansive view of how presidential power should be wielded against his detractors poses a distinct threat to civil liberty in the United States.As committed and loyal Republicans, we are unable to support a Party ticket with Mr. Trump at its head. We commit ourselves to working energetically to prevent the election of someone so utterly unfitted to the office. The letter was organized by former State Department official Eliot Cohen and former Mitt Romney adviser Bryan McGrath and was published by national security news site War on the Rocks as the GOP reached a record-high panic after Trump s success on Super Tuesday. Cohen said of the letter, This is really drawing a bright moral line and saying that if we re going to keep our souls we can t cross it. The letter is 454 words long, with signers blasting Trump for his  expansive use of torture,  his  hateful, anti-Muslim rhetoric,  and his not-so-subtle crush on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump s proposal to make Mexico build a wall on its border also came under fire, as did his suggestion that Japan pay for military protection, stating that Trump was more like a  racketeer  than an ally.Max Boot, a foreign policy adviser to Mitt Romney s 2012 campaign and one of the letter s signers, said: I would sooner work for (North Korean dictator) Kim Jong Un than for Donald Trump. I think Donald Trump is objectively more dangerous than Kim Jong Un and not as stable. By refusing to support the Republican ticket if Trump is the party s nomination, these 60+ signers are waiving any possibility that they would obtain a high-level position with the Trump administration. McGrath stated that this open letter didn t necessarily mean that the signers would be voting for a Democratic president, but noted that some of his colleagues said they had no other choice.

The girl had died a slow and agonizing death from severe malnutrition and an untreated broken femur.Her mother, 34-year-old Krisla Rezireksyon Kris underwent an assessment by clinical psychologists at Essex County Jail this week, during which she told mental health professionals that she became  extremely religious  prior to her daughter s death, and began following ever stricter lifestyle rules in an aim to become become  more godly, more spiritual. This involved keeping to a strict and limited diet, regularly fasting, and the avoidance of all modern healthcare   as she felt doctors and medicine do  the work of the devil .In reality, she was starving herself and her children to death, and putting them at great risk of death by treatable disease and illness.This week, Joel Morgan, a clinical neuropsychologist who assessed Kris, testified that she was suffering a mental disorder at the time, and not acting with the intention of hurting her children. Morgan argues that Kris was suffering a mental health crisis which made her vulnerable to the predations of an exploitative Pastor. Further, that this Pastor manipulated Kris into adopting the rules which ultimately killed her child, at the same time as extracting money from her. He stated: She adopted his way of life. She became a zealot and empowered him with having judgment over her and her children in terms of daily activities, prayer, diet, medical health, everything, Despite the testimony, evidence of Kris  educational and employment records was put forward to argue that the mother was of above average intelligence, and functioning well in life at the time of her alleged crimes.Whatever the outcome of the trial, a child is dead, and two others endured a horrible torment and now need to adjust to life without their mother.

Duke whined that former West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd was also in the KKK but he was never introduced as such, accusing the  mainstream media  of being controlled.However, while Duke is right that Byrd was in the KKK, Byrd did repeatedly renounce his KKK ties later in his career, calling it a mistake that he ll keep apologizing for  over and over again. I know now I was wrong,  Byrd said in 2005.  Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times   and I don t mind apologizing over and over again. I can t erase what happened. In 1997, Byrd warned young people to steer clear of the KKK.  Don t get that albatross around your neck,  he said.  Once you ve made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena. Byrd became a staunch supporter of civil rights and redeemed himself over time.This makes Byrd far different from Duke, who has not renounced his KKK past and his continued support of white supremacy. When asked about how he feels about Jews and black people, Duke had a hard time answering and then said that he is trying to turn the KKK into a political organization and fancies himself a  human rights activist.  Of course, the only human rights he cares about are those of racist white pricks like himself.Malzberg also challenged Duke with his own words, asking him about what he said about rape laws in 1975.According to the Wichita Sun Duke said, White people don t need a law against rape, but if you fill this room up with your normal black bucks, you would, because n***ers are basically primitive animals. Duke claimed he was taken out of context and that the Sun made up the quote, only to later brag about how the Republican Party has adopted his stance against immigrants.In the last part of the interview, Duke continued to talk about himself and how great he is, even going so far as to scream that Trump  jumped ten points in the polls  because he and  his people  (white racists) to support him.Here s the videos via YouTube.Trump has made it possible for white supremacists and their racist organizations to rise up in this nation once again. And should he win, those evil groups and their members will have an ally in the White House, which will only embolden them.

On Wednesday, The Donald laid out a seven-point plan, which is so lacking in detail and void of specifics that a high school student could fit the entire thing on one page, double spaced even.So   what s the first thing he wants to do? By getting rid of Obamacare altogether, as he says, Trump will allow insurers to discriminate once again against people with pre-existing conditions, giving insurers the option not to provide coverage as they see fit, along with all the other protections Obamacare provides. For a full list of those shelters, visit HERE. Trump has said in the past that he would replace the pre-existing condition rule with something else, something  much greater  but he must have forgotten about that promise because he didn t offer any alternatives, not in this one-page plan.While Obamacare may seem complicated to some, getting rid of common sense provisions like this should alarm every American. And, Trump isn t alone on this. Paul Ryan, the new Speaker of The House, was forced to admit that popular rules like this (even among Republican voters) would end up going away along with Obamacare.So   that s number one   gut anything and everything, even if it makes sense   just because it s something Obama came up with. Got it.What else is in there?Trump wants to allow insurers to compete across state lines. You might remember this if you watched the debate last week, where Rubio got the applause of the night for making fun of Trump about it. This was before Trump made his entire plan available, and the only thing he could think of was this aspect of it.  Get rid of the state lines,  you could hear him say, over and over.It s possible this is the only real part of Donald Trump s plan that he cares about. After all, this was the only part he could remember when called out on the debate stage in front of everyone.The other remaining 5 points of Trump s plan, are as follows:Healthcare reform is much more complicated than this, however. This seven-point plan doesn t tell us much. All it really says is what Republican voters want to hear.And   here s another doozy. He made a statement trying to link his strict immigration policies as being one factor in limiting the cost of health insurance for illegal immigrants, but what he really did was admit that illegal immigrants only cause a tiny fraction of the total cost of healthcare. Donald Trump says illegal immigrants cost the U.S. $11 billion annually, but total health care spending in the U.S is around $2.9 trillion. That s not even a drop in the bucket. This is just further proof, straight from the source, that illegals aren t driving up the cost of healthcare like Republicans claim.It s possible that the real reason Trump s plan is so short is because he s perfectly happy with insurance companies filling in the small details instead of the government. We ve already been there and done that.

It was beautiful to watch.O Reilly attempted to seek advice from Koppel on how best to approach an interview with Donald Trump. The Republican front runner is known for being brash, aggressive and evasive. O Reilly put it to his former colleague,  Not an easy interview. How would you do it? But Koppel wasn t having the fake sincerity. O Reilly, and his ilk at Fox, created this monster. You and I have talked about this general subject many times over the years. It s irrelevant how I would do it. You know who made it irrelevant? You did. You have changed the television landscape over the past 20 years   you took it from being objective and dull to subjective and entertaining. And in this current climate, it doesn t matter what the interviewer asks him; Mr. Trump is gonna say whatever he wants to say, as outrageous as it may be. Thanks to people like O Reilly, who routinely ignore facts to push a right-wing agenda, Trump can get away with saying anything he wants and the gullible Fox audience will eat it up. Facts no longer matter because they ve been told for years that the truth has a liberal bias anyway.When O Reilly ignored the critique, Koppel again went for the throat. He suggested Fox might try to counter Trump, and this might sound crazy to a guy like O Reilly,  by some reporting. It s an old-fashioned concept, but I think demonstrating who and what Mr. Trump is and what his policies really amount to is something you don t do in an interview. He doesn t answer the questions. Letting Trump control the interview doesn t work. MSNBC tried it with their townhall and it was a complete disaster. Trump is a showman, what he lacks in substance he makes up for in empty bravado. Instead, Koppel told O Reilly, try actually exposing the truth for once.It s refreshing to see someone so unequivocally call Bill O Reilly out right to his face. It helps that it comes from a long-time veteran of the news business.

The original story can also be read on the New York Times website under the headline,  New Popular Leader Rises In Bavaria. Out of curiosity, I found the first NYT reference to Adolf Hitler. Nov. 21, 1922. Amazing last three paragraphs. pic.twitter.com/VhBnlSsfNm  Jon Ostrower (@jonostrower) March 2, 2016The article starts off by noting,  This reactionary Nationalistic anti-Semitic movement has now reached a point where it is considered potentially dangerous, although not for the immediate future.  Trump s foray into presidential politics was of course greeted by derision, as both Democrats and Republicans assumed there wasn t any serious constituency for Trump s buffoonish act. But within the Republican Party, there is a clear appetite for his brand of nonsense mixed in with a heavy dose of racism and xenophobia.Taking note of the Hitler supporters who  beat up protesting Socialists and Communists  the article rings true as we are treated daily to Trump rallies where supporters have been encouraged by the candidate and his campaign goons to rough up disruptive protesters, or in some cases, perfectly quiet protesters who happened to be black.But it is the closing paragraphs of the article that have so many matching up the reporting on Hitler to Trump. It reflects a view of Hitler and Jews that through the lens of history sounds disgustingly optimistic:But several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed he idea that Hitler s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic an in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes.A sophisticated politician credited Hitler with peculiar political cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism, saying:  You can t expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims. You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism. It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you are really leading them. We are faced with a political candidate who insists a large swath of Latinos are  rapists,  who urges registration and bans of Muslims, and who has called for the execution of black men that were falsely accused of rape. And he has already inspired acts of violence against minorities, and his most ardent supporters are often within or sympathetic to the white power movement. Trump himself refused to immediately disavow an endorsement from the Ku Klux Klan in a TV interview.It isn t a stretch to see the parallels between this historical reporting and those who insist Trump s rhetoric is just rhetoric.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Rather than take the high road or, better yet, analyze his own actions to figure out why people despise him, Hannity did what comes naturally to him: He threw a very public, very embarrassing temper tantrum.Here s what Caputo said, quoted from an anonymous Rubio staffer, that set Hannity off: \""But Marco gives Donald a taste of his own medicine and Hannity gets all offended. He's a pussy and a sellout.\"" Boy, they're angry 2/2  Marc Caputo (@MarcACaputo) March 2, 2016Crass? Sure. Accurate? Definitely. It s no secret that Hannity has been a big fan of Donald Trump s since the very beginning. He once bragged that he encouraged Trump to get into the presidential race in 2012. He s been a major cheerleader ever since. In February, Trump was facing serious accusations about courting white supremacists   so he booked a 30 minute softball interview with his friend Hannity and  the issue never even came up. Instead, the two shared some laughs, complimented each other, and generally behaved as if it was a Trump 2016 infomercial paid for by Fox News.So when it came to defending his reputation against this charge of favoritism, Hannity simply ignored his indefensible actions and lashed out. Hilariously, Hannity didn t blame Rubio s campaign staffer so much as the reporter who relayed the message. On Twitter, the conservative pundit went a bit nuts.He tried  I know you are, but what am I? Glad Politico let's u use such big words that accurately describes yourself asshole.

In 2014, Mediaite ran a survey asking  several dozen cable news hosts from Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC  what they felt about their fellow pundits.

I am extremely proud of the collaborative spirit of the stakeholder groups that worked to develop this legislation. Oregon has not only avoided a number of potentially problematic ballot measures, we have taken a very smart approach in a way that makes sense for workers and for businesses no matter where in Oregon they are. On Facebook, Brown wrote that the new law will  ensure hard-working Oregonians get a much-needed raise in order to keep up with rising costs of rent, food, and other necessities. Even President Obama praised the new wage hike in a statement via the White House, and called upon Congress to do the same for the rest of the nation.I commend the Oregon Legislature and Governor Kate Brown for taking action to raise their state s minimum wage. Since I first called on Congress to increase the federal minimum wage in 2013, 18 states and the District of Columbia have acted on their own. These efforts will boost the paychecks of hardworking Americans and help support millions of workers trying to make ends meet. Today, more than half of our states guarantee their workers a wage higher than the federal minimum. That s progress. But Congress needs to keep up with the rest of the country. They need to act, and finally give America a raise. And until they do, I ll continue to encourage states, cities, counties and companies to act on their own to support hardworking families.This is a great day for Oregon workers, who must be a little more excited than usual to go to work now that they know they ll be taking home much more needed income to provide for themselves and their families.The same cannot be said for most of Republican-controlled Alabama and other red states. Republicans there recently passed a law banning counties and cities from increasing the minimum wage within their own boundaries, making clear that they have no intention of raising the minimum wage in that state for the foreseeable future.So while people in Oregon can have hope that the future will be financially brighter, people in Alabama are struck and that s why it doesn t make sense for people to vote for Republicans.

To forestall the usual whining: Bernie True Believers  are not EVERY Bernie supporter. Most of them are normal, rational people that want Bernie but will vote blue no matter who wins because a Republican president is unthinkable right now.

That their high horse would be burning along with everyone else never seems to occur to them. But at least their soul is unsullied so who cares? Got it, #NotAllBernieSupporters, now get over it and move on.After pleas from Bernie supporters for Warren to endorse Sanders went unanswered, angry True Believers swarmed her facebook pages to denounce her:Dennis Flannigan: I m losing all respect for you.You re showing yourself to be just another wave-riding professional politician.That means you re part of the problem.Endorse Bernie now or go away!JoAnne Tyler: I am done with you, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren.

You could ve endorsed Bernie before today and made an actual difference in this election but you were too scared. All that tough talk is nothing without action. Taking my money and endorsements elsewhere.Elizabeth Warren is possibly the most hated person on Wall Street. So of COURSE she s been bought off by the banksters because she didn t endorse Sanders. Makes perfect sense.Every time I post about the True Believers and how very much like the Tea Party sounded as they were getting started, I get chastised for cherry picking just a few random malcontents. But guess what? There are literally hundreds upon hundreds of these posts and stop by any pro-Bernie group and you ll find an unending stream of the same vitriol. It s even worse on the pro-Bernie pages because there s so little push back inside their little bubble. If they were such a tiny minority, they would be shouted down. Buuuuuuuuut they re not.The worst part about all of this is that Bernie himself has made it absolutely clear that he d vote for Clinton in a heartbeat before allowing any Republican in the White House.

Because the solar panels often put energy back into the grid, utility companies like the ones Warren Buffett owns wind up paying those residents for energy. Nevada Senator Harry Reid in regards to Buffet s company told the Las Vegas Sun, looking at this as a lawyer, my personal feeling is that this is a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Buffett s lobbying efforts pushed Nevada s utility regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, to remove incentives for homeowners to have solar panels, making solar power once again unaffordable for Nevada residents. The decision effectively derailed the fastest growing market for solar power in the country.A petition for Buffet to ease his opposition to solar power was signed by over 100,000 renewable energy advocates in protest. Actor Mark Ruffalo, who called the public utility commission,  the anti-Robin Hood, also participated in the protests.At the end of 2015, Solar City ceased operations and installations in Nevada as a result of the Public Utilities Commission decision, resulting in the loss of 550 jobs. The decision could set a precedent across the country in opposition of solar power, which not only has been championed by billionaire Warren Buffett, but the Koch brothers as well, over the argument solar power makes the market place unfair for competitors.Koch advocacy groups didn t directly enter the fight in Nevada between Elon Musk s Solar City and Warren Buffett s utility companies, but they have lobbied in nearby states against incentives for solar power.In Florida, which has the third best solarity of any state in the country, the Koch Brothers have led efforts to keep solar power out of the state to protect electricity sales of investor owned utilities, as it remains ranks 16th in the nation in solar production. For investors, more infrastructure on the electric grid yields more profits, but solar power directly threatens those profits. In Florida, the average household pays more than 40 percent higher for electrical consumption than the national average. 61 percent of Florida s electricity generation comes from natural gas, and 23 percent from coal.The Koch s grassroots political group, Americans For Prosperity, called for Florida to fight against the choice for Solar. Many organizations who have received millions in donations from the Koch Brothers helped struck down an initiative to open up Florida to solar power on voters  ballots in 2016, including 60 Plus and the National Black Chamber of Commerce, whose latest convention was sponsored by Koch Industries.  Despite the lobbying efforts of the Koch Brothers, solar power has bipartisan support, as the ballot initiative to open up solar power in Florida was led by tea party founder Debbie Dooley, who now directs the group, Conservatives for Energy Freedom.As Solar power becomes more accessible and affordable for Americans, utility companies and their investors, especially the most powerful ones such as Warren Buffet and the Koch brothers, are obstructing solar s growth through lobbying state governments. Despite the obstructions, solar power is gaining bipartisan support across the nation. Let s say if the only thing we had was solar energy if that was the only power source if you just took a small section of Spain you could power all of Europe,  said Elon Musk in a speech at Sorbonne University in Paris this past December.  It s a very small amount of area that s actually needed to generate the electricity we need to power civilization. Or in the case of the U.S., like a little corner of Nevada or Utah would power the United States. The technology exists to harness the energy from the sun, which more of hits the Earth in one hour than humanity uses in an entire year. Sooner or later relics of old capitalism like Warren Buffett and the Koch Brothers are going to have to join the 21st century in this transition to renewable energy.Featured Image Courtesy of Occupy Democrats""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They need hearts that are open to the mercy of God. It is far from the Pope s first intervention on the matter of unrestrained and crony Capitalism that has come to define (at least) the last thirty years of human history. Last Summer, the Pope referred to the global dominance of Capitalism s 1% as the  new colonialism in a speech in Bolivia   pointing to the removal of liberty, human rights and opportunity created by gross inequality and the resulting centralization of wealth and power. He continued: In this third world war, waged piecemeal, which we are now experiencing, a form of genocide is taking place, and it must end. Throughout his time as Pontiff, Pope Francis has continued to exercise the message of New Testament Jesus. A personal show of compassion, and a determination to enable poor and vulnerable people to make the best possible lives for themselves, and the widest possible contribution to their communities.What is so interesting about this though, is that the political party that considers itself the party of God on earth, the Republican Party, asset there delivering the opposite message.Somewhere along the line, Young Republicans confused Atlas Shrugged with the Bible and it s radical right-wing author Ayn Rand for Jesus. Republicans don t worship Jesus, they worship Ayn Rand. Republicans don t preach the gospel, they preach The Fountainhead. Instead of restraining the power of big business to hold unique influence over public and personal life, the Republican party has devoted itself to the opposite.Things have come to such a head, that Republican leaders are now openly denouncing the Pope and his interpretation of the Bible, rather than taking instruction from his leadership and questioning their own. In doing so, they are by their own definition, committing the sin of Pride   and we all know what pride comes before.

In this case, to designate a Winston-Salem post office the  Maya Angelou Memorial Post Office.  But even this small act of recognition of an African American of enormous cultural contribution was a step too far for 9 Republicans. As ABC News reports:Republican Reps. Mo Brooks of Alabama, Ken Buck of Colorado, Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, Glen Grothman of Wisconsin, Andy Harris of Maryland, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Michael Burgess of Texas, Steven Palazzo of Mississippi and Alex Mooney of West Virginia voted against the bill.A spokesperson for Rep. Andy Harris said the Maryland Republican voted against renaming the post office because Angelou was a  communist sympathizer. His parents escaped communism and he feels that he cannot vote to name a post office in the United States in honor of someone who supported the communist Castro revolution in Cuba,  the spokesperson said in a statement.  Who s next to get a post office? Jane Fonda? The gang of pro-Confederacy Republicans apparently sought revenge with their votes. They argued an equivalent between fighting against Angelou s Post Office, and opposition to memorializing public buildings in the name of Confederacy figures.What s sad about this, is that you really would have to be a bigot of the highest order to entertain the idea that Maya Angelou and the Dixie plantation owner who would have kept her as livestock, stand as equals in our history.Angelou s credentials as an American of great talent, wisdom and cultural contribution are without question. She never killed anybody, she never enslaved anybody. Her legacy was in words. Those words are still moving people after her body left the earth. She was the kind of hero that the American story really needs.As New York Democrat Steve Israel put it in a written statement: Naming post offices is one of the most benign and bipartisan duties we perform in the House of Representatives, and there is rarely any opposition, That s why I was shocked today as nine Republicans voted against naming a post office after Maya Angelou, indisputably one of our country s greatest poets, authors and civil rights activists. Unfortunately for the Republicans, the vote passed 371-9 (plus one Republican voting  Present ). So Maya Angelou will be honored, regardless of attempts to undermine the celebration of an American hero, simply because she happened to be African American.

So much so that they have allowed candidates like Trump, Cruz, and Rubio to rise to power within the party. They also hate and have refused to work with President Obama, and have hated Hillary Clinton even longer.Republicans even launched partisan investigations of Benghazi all in an effort to hurt Clinton at the polls.If anyone had told me a year ago that a Republican Senator will endorse Clinton for president in 2016, I would have had a good laugh for days.But as Super Tuesday unfolded last night, Chuck Todd announced he had heard  real speculation today from very informed people that at least one Republican Senate incumbent, if given a choice, might publicly endorse Hillary Clinton. Yes, you heard that right. The question of where have all the moderate Republicans gone has now been answered. So terrifying is the prospect that Trump could be president that Republicans are seriously looking at Hillary Clinton as the only choice to prevent insanity from taking over the government.Todd continued by explaining that it must be a Republican who is running in a blue state and that they may not really want to endorse Clinton but they need to do so in order to distance themselves from Trump and the disaster he represents for America and the GOP. An incumbent senator, there s at least one that I ve heard that could end up doing that, making that choice. Not because they want to, but because they need to send that message. Look, there s a bunch of them running for re-election in blue states, okay. That s what s going on here, and on the day that the Republican front-runner might cement his lead. Here s the video via YouTube.In other words, Republicans are beginning to understand that a Trump nomination could spell doom for other Republicans on the ticket, which means the Senate and the House are up for grabs. The Democrats could sweep to power in Congress, not just because Republicans are do-nothing obstructionists, but because their candidate for president is an extremist who is hurling racism, sexism, and hate at every rally much to the amusement of the conservative base.If a sitting Republican senator is truly willing to support Clinton simply for political survival, then it looks like the GOP is about to get their asses handed to them in November like never before. And then they ll definitely have to change their ways if they ever want to occupy the White House again.Featured image via Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Yes yes yes Feel the Bern, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is evil, Superdelegates are unfair, Hillary must have cheated, etc. etc. etc. Aside from all of that, it s clear Clinton has kept the Obama coalition more or less intact and that s going to land her the nomination. Without the support of the black community and non-millennial voters, Bernie s path to victory is extremely narrow and that s before you factor in the Superdelegates. If you don t believe me, then you should believe Nate Silver s fivethirtyeight.com, which has been the gold standard in political statistical analysis for the last several years.So Sanders should just quit and go home, right? Good lord, no! Even though he s losing the primaries, he s winning the debate and the Democratic Party still needs him. Badly.Love him or kind of like him (no one really hates him on the left), Sanders is correct when he says the Democratic Party is a little too cozy with Big Money. The problem is that while the corporate media loves LOVES to pretend that Democrats are just as far to the left as the GOP is to the right, that s total bullshit. The Democratic Party is comfortably to the left on social issues but center left (and just barely) when it comes to economics. This is a serious issue when it comes to making the necessary compromises with Republicans to get anything done. Any middle ground sits squarely to the right (which, of course, was the entire point of Republicans go so far to the fringe in the first place).What Bernie does, and does brilliantly, is drag the entire process to the left   and the Democratic Party with him. He ll never say it out loud, of course, but Bernie never really intended to win the primaries. His entire campaign is designed to influence politics on the left. This is heresy to the Bernie True Believers but let s be honest, Bernie has kept the Democratic Party at arm s length for decades, constantly poking at them like a gadfly. Winning the Superdelegates necessary to win the nomination was never an achievable goal and he s not even trying. Why? Because winning the election was not the goal, showing the Democratic Party that they can openly embrace Democratic Socialism and not be immediately burned at the stake was.And it s working. Very VERY well.In case you haven t noticed, Bernie Sanders openly advocating Socialism has not sent the country into shock. The corporate media keeps trying (poorly) to attack Sanders over this but he s so persistent and consistent with his message that the media s You re a Commie!  nonsense is getting drowned out. On top of that, the negative connotations of Socialism are completely lost on Millennials, AKA, the group of people that will be controlling politics in a decade or so.Bernie will continue to fight tooth and nail for every state he can because the higher his delegate count, the stronger his message is despite the lead Clinton has and will continue to hold even without the Superdelegates. When he concedes sometime in the summer (and he s got the war chest to go that far with ease), he will urge his followers to support Clinton and the Democratic Party but to continue to hold their feet to the fire. Clinton will have campaigned further to the left that she would have normally and for long enough that moving too far back to the center in the general election will hurt more than help.Like Obama, Sanders is playing a long game. He may not even be around to see the seeds he s planted take root but as long as he pulls Hillary and Democratic politics to the left (and he has), he s already won even if he s not the nominee.Featured image courtesy of Michael Vadon via wikimedia commons.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""While Republicans and their NRA puppet masters refuse to acknowledge it, we have a gun violence problem in America today. Almost like clockwork, anytime there is a shooting the right twists themselves into pretzels to blame anything but the easy availability of guns to, shall we say, crazy people.Each time, for instance, a  pro-gun  Republican shoots up a building, conservatives will fallaciously claim that he was a Black Lives Matter protester, or ignore their raving-mad right-wing rants and love of weapons, or claim the shooter was a  Progressive  because he was formerly employed by an insurance company by that name, or even say that a man who shot up a Planned Parenthood in an effort to stop abortion was a  transgendered leftist activist  who was trying to rob a bank. They spend so much time focusing on inventing stories that they completely miss the one trait all of these attacks share: the weapon used was a gun.While they ignore the issues, the right bellows that the solution is more guns, not fewer. But a recent study   the largest of its kind to date   puts that assertion largely to rest. A research team reviewed 130 high-quality studies conducted in ten countries over six decades and found that the tyrannical attempts by those of us on the left who want to restrict crazy people s access to guns because we are sick of seeing dead children on a daily basis, aren t at all misguided, as conservatives often claim.While researchers stopped short of saying they have proved conclusively that firearm restrictions reduce deaths, the study provides plenty of evidence to suggest this is the case. Across countries, instead of seeing an increase in the homicide rate, we saw a reduction,  lead researcher Julian Santaella-Tenorio from Columbia University told Vox. The study analyzed law changes in the United States, Australia, Austria, Brazil, South Africa, and other countries. No new data was collected. Instead, the researchers observed the big picture  by taking a look at what the data says when all the studies are examined together. Santaella-Teonorio explained: The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm deaths. The findings do not note one specific law that has caused gun violence to decrease like an assault weapon ban, or a ban on high-capacity magazines, because the diversity among countries makes this difficult. However, in countries that overhauled their firearm regulations broadly, the changes shared similar characteristics, according to the researcher:South Africa s Firearm Control Act of 2000, for example, contained all three of these measures, and a study of five South African cities found a 13.6 percent reduction in firearm homicides each year for the next five years. Reductions in nonfirearm homicides were also observed,  the researchers say,  although not as pronounced as the ones observed for firearm homicides. To combat mass shootings, Australia passed similar legislation in 1996. Thanks to the new laws, firearm homicide rates decreased by 4.8 percent, and suicides by 9.9 percent. There have only been two mass shootings in the country in the two decades since.But even the smallest changes, such as background check requirements and storage regulations, can have a huge impact.  Laws restricting the purchase of (e.g. background checks) and access to (e.g. safer storage) firearms are also associated with lower rates of intimate partner homicides and firearm unintentional deaths in children, respectively,  the researchers write.Of course, the weakening of firearm laws can have an impact as well. Following Missouri s decision to eliminate common-sense laws requiring people to have a permit to purchase a firearm, the state saw a homicide rate increase of 25 percent. No other changes in the law explain this increase. Stand Your Ground laws do nothing to reduce gun violence, but instead increase it (especially among white men): Stand your ground laws were associated with a 6.8% increase in homicide rates, mainly driven by increments (14.7%) in homicide rates among white males. While this can t be considered conclusive evidence that gun control helps limit fatalities, the study certainly provides enough evidence to give any Republican who can manage to operate a toaster without an adult supervising the operation pause to consider that maybe, just maybe, laws limiting firearms to people who aren t criminals, who aren t insane, and who aren t going to misuse them or act irresponsibly are in everyone s best interest   even the most staunch Second Amendment supporter.Featured image via QuickMeme""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Host Trevor Noah was understandably incredulous at the fact that this is even a thing. First, Noah addressed the fact that kids can already use hunting rifles, but not handguns, with adult supervision. He began by comparing this lunacy to the notorious hatred between Justin Beiber fans ( Beliebers ) and New Direction fans ( Directioners ): Beliebers vs. Directoners just got a whole lot more interesting. Noah then turned his attentions to kids who like to hunt: Some kids do like hunting. It s those kids who only like the first five minutes of Bambi. But then, things got downright scary, when Noah played a clip from a news station that detailed the intentions of Nathan Gibson, a gun nut who has been letting his kids use handguns since they were 5, even though it is illegal. He s now trying to make his illegal and dangerous actions with his own children the law of the land in the state of Iowa. Just to get this straight: Some guy picked up the phone and called a lawmaker and said  Hey, uh, my kids need guns.  And they were like,  Done!  And every day in America there s parents calling lawmakers saying,  Hey, my kids died because of guns.  And they re like,  Uhh, can you hold? Noah went on to described the absurdity of all of this in terms even a fool could understand (though I doubt the fools falling in line behind this dangerous nonsense will care). He began by asking,  Do you know what children are?  and showed clips of crying, tantrum-throwing kids. Who watches that and says,  Uh, I like that, but it s missing something.  After that, the clip was repeated, this time with gunfire. He ended on a chilling note: Oh, and by the way, that was under adult supervision. You do realize that. That kid was doing that under adult supervision. I love that the adult was like,  I m just gonna video this. Watch the video below:And this is why we should not allow gun nuts to make laws.

After being slammed for the failure to distance himself from a notorious racist, Trump concocted the claim that he was having problems with his earpiece and didn t hear the question.He made no such indication during the interview, and in fact repeated the terms  David Duke  and  white supremacist.

The problem is the behavior of some evangelical leaders,  Moore wrote. I have watched as some of these who gave stem-winding speeches about  character  in office during the Clinton administration now minimize the spewing of profanities in campaign speeches, race-baiting and courting white supremacists, boasting of adulterous affairs, debauching public morality and justice through the casino and pornography industries. Moore wasn t finished though. He also slammed evangelicals, a term he is too embarrassed to use to describe himself any longer, because they are flocking to candidates who pretend to be Christians. I watched one evangelical leader pronounce a candidate a Christian, though he explicitly states that he has never repented of sin, because he displays the fruit of the Spirit in job creation. That s not a political problem; it s a gospel problem.Why are many evangelical leaders, including some who pontificate on nearly everything else, scared silent as evangelicalism is associated with everything from authoritarianism and bigotry to violations of religious freedom? How can they look the other way in silence when politicians praise Planned Parenthood and demur about white supremacists and neo-Nazis? And then he admitted that liberals have been right about evangelicals for years and they have been vindicated by evangelicals who have flocked to Trump s campaign. For years, secular progressives have said that evangelical social action in America is not about religious conviction but all about power. They have implied that the goal of the Religious Right is to cynically use the  moral  to get to the  majority,  not the other way around.This year, a group of high-profile old-guard evangelicals has proven these critics right. Indeed, evangelical Christians have only sought power and they ve had no problem rewriting or flat-out ignoring parts of the Bible that do not fit with their agenda in order to achieve it.It s been all about money and power, and evangelical leaders have fleeced their congregations so they can keep trying to topple the government and establish religious tyranny. But evangelicals have grown more and more desperate over the years as Americans continually reject them and their radical agenda that would confine women to the home and sentence gay people to death as well as declare America a Christian state governed by the Bible instead of the constitutional principles we hold dear.And Donald Trump may not be an evangelical Christian, but evangelicals are increasingly supporting his campaign because he is saying exactly what they want to hear and they see him as their last chance to take power. It s never been about the gospel or morality to evangelicals. It has always been about gaining power and using it to persecute and indoctrinate those they disagree with. And by supporting Trump, evangelicals are telling the world that they are precisely the fake Christians that liberals have been fighting against for decades.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In reaction to his delegate lead and expected success on Super Tuesday, a cabal of high-dollar Republican donors had a conference call with one goal in mind: Stop Trump.Meg Whitman, Todd Ricketts and Paul Singer, among others, all took part in the call with about 50 people, urging them to fund Our Principles PAC, which was funded largely by a member of the Ricketts family, and which started airing ads in Iowa before the caucuses to try to stop Mr. Trump. The state is the only one that Mr. Trump has not won of the first four nominating contests. There are other entities looking to thwart Mr. Trump, but the call was primarily about Our Principles PAC, according to two participants, who asked not to be identified in order to talk about a private discussion.The call participants are largely previous bankrollers of Republican campaigns that were knocked out by Trump and his nativist pro-white campaign.But the New York Times reports that the effort to funnel campaign cash into an anti-Trump PAC still hasn t decided on a consensus anti-Trump candidate. The failure to decide on Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, or even John Kasich as the straight-up alternative to the reality TV star has split the  anti  vote and allowed Trump to continue to romp through the process.Putting money in a largely unregulated super PAC is no silver bullet either. Trump has already survived the well-funded Right to Rise super PAC, who backed Jeb Bush, which oddly spent much of its campaign war chest on anti-Rubio efforts, rather than targeting Trump.The panic call comes as a new CNN poll shows Trump losing badly to both Democratic candidates.

But, that didn t stop them from completely roasting the governor in truly epic fashion shortly after the occurrence. And   for that, we say, it made the strange affair all very well worth it.Given the recent stir about Trump s small hands, though, it s entirely possible Walker was joining in with Senator Marco Rubio and ganging up on him about it. Recently, Marco took off the gloves (pun intended) and started making fun of Trump s spray tan and even suggested he had a small pecker due to the size of his fingers. He s always calling me little Marco. And, I ll admit, he s taller than me, he s like 6 2. Which is why I don t understand why the size of his hands are from someone who s 5 2. And   you know what they say about men with small hands. They re probably only doing it because Trump has already made it known how much he hates it.

It seems that Rubio has finally caught onto this fact and is using it to his advantage, but no one can humble and put Trump in his place quite like President Barack Obama. It s worth bringing back an epic moment from five years ago, when Obama absolutely destroyed Trump with the utmost class at the White House Correspondents  Association dinner.The dinner was the day before the scheduled raid on Osama bin Laden s compound, and it was obvious that Obama was on point that night. Obama not only called Trump, Fox News and their fellow conservatives out on their birther conspiracies and ridiculous obsession with his birth certificate, but made them look like complete imbeciles in front of the entire audience   who was loving every second of it.Once Obama singled Trump out exclusively, The Donald practically tried to melt into his seat and he squirmed his way through the entire assault. When speaking about Trump s credentials and experience in political matters, Obama hilariously brought up Trump s behavior on the reality show Celebrity Apprentice and sarcastically complimented him on his  leadership.  Obama teased: Ultimately, you didn t blame Lil John, or Meatloaf. You fired Gary Busey. These are the kinds of decisions that would keep me up at night. Well handled, Sir. The audience was eating it up, but then Obama delivered the final blow.

It has come from many establishment Democrats during the 2016 primary season. Even Debbie Wasserman Schultz has used this theme in a statement released by her office, and she isn t even running in the primaries. This all makes it rather strange that with this in mind, Wasserman-Schultz has decided to help Republicans to destroy a very popular Obama-created governmental office of which he is very proud and voters absolutely love.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was set up by Elizabeth Warren after President Obama personally appointed her to do so, is coming under heavy attack by the ultra-predatory payday lending industry. The industry is also enjoying the assistance of Republicans and a few Democratic sellouts   which now includes Wasserman-Schultz among their number.The CFPB is approaching a point where they are going to be able to adopt better rules to protect consumers from predatory lending practices, which disproportionately harm the poorest among us and can throw an otherwise financially stable family into a long and sometimes inescapable cycle debt. This has caused the industry to rally Republicans to assault the CFPB by attacking its budget, burdening it with impossible amounts of regulation, and creating outright lies about the agency unilaterally shutting down businesses.Wasserman-Schultz is co-sponsoring a new bill that would completely gut the CFPB s approaching payday loan regulations and she is trying to lobby other Democrats in Washington to join her in this unprecedented attack on the poorest and most vulnerable Americans.The upcoming Republican sabotage is wrapped in a misleading name, the  Consumer Protection and Choice Act.  What exactly it has to do with protection and choice is not clear, since it actively blocks protections and poor people who are in desperate need tend to have no choice when it comes to resorting to a payday loan. The legislation would delay the CFPB s new regulations by two years, and would allow for state-level nullification of their federal authority in states that adopted their own laws regarding payday lenders. It s important to note that it doesn t have any classification for a level of protection of consumers   only that the state has adopted  a law  regarding payday lenders. It could be a mostly anti-consumer measure, but if it fulfills the letter of the law it would make it literally impossible for the CFPB to help an entire state.The Consumer Federation of America, the NAACP, The National Consumer Law Center, The National Council of La Raza, The Southern Poverty Law Center, and dozens of others sent letters to every member of Congress urging them to oppose the law. This isn t an online petition by regular people on some website. These are some of the biggest progressive social justice movements in America.A typical Florida payday loan customer takes out 9 loans per year and is stuck in debt for almost half that year. The average interest on Florida payday loans is 304 percent, which is less than the national average but still huge.Wasserman-Schultz is partially reacting to a state-level law she helped create in Florida, that her office claims  sharply reduced  the need to go after bad actors, curbed predatory practices, and created standards and protections for low-income borrowers.  The problem with this is, it simply isn t true. 76 percent of payday loans are  turned,  which means that they are made to help the borrower pay off a previous payday loan. This is exactly what the CFPB wants to help stop   a cycle of debt that the poor can t escape where they need to keep taking out loans to pay off previous ones.Debbie Wasserman Schultz is quickly becoming a pariah among Democrats. Her management of Democratic primary debates has garnered her a fair amount of infamy, and many have been calling for her to resign from her position as DNC chairperson. She will also be facing a primary challenge for her seat in the next election cycle.

He s openly admitting that he would back a KKK-loving presidential candidate over any Democrat.Here are his comments in full regarding what Trump had to say about the KKK: I think it s an unfortunate response. A very unfortunate response. Like I say, I ve met Mr. Trump once. It was a businesslike discussion and I walked away thinking he s been doing a great job as a showman out here and he s brought a lot of people into this thing. There was a side of him that I did not see when I visited with him personally.My choice would still be   honestly, I m still leaning to Marco Rubio, as I suspect there are others [who] are. But nonetheless, our critical issue is fixing things in the United States, and you can t do that if you ve got Bernie or Hillary, because they have a differing point of view about what s right and what s wrong with this country.And there are some things wrong with this country: [The Congressional Budget Office] is very clear within 10 years   the 250th birthday of our country, 2026   99 percent of all the revenues we collect will go to two categories: interest on the federal debt and mandatory payments on entitlements. You can t fix that unless you ve got a team in here agreed that you re focused on it. And I just don t think Democrats are going to do that. I think it has to be a Republican.Even if you re disappointed with the way he s responding to things, even if you re mad at him, you disagree with him, if he did it intentionally   I don t think he did, I think he just made a mistake   even if he did, they re still going to do a better job with him there than if you had Hillary or Bernie in his place. Rounds told reporter Todd Zwillich that Trump would boost voter turnout and at the end of the day  if he is the nominee, then will he bring more people out or won t he? You can call it transactional, but it s factual. Trying to mend fences, because he is one of the few people in a position to do so, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) condemned Trump s remarks. He said: When I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and as a country, I will speak up, so today I want to be very clear about something. If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry. This party does not prey on people s prejudices. We appeal to their highest ideals. This is the party of Lincoln. This is fundamental. And if someone wants to be our nominee, they must understand this. I hope this is the last time I need to speak out on this race. It seems Ryan is in deep denial of not only his own party, but of the base of voters that continuously votes Republican. As much as he wants to say the GOP is still the  Party of Lincoln,  they re not. That s been evident since the big party shift of the early 20th century when the South slowly went from Democrats to Dixiecrats to Republicans, and the Northern states went from Republican to Democrat. If Lincoln were around today, he d denounce the modern-day GOP and unquestionably back the Democratic nominee.

In fact, the only candidate that may give either Democratic candidate a run for their money would be Marco Rubio, but so far in this primary process he has yet to win one state, so the chances of that happening are little to none.

Needless to say, a Trump Republican nomination would handily lead to another Democrat in the White House.Here s the thing, though.

Host Jack Tapper asked Cruz about the recent attacks against Trump by other conservatives, especially presidential candidate Marco Rubio (R-FL). Not to be outdone, Cruz also had some choice words for Trump, blasting the front runner for standing behind Planned Parenthood, his plan to stay neutral between Israel and the Palestinians,  and  longtime support of expanding Obamacare into Bernie Sanders-style socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care, putting government bureaucrats into a position to ration your care, especially that of seniors. Cruz, absolutely terrified of what President Trump could mean for America, warned: If Donald becomes president, who the heck knows what he would do? Even Donald doesn t know what he would do. I think the challenges facing the nation, they re too grave to roll the dice. Cruz made it perfectly clear during this interview that he felt a Trump presidency would be the worst case scenario for America, but Tapper pressed him to see if he would still back his rival if Trump took the nomination. Cruz s answer is puzzling   after all the negative things he just said about Trump, Cruz still felt that: I will support the Republican nominee. Period. The end. This response by Cruz is absolutely infuriating and goes beyond stupidity. Cruz recognizes that Trump is dishonest, terribly offensive, unqualified and without question the wrong person to lead the country and will STILL advocate for him just because he s a Republican. Cruz should be wise enough to know that even though he doesn t want a Democrat president in the White House, America would be in far more capable hands and so much safer.You can watch the interview below:In another part of this interview, Tapper also asked the same question of candidate John Kasich (R-OH). Kasich echoed Cruz s opinion and said: At the end of the day, I m going to support that person who came through the arena and became the nominee. As insane as these responses from Cruz and Kasich are, they re not entirely to blame   the Republican National Committee is basically forcing them to back Trump if he wins the nomination, as every GOP candidate took a solemn oath to support whichever candidate wins the Republican party s nomination.It s so unfortunate that the GOP is so bitter about left-leaning politics that they would rather support a candidate that is going to destroy America than explore alternative possibilities with a more capable Democratic candidate. They cannot see far enough past their narrow-minded views and hateful rhetoric to see that the future of America will be greatly jeopardized with Trump, and they d rather watch it crash and burn than trust someone outside the GOP.

The Sands represent the beginning pangs of those looking to excuse Trump s worst attributes so they can support the dictator they want and still sleep at night.As the Sands themselves bring up, a lot of  good people  voted for Adolf Hitler in 1933, believing him to be an antidote to the dysfunctional German government at the time.

They are so scared that a group of high-ranking Republican governors held an emergency conference call to discuss it on Monday.Politico reported: Trump s march to the nomination has set off a wave of anxiety across the Republican Party establishment as top officials weigh whether to endorse him   or denounce him as anathema to the party s values. Reflecting that angst, on Monday morning, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the heads of the Republican Governors Association, convened fellow governors for an unusual conference call to discuss how the primary was unfolding   and Trump was a central topic of conversation. Apparently during the conference call, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin asked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie why he was supporting Trump. Christie, who has a long history of slamming Trump, claimed that he know believes Donald is the best man for the job. This is nonsense, of course; he just wanted to share some of Trump s limelight because like Trump, he is an opportunist and a liar.The real estate mogul has been wreaking havoc on the GOP since he entered the race. The party, which after the 2012 presidential race, decided that they needed an image makeover saw Trump destroy any chances of ever winning over minority voters. And in addition to his hatred for everyone who is not white, rich, or poorly educated, he has thumbed his nose at the establishment over and over. The reason many people think he has such an appeal with the GOP base (other than their insane racism and bigotry) is because he is not  a real politician. This belief that he is not a politician is more proof of how ignorant the Republican voter base really is. Trump says whatever he thinks will make people vote for him and has a long record of flip-flopping   like Mitt Romney in 2012, but on steroids.Former Republican National Committee chairman and former Florida senator, Mel Martinez has said that Trump is  increasingly unpalatable,  and said a majority of the party would resist him as the 2016 presidential candidate: How that manifests itself I don t know, but I believe there is a sense by many, myself included, that he just cannot be the nominee,  he said.  So a convention scenario could begin to develop. While the GOP isn t sure Trump should be their candidate, Americans have made it very clear that they have no interest in seeing him in the White House. Even the conservative site Red State recently published an article titled, A Vote For Trump is a Vote For Hillary Clinton: Why Trump Is A Sure Loser. Get your popcorn ready, folks. This infighting is going to make the Republican National Convention very interesting this summer, and it s looking better and better for Democrats in the Fall.

As it turns out, Donald Trump embodies all of these and all we have to do is listen to him talk to know that it s true.Noah then played various clips of Trump demonstrating each of these traits one by one. Afterwards, Noah let out a nervous laugh as the audience seemed to be in complete disbelief about what they just heard and witnessed. An actual American presidential candidate really did just spout stuff out of the fascist playbook before their eyes. I m shitting myself,  Noah said.  It all lines up so perfectly, doesn t it? It almost stops being funny as you re watching it. It s funny for me because I have a back-up plan country,  Noah quipped before telling the audience that they can rest easy because they are invited to live in South Africa if Trump does become president.Noah also pointed out that Trump retweeted a quote said by fascist Italian Dictator Benito Mussolini, which you can view below. @ilduce2016:  It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.    @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2016At first, Noah conceded that perhaps Trump didn t know that it was a Mussolini quote, but it soon became clear that Trump knows exactly who Mussolini is and proceeded to stand by the tweet during an interview with Chuck Todd on NBC. Trump even awkwardly paused after being asked if he wants to be associated with a fascist.Noah also noted that another trait of fascism includes a deep hatred of journalists, and then he played a clip of Trump vowing to make it possible to sue the media over negative stories about candidates, which Noah pointed out would mean he could be sued for informing everyone that  Donald Trump wants to bang his daughter. And then it was time to mention Trump s endorsement by KKK leader David Duke. After playing footage from Trump s interview with Jake Tapper on CNN in which he claimed to  not know anything about  Duke, Noah and the Daily Show team dug up a clip from 16 years ago of Trump calling Duke a bigot and racist that people don t want in their party. The irony is I think there s a lot of Republicans saying that now, too,  Noah concluded.Here s the video via Comedy Central.This was a brilliant segment by Noah and the Daily Show team, but they did miss a few traits. Fascists also disrespect women, and we all know Donald Trump has done that repeated during this campaign. Furthermore, fascists are obsessed with Christianity and corporate power. And Donald Trump isn t exactly the only Republican who flirts openly with fascism. It s basically part of the GOP s DNA at this point.To read more about fascism, click here.

Political candidates just do not accept endorsements from hate groups like the KKK. Such an endorsement is damaging and is usually quickly denounced to protect the image and reputation of the person running for public office.But Trump took a long time to finally disavow Duke, and it appears he only did so reluctantly.Kelly even reminded Huckabee of other racist incidents involving Trump, the most recent of which occurred when he decrided a judge for being Hispanic as the reason why a court ruled against him in a fraud case against Trump University.

You can often find the group posting things on Twitter and Facebook about how awesome and safe firearms are. They contribute millions and millions of dollars to Republican candidates to spread this wonderfully false message about their weapons of  freedom.  So, when a school shooting happened in Madison, Ohio on Monday we looked at their social networking accounts to see what the organization had to say about the incident and we found: Nothing.A 14-year-old boy walked into Madison Junior/Senior High School during lunch on Monday and opened fire with a .380 caliber semi-automatic handgun. Two boys, 14 and 15, were hit with freedom projectiles and two other students were injured during the panic that ensued after the shooting.One student, Shelby Kinnin, was sitting at the table next to where the shooting occurred and described what she saw: I heard the gunshot go off and then I saw one of the kids go down and grab their leg and fall. And then everybody running out of the building. I didn t know what it was at first, I thought maybe it was a chip bag, but then I thought that s too loud for a chip bag to pop. The shooter ran out of the school afterward and police used a K-9 to find him. He was arrested and charged with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of felonies assault, making terroristic threats and inducing panic.It s really not that surprising that the NRA is ignoring the latest in a long list of school shootings. For one thing, the police have not yet said how this kid got his hands on a gun, but he is 14-years-old. How many different ways can a child get a gun? He either took it from some Second Amendment, NRA-worshipping family member or he managed to buy it (not very likely) from someone who stole it from some other person who believes the only way to have freedom is to own penile extensions.Of course, they are going to keep quiet. They can t say anything without sounding like the imbeciles that they are. And if for some reason they do decide to address this, the statement will sound like, Well, this is why we shouldn t have gun free zones!  Because in the underdeveloped mind of an ammosexual MOAR GUNZ! is always the answer.Thankfully, no kids were killed this time, but these children will likely have emotional scars for the rest of their lives. And the shooter will likely spend a very long time in prison for something that could have been prevented if adults had acted responsibly.Watch: Featured image via video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Now, with Trump getting closer and closer to being the clear Republican nominee, these protests are becoming even more frequent. And Trump always makes sure any dissenting voice is removed, because god forbid anyone disagree with what he has to say.In an effort to remove these protesters as fast and as peacefully as possible, the Trump campaign has been playing this announcement before every event: This is a peaceful rally. In order to notify the law enforcement officers of the location of the protester, please hold a rally sign over your head and start chanting,  Trump. Trump. Trump.

Witnesses told Police that the men were screaming racial slurs, and one of them was waving a wallet with a Confederate flag on it, as they were attacking the teens and family.

There were no injuries, but this is the second attack that has happened by white supremacists in two days in California. In Anaheim one day earlier, a KKK rally turned into a street brawl that ended with a Klansman impaling 3 people with the tip of a flagpole.

Here s just a sample of how Rock blasted the lack of diversity at the ceremony: I m here at the Academy Awards, otherwise known as White People s Choice Awards. If they nominated hosts, I wouldn t even get this job. Y all would be watching Neil Patrick Harris right now. This year things are gonna be a little different at the Oscars. This year, the In Memoriam package is just gonna be Black people shot by the cops on their way to the movies. At the end of the awards ceremony, Rock closed the show with three important words:  Black Lives Matter.  And as expected, Chris  powerful human rights message was lost amongst racists, even those who work in the Hollywood industry. Hollywood producer Juergen Pichler Levine even had the audacity to say that the Oscars were too black! Levine posted (and then deleted) a meltdown that he shared with his 900,000 Instagram followers about the obscene number of black people at the Oscars. Levine said,  God bless America but not these monkeys  and complained about Obama.Levine wasn t the only one. Fox News had a field day when contributor Kevin Jackson ripped Rock over his remarks. When host Brian Kilmeade asked Jackson about what he thought about Rock s remarks, Jackson said: It was tragic. It was fun though watching a group of white racist liberals get put back on them the things that conservatives face every single day. At the end of the day, you can t say that Hollywood is racist because blacks have been getting awards in proportionate numbers for the last couple of decades. So at the same time I m watching these very sanctimonious liberals suffer, I also know that it s not good for the country that we go through this. Jackson also said that Rock was solely responsible for the  worst performance  the Oscars had seen in years. He argued: It was definitely one of the ones I wish I had a chance to miss. I think it was more just this idea how he was treating Hollywood of being so racist because black people hadn t been nominated. You can watch Jackson spit straight nonsense below:Even CNN s Carol Costello couldn t take the fact that racism still exists in America and watching it on television made it uncomfortable for her to sit smugly in her white privilege. Her reaction was,  Please stop and let me enjoy this for a moment. Guest commentator Michaela Angela David agreed and said that the hashtag  #OscarsSoAwkward  would have been more appropriate.

However, Scalia s sudden demise also had another unintended   and very unexpected   effect: it made notoriously silent Justice Clarence Thomas open his mouth for the first time in literally a decade.The case before the court involved the 1996 law that stopped domestic abusers from owning firearms again. Being the staunch conservative that he is, Thomas didn t agree with this, and seemed to imply that wife beaters should be able to own guns, despite the very good reasons for prohibiting them from doing so. So, Thomas s first utterance on the court in the last ten years was also incredibly stupid. He asked: Can you give me another example where a misdemeanor suspends a constitutional right permanently? There was an audible gasp of surprise from the court; after all, many folks there probably don t even know what Clarence s voice sounds like. But, now, we understand why he didn t speak. He s clearly a f*cking moron. As Winning Democrats reports, Thomas decided to go to bat for the gun rights of violent men and engaged in the following tit-for-tat with Ilana Eisenstein, a Justice Department attorney: You re saying that a misdemeanor conviction results in a lifelong ban on possessing a gun,  Thomas said.  Which at least right now is a constitutional right. In these cases, did any of the petitioners use a weapon? Eisenstein responded that they had not. So it is not directly related  to the original crime, Thomas asked.Well, it seems that with Scalia gone, Thomas will be the one to fight for the rights of abusers everywhere to go on and kill the partners they victimize.

Your mother was an alcoholic, is that true?JOHNSON-HUSTON: She had alcohol and drug issues, yes.O REILLY: OK. And drugs issues. Now, my point is: I feel terrible for you that you had to go through that, I really do. And I give literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to charities to help kids who are in your circumstance. You should know that.JOHNSON-HUSTON: Thank you and I appreciate it.O REILLY: But that s not society s fault that your mother was a drug addict and alcoholic and you didn t have a father. That s not my fault. But that was my point and it was clearly made.But while O Reilly loves to take the moral high ground when lecturing his guests and audience, at home there is reason to believe he is an unequivocal monster. The  angry  persona he plays for his Fox News crowd apparently doesn t go away when the cameras stop rolling. During the legal battle, all of O Reilly s skeletons came out of his closet and the picture was disturbing. In one example, leaked to the press, O Reilly s young daughter told a forensic examiner that she had watched O Reilly brutally assault her mom in a fit of rage.According to a source familiar with the facts of the case, a court-appointed forensic examiner testified at a closed hearing that O Reilly s daughter claimed to have witnessed her father dragging McPhilmy down a staircase by her neck, apparently unaware that the daughter was watching.Later, O Reilly attempted to destroy his ex-wife s reputation, going so far as to attempt to use his clout as a Republican celebrity to get her excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church.The New York appeals court seems to have taken this pattern of abuse into account when they issued their ruling:Viewing the totality of the circumstances, there is a sound and substantial basis for the Supreme Court s determination that it is in the best interests of the children for the mother to be awarded primary residential custody. Particularly relevant in this case are the clearly stated preferences of the children, especially considering their age and maturity, and the quality of the home environment provided by the mother.O Reilly denies any and all of the allegations levied against him, but even if only some of them were true, it s probably a very good thing that his children are allowed to stay away from his influence.Featured image via Fox News""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Still, Bill heard the army vet out, but unfortunately did not get the same respect when he tried to give him an answer. Bill said: You listen to me, as I ve heard you. I m not your commander-in-chief anymore, but if I were, I d tell you to be more polite. Bill tried to be cordial, but as the unconfirmed vet repeatedly demanded to know if Hillary had lied about the four American lives that were lost during the attack, Clinton lost his patience and said: If you shut up and listen to my answer, I ll answer it. His mind has been poisoned by lies, and he won t listen. Even as the marine was being escorted out of the audience by security, he continued to shout at Bill Clinton, which encouraged another audience member to harass Bill in his place. The second protester shouted over the crowd s  boos , She lied to those families. So all of those families are liars? Then the crowd came to Bill s defense, telling the protester  You re watching too many movies  as she was also escorted out of the event. Throughout the entire incident, the former president maintained his composure and remained calm while these two idiots tried to call his wife out and pathetically fail.After the protesters were gone, Bill defended Hillary and revealed that she lost many  personal friends  in the attack. He said, You can imagine how she feels when people make these charges. It s amazing that right-wingers just can t let Benghazi go.

I don t know anything about what you are even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don t know. I mean, did he endorse me or what s going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke, I know nothing about white supremacists. And so, you are asking me a question that I m supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about.

If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them, and certainly I would disavow if I thought that there was something wrong. You can t acknowledge off the top of your head that what the KKK stands for is horrifying?Well, the White House has now offered their response to Donald Trump s pathetic answers surrounding David Duke and the KKK. Press Secretary Josh Earnest, during a press conference on Monday, stated: I think my observation is simply that, you know Mr. Trump says that there s more that he needs to learn about Mr. Duke before he can render an opinion. But I think we now know all we need to know about Mr. Trump to render our personal opinion of his candidacy. Earnest, in so many words, just pretty much insinuated that most sane-minded people should be able to surmise that Donald Trump not only embraces his racist base of support, but is likely racist himself. Who the hell doesn t know what the KKK is and who David Duke is? Trump s playing dumb, because he knows most of his base is in full support of open racism. It s how Trump has run his campaign from the start.And yes, Earnest is correct, we no know all we need to know about Donald Trump to render our own personal opinions. If you re a Trump supporter at this point, you re likely racist. That s just a fact. If you re not, WTF are you doing?

Donald Trump can seem appealing until you take a closer look,  Oliver said.  Much like the lunch buffet at a strip club. Or the NFL. Or having a pet chimpanzee.

Her popularity and leadership in the Senate against corporate influences and Wall Street have made her a household name since President Barack Obama asked the former Harvard Law Professor to assist with Wall Street reform following the 2008 economic recession.After Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) resigned from her position as Vice Chair at the DNC in order to endorse Bernie Sanders, and after progressive champion Congressman Alan Grayson (D-FL) also endorsed Sanders today, the pressure is on for Senator Elizabeth Warren to either endorse a presidential candidate or not.Supporters of both Clinton and Sanders have speculated Senator Warren s neutrality is a sign of allegiance to their favored candidate. Warren s ideals more closely align with Senator Bernie Sanders, and the two are often seen in the Senate in tandem fighting against corporate greed. Just this past November, they were the only senators disputing Barack Obama s nominee to head the FDA over his ties to big pharmaceutical companies.Senator Warren has remained silent on the issue of an endorsement, but has remained as vocal as ever on the issues important to progressives. Today, an op-ed she wrote was published in the Boston Globe on how to level the playing field for working families in regards to the Family and Medical Leave Act. Both Sanders and Clinton support 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.Senator Warren s neutrality is most likely attributed to maintain the Democratic Party s integrity, as her endorsement would further divide a party already under pressure from the rift between Clinton and Sanders supporters. A Sanders endorsement would likely alienate Senator Warren from the Democratic Establishment, which has embraced her notoriety, and also embitter her supporters who preferred Clinton over Sanders.A Clinton endorsement would have similar consequences, but most likely negatively influence the Sanders campaign more than it would Clinton s campaign, as the failure of the Sanders campaign to receive an endorsement from arguably the most progressive in the Senate aside from Sanders would be a major setback. Senator Warren is also still a viable candidate for Vice President for either Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and regardless of who ultimately wins the nomination, Senator Warren will likely serve an important role if they win the presidency as she has in the Obama administration.If Senator Warren were to make an endorsement, the best time would be today or tomorrow, as Massachusetts, and her home state of Oklahoma hold their primaries on Super Tuesday tomorrow, and the longer she waits to make a decision, the less influence she would have on pushing for her choice as the nominee.

Things might get bad if his son offered to pay to ship black people out of the United States. In fact, such a move would be so monumentally stupid that  Oh! It happened, didn t it?On  Fox and Friends,  Donald Trump Jr. and brother Eric Trump showed up to discuss the  Super Tuesday  primaries and, of course, the  attacks  against The Donald for minor issues like wanting to shove all Muslims into concentration camps and ban them from entering the United States, as well as his support from white supremacist groups.Recently, Trump responded to an endorsement from former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke by adamantly refusing to denounce Duke   or any White Power Rangers who have stepped up to declare that he is the best thing to happen to this country since slavery. Trump, who regularly retweets white supremacists and their propaganda, is immensely popular among white nationalist groups, who actively use him as a recruitment tool and even call voters to encourage them to support the man they view as the new Fuhrer.

Trump Jr. added that criticism from minority groups is a positive as far as Trump is concerned, especially considering his base: Those are endorsements for Trump. That s the thing   when you have the establishment people in the debates, and they stack the debates with a thousand people that are all booing, those are votes for us.

She apparently buys into Trump s horrible ideas and rhetoric, though, as she defends him at every turn. Hell, she might be just as crazy as he is, as she even went so far as to appear on national television wearing a necklace made out of bullets in order to tout Trump s staunch support for the second amendment.However, it is about time someone took this black woman to task for her blind support of a clear racist, and, finally, CNN pundit and GOP strategist Tara Setmeyer did so. The pundit absolutely blasted Pierson, and said that she is simply  one of the blacks he likes since he pays her to clean up his mess everyday on television. When Setmeyer pointed out how Trump is under fire for refusing to firmly toss aside an endorsement from former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, Pierson dodged the question, saying: Mr. Trump said, look, I don t even know what you re talking about. So, I think this has really been blown out of proportion. And it really does highlight more media bias when no one has asked Barack Obama to disavow Sen. Robert Byrd, who was not just a klans [sic] member, but a leader in the Klan when he endorsed him in 2008. The thing is, though, Pierson, like so many ignorant Trump supporters, failed to notice the fact that Byrd had a BIG change of heart a hell of a long time ago, according to a book he wrote. So, completely different kettle of tripe entirely, as Duke is still very much an avowed racist.Setmeyer pushed Pierson, and plowed on: He brags about how he can manipulate folks. We sit and we watched this play out over the weekend, where Donald Trump took five different positions because he got pressured into having to actually admit to what was going on. David Duke absolutely came out and said it s against your heritage if you don t vote for Donald Trump, okay. That s an endorsement. Give me a break. And then to say, I couldn t hear what was going on, they gave me a [bad] earpiece. Anyone who watched the interview with Jake Tapper, Donald Trump clearly heard everything that Jake Tapper said. He responded to it. He didn t say,  Oh, I can t hear you, this isn t a good earpiece. Clearly getting angry, Pierson yelled at the hosts: The Democrats have called the Tea Party racists! Should we have him disavow the Tea Party too? Absolutely not! But Setmeyer, in the end got the best of Pierson, and called her out for what she is: We aren t even talking about Donald Trump s questionable history with race back to when the DOJ sued the Trump organization for racial discrimination. Or when Donald Trump came out and said how much he loves   quote    the blacks  or we can go down the list of very questionable things Donald Trump has said. But I don t know. Maybe Katrina Pierson is one of the blacks he likes since he pays her to clean up his mess everyday on television. And that s just it. Trump is fine with black folks, just since they bow, turn their backs on their own race, and go  YASSA MASSA!  when he comes running. They help assure the ignorant and blind people that he is somehow  not racist  no matter what he says.Of course, in the end, Pierson lamely went back to what Trump and all of his supporters say: He s winning. That s all that matters. He s winning.

Hispanic borrowers received only seven home loans, according to a recent study by the Greenlining Institute and Strategies Council.Big Banks have been ridiculed for racist lending practices since the 2008 economic recession partially caused by the collapse of the housing market. Countrywide Financial, a subsidiary of Bank of America, overcharged 200,000 African-Americans and Latinos for mortgages at the height of the housing boom. Bank of America settled with the Justice Department in 2011 to pay $335 million dollars in claims against the company. In those circumstances, discrimination was profitable,  wrote Jordan Weismann for the Atlantic in 2011.  Greed fueled a system that created a pattern of racial bias. Post 2008 economic recession, the racial bias in mortgage lending has gone from overcharging to turning down mortgage applications of African-Americans. Racial disparities were discovered across the state of California, as African-Americans make up just 2 percent of mortgage lending originations while consisting of 6.5 percent of the state s population. As the nation recovered from the recent economic crisis, the majority of Californians were locked out of the 2013 housing market missing the most affordable time to buy a home,  wrote the study authors.  44 percent of California s residents the combined African American and Hispanic populations obtained just 10.5 percent of total mortgage dollars lent by the top 12 lenders statewide. Sadly, these disparities were more pronounced in three cities where African Americans and Hispanics averaged 56 percent of the population. Racism in mortgage lending isn t a phenomenon unique to California, but rampant across the United States.In September 2015, Evans Bank settled a $825,000 lawsuit with New York State for racist lending practices. JP Morgan was sued by the City of Miami for discriminatory practices in 2014, along with Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America. PNC Bank was asked by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to pay $35 million in restitution for the discriminatory practices between 2002 and 2008 of a bank they bought, National City Bank.In the City of Denver, the National Fair Housing Alliance exposed racist practices by U.S. Bank in 2014. These are just a few examples of the banks who were caught conducting discriminatory practices as these trends remain persistent among the largest and smallest banks in the country, while minority communities continue to suffer from being denied the right to purchases a home, or the exorbitant extra fees they are charged because of their race.

For anti-American hardliners in Tehran, this was a very bad day. According to the Washington Post:Iranian reformists appear have won all 30 seats representing the nation s capital in parliament, a definitive rebuke to the hard-liners opposing President Hassan Rouhani s efforts to increase economic openness and cooperate with the West.In the first elections held since last year s nuclear deal, none of Iran s three main political camps   reformists, conservatives and hard-liners   is expected to win an outright majority, but early results indicate the best reformist showing in the 290-seat parliament in more than a decade.It was also a bad day for anti-Iranian hardliners in America. For months, Republican lawmakers have been attempting to destroy the merits of this international agreement under the premise that Iran will not abide by its agreed upon terms and that the country will never reform. Both theories have now been refuted. The United Nations recently announced that Iran had successfully fulfilled its obligations towards dismantling its nuclear program. Now even the government seems to be changing in a direction towards diplomacy and building international relationships.Iran seems on the verge of a monumental change, perhaps for the first time in decades. Years of threats from America moved the country very little, but the cooling tensions has allowed Iranian moderates to push for greater economic and social reforms.

At this point, the two countries merely talking to each other is a pretty huge deal.But no one outside of the Republican Party ever thought demanding immediate and unconditional surrender would ever work. Instead, Obama s strategy has always been to  trust, but verify  that the agreements he and Secretary of State John Kerry were hammering out were being fulfilled. The stakes are high: Greater prosperity for the Iranian public and a lesser chance of all out war between the United States and one of the biggest countries in the Middle East.None of this is likely to silence Obama s worst critics. They are beyond the point of rational thought about Iran. The results of this cognitive dissonance can occasionally be quite humorous. Just a day before Iranians went to the polls, and at the risk of looking like a complete jackass, conservative writer Eli Lake penned an anti-nuclear agreement rant for Bloomberg that predicted moderates would get demolished.

Cruz went fishing on this one, saying that Trump is not revealing his taxes because he s supposedly worth less than Mitt Romney s few hundred million. Then there s the money he allegedly gives to liberal groups. He then threw in the mob tie allegation. He said: Maybe he s not s rich as he says he is. Maybe Mitt Romney is richer than Donald Trump. He can answer that by releasing his taxes. On the other hand maybe it s the case that he s given large sums of money to liberal left wing groups like Planned Parenthood. You know, he praises Planned Parenthood in the debates over and over again. Maybe he s a big financial supporter of that. All of those questions Donald Trump can put to rest. You know Chuck, maybe it s the case, there have been multiple media reports about Donald Trump s business dealings with the mob, with the mafia. Maybe his taxes show those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported regardless what the bombshell is. Chuck Todd seemed startled by the claim and asked if Cruz had any evidence. Cruz said: ABC, CNN, multiple news reports have reported about his business dealings with for example S&A Construction, which was owned by Fat Tony Salerno who is a mobster who is in jail. It is owned by two of the major New York crime families and that has been reported in multiple media outlets.

She wrote: Here is the reality: our show was taken without comment or discussion or notice in the midst of an election season. After four years of building an audience, developing a brand, and developing trust with our viewers, we were effectively and utterly silenced. Now, MSNBC would like me to appear for four inconsequential hours to read news that they deem relevant without returning to our team any of the editorial control and authority that makes MHP Show distinctive. She left the window open, however, to MSNBC if they wanted to pull their heads out of their asses, that she may return.

Your campaign has been involved in a series of incidents that people are calling dirty tricks. In Iowa, the Cruz campaign sent out tweets saying Ben Carson was suspending his campaign. That was false. The campaign put out fliers accusing people of voting violations, that was false. In South Carolina, a Cruz super PAC attacked Trump over the Confederate flag.

Rather than explain himself and accept personal responsibility, Cruz flat out lied to Wallace and pretended his campaign has never done anything wrong. And then he complained about the line of questioning and claimed they were part of a Donald Trump-approved attack line.Ted Cruz definitely could have handled this better, but now all he has is egg on his face.Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The working class has been emboldened by the success of the Fight for $15 movement. They have successfully raised the minimum wage in cities and states all across the United States.The city of Birmingham raised their local minimum wage to $10.10 per hour last August. The wage increase was supposed to take place in July. That wage increase, however, will not be happening. That s because last Thursday, Alabama s Republican-controlled state government passed a bill to take away the city s power to raise their own minimum wage. The governor believes the minimum wage should be uniform across every area in Alabama,  spokeswoman Jennifer Ardis told the Associated Press.According to CBS News, Alabama s Senate passed the measure and the governor, Robert Bentley, signed the legislation an hour later. That means that workers in Alabama will still receive the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Alabama is one of only five states that does not have a minimum wage set higher than the federal minimum wage that employers can pay their workers.Birmingham City Council President Johnathan Austin said: Governor Bentley and the Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature dealt a severe blow to the working-class citizens of this state and in particular, the working poor in the City of Birmingham. Once again the GOP has stood with large corporations and the wealthy while telling the average working Alabamian that they re not important. This is a tactic that Republicans have been using to try and halt the progression of the new worker s rights movement that has risen up to demand fair wages. Alabama now joins sixteen other states who have passed laws that prevent cities from raising their minimum wage.It isn t surprising that Republicans are using this tactic. Initiatives to raise the minimum wage have been extremely effective at the local level of government. Huge cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles have successfully passed laws that raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour.You can watch a report on the story, below.

Trump s reasoning: he has to do research on them before rejecting their endorsement.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfBAKW54FVs]Trump s statement comes as the Anti-Defamation League called on him to reject endorsements from white supremacist groups.  CNN s Jake Tapper asked Trump if he was willing to disavow white supremacist endorsements. Here is part of the interview below. Trump said: I don t know anything about David Duke. I don t know anything about what you are even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don t know. I mean, did he endorse me or what s going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke, I know nothing about white supremacists. And so, you are asking me a question that I m supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. But Tapper wouldn t let him off the hook so quickly, and pressed on: Would you just say, unequivocally, you condemn them and you don t want their support? Trump said: Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don t know what group you re talking about. You wouldn t want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I d have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them, and certainly I would disavow if I thought that there was something wrong. The Ku Klux Klan,  Tapper interrupted. Trump replied: You may have some groups in there that are totally fine, and it would be very unfair. So, give me a list of groups and I ll let you know. Okay, I m just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here,  said Tapper. Honestly, I don t know David Duke,  Trump remarked.  I don t believe I ve ever met him. I m pretty sure I didn t meet him, and I just don t know anything about him. To claim ignorance is Trump s way of dodging the question. Trump knows that the majority of his supporters are racists and as is typical of a politician, you don t want to upset your supporters. Thus, he s remained hush hush on the overwhelming support he s received from racists around the country.Trump has succeeded in normalizing bigotry and hatred for minorities. It s going to be up to each of us, should he become the Republican nominee, to go out and vote against him in the general election.

The Governor is mistaken if he believes he can now count on my support, and I call on Christie s donors and supporters to reject the Governor and Donald Trump outright. I believe they will. For some of us, principle and country still matter. The move to endorse Trump was absolutely Christie s attempt to share the candidate s limelight. And even though the real estate mogul pretended to be really  honered that the NJ governor endorsed him, they way he spoke to Christie after his endorsement proves otherwise.It s also true that Christie has said that Trump is not fit to be President of the United States on more than one occasion. For instance on August 13, he told Fox News: Donald is a great guy and a good person, but I don t think he is suited to be president of the United States. I don t think his temperament is suited for that and I don t think his experience is. When Trump s celebrating 9/11 Muslim lie was all over the news, Christie called Trump a liar and said, But the facts are the facts, and that did not happen in New Jersey that day, and it hasn t happened since.

You know, the stuff you put on your pizza to give it a little (emphasis on  little ) zing? Two weeks of detention, a week of suspension, one month of community service or even the drastic step of expulsion would have been a more reasonable course of action. Instead, they got this not-at-all-extreme response:One Florida law the girls are facing charges under makes it illegal to add  poison, bacterium, radioactive material, virus, or chemical compound  to food or drinks, intending to kill or injure another person. It is a first-degree felony. The students also face a first-degree felony charge under Florida s Anti-Tampering Act,which prohibits changing consumer products  with reckless disregard  for another person s health and safety.Again, we re talking about RED PEPPER which, last I looked, was not capable of killing or injuring a person unless ingested by the pound (and maybe not even then).This growing trend of criminalizing children for behaving like children stems from our  War on Everything  mentality. We used to look at problem children and think  How can I help this kid grow into a productive adult?  Now, we look at these same kids and think,  Putting them in prison will be better for society.  That s not just cruel, it s certifiably insane. But we re still doing it. We ve flooded our schools with cops and cameras and metal detectors and random locker searches   all in the name of  safety. At best, we re conditioning children to accept a police state in which those in authority can violate their civil rights without consequence. At worst, we re conditioning them to think of themselves as criminals. This is especially true of the minority students that bear the brunt of  zero tolerance  policies and are the primary  beneficiaries  of the School-to-Prison pipeline. Funny how that worked out, right?How s that old saying go?  Get em while they re young and you ll have a customer for life?  It s nauseating that we ve applied that to mass incarceration.

Indian Point, a nuclear power plant that sits on the Hudson River, is experiencing a serious leak of radioactive material into the surrounding groundwater. Contamination levels have increased by 80 percent compared to previous samples taken, which is causing many experts to cite this as a disaster that is waiting to happen.Calls have been made for the plant to be shut down completely to avert an environmental cataclysm and public health hazard, due to the fact that the plant sits just 23 miles north of New York City and could also turn a major American river into radioactive soup.via inhabitat.comThe plant is leaking tritium, which is a radioactive form of hydrogen. Three of the 40 wells at the Indian Point plant showed an increase in radioactive material, as well as one well, in particular, showing a 65,000 percent increase. Not surprisingly, Entergy   the company that owns the plant, is claiming this is all totally safe and it will not harm local inhabitants  because the groundwater is located on their property.  I m no expert on groundwater, but I feel like Entergy doesn t understand how groundwater works. It doesn t respect property lines and will not necessarily stay  in its own yard,  as it were. Seriously, what are they getting at with this statement?John Kelly, former director of licensing for Indian Point, says that this is  more of a regulatory problem than environmental problem.  What exactly does this mean? How can you have a  regulatory  problem, without having an obvious environmental one to necessitate a new regulation being created? The only assertion you can draw from this statement is that Entergy knows their plant is a crisis waiting to happen, but there isn t a law to force them to fix it   so they simply do not care what happens.Governor Andrew Cuomo doesn t appear to be accepting the assertion that there is  nothing to see here,  and is pressing state officials to fully investigate Indian Point and employ  all available measures, including working with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to determine the extent of the release, its likely duration, cause, and potential impacts to the environment and public health. To say this could be monumental in scope is an understatement. Not only is New York City in the range of a potential disaster, but as the map above shows Connecticut and New Jersey are in range as well. The plant is directly in the center of one of the largest population concentrations in America where vital infrastructure hubs are located.

The poverty trends were compiled from U.S. Census data by University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers. Between 2009 and 2014, 13 percent of Wisconsin residents were living in poverty, the highest percentage since 1984. Scott Walker took office as Governor of Wisconsin on January 3, 2011.The researchers also analyzed a study by the Economic Innovation Group which found Milwaukee, the largest city in Wisconsin, is the seventh most economically distressed city in America, with 52 percent of the population under economic distress.The researchers also discovered poverty went up in both urban and rural areas of Wisconsin, and every educational background.According to the analysis,  for those with a high school education, poverty rose from 8.9 percent to 11 percent. It also rose from 6.6 percent to 8.9 percent among those who had attended  some college, and poverty also touched those with bachelor s degrees or more, rising from 3 percent to 3.6 percent. Child poverty also dramatically increased, as did the poverty gap between African-Americans and whites while the gap remained flat in most areas of the country during the same time period. The researchers cited the causes for increases in poverty as the broadening gap in wealth and income inequality, in which the highest income earners experience increases in wealth and income as wages for the working and middle classes remain virtually stagnant.The administration of Scott Walker certainly hasn t helped the residents of Wisconsin. Instead of creating jobs and improving wages for workers, Walker has led battles against workers rights, while providing tax breaks to the rich. Massive layoffs in the state have become a regular occurrence. Walker s,  Act 10  revoked collective bargaining rights for public employees to unionize, and cut their wages by ten percent. Walker has also signed several anti-union bills into law and increased subsidies for corporations while the state s minimum wage remains at the federal minimum of $7.25. The only people who have thrived in Wisconsin since Scott Walker assumed office is himself and the special interests who support him like the Koch Brothers.

Unfortunately, Fox has managed to condition its viewers to believe quite literally anything so well that they have hopped aboard the Trump Train to Stupidville   and that train has left the station without Fox.YouGov reports that, while Fox has been struggling to keep viewers for years, the network lost half of its audience in a single month. No, they didn t stop watching   after all, is there a news network that displays unabashed, willful stupidity with the degree of expertise Fox does?   but they hate it. Besides, Fox still has the  muted television in a doctor s office  and  sleeping grandmother  demographics locked.

It is about Mexico, it is about Mexican people.Biden explained to President Enrique Pe a Nieto that  it s a heated campaign season,  and that Republicans are willing to say pretty much anything to be declared King or Queen of Stupid Mountain as they vie for the GOP nomination. The words of Trump or any of his colleagues, the Vice President said, is the antithesis of how most Americans feel: It s a heated campaign season and I just want you to know, Mr. President, that the most heated rhetoric you ve heard from competitors for the nomination for president is not who we are as the American people. It is not the view that is the view of the majority of the American people. It s the exact opposite. It s the opposite view. The GOP s rhetoric toward Hispanics has been rather hateful, but Donald Trump has attracted the most scrutiny with his assertion that the Mexican Government sends people to the United States   people who, according to the billionaire bankruptcy expert, are all rapists, drug dealers, and murderers. In fact, he plans to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, because Trump is apparently too stupid to realize that tunnels are a thing.Trump s hate is so pervasive that two former Mexican Presidents have recently spoken up in opposition to the horrible rhetoric spouted at any of his rallies. In early February, Felipe Calderon informed Trump that it is extremely unlikely that his country would build his signature campaign promise: We are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall!

That rush of warm air you feel on your face? It s the wave of radiation from the Republican Party s nuclear meltdown. We re witnessing the death of a major political party.Things are getting truly desperate in conservative camps and the grim acceptance that this isn t a bad dream and that Trump is almost surely going to win the nomination has begun to set in. It s led to an odd plan. In a stunning report by the New York Times, Republican sources confirm that party leadership is planning to destroy Trump and give Hillary Clinton the win rather than let him have control of the GOP.To rally depressed Republicans, McConnell has hatched an unthinkable tactical retreat: Let Hillary Clinton win and focus on maintaining control over the Senate.While still hopeful that Mr. Rubio might prevail, Mr. McConnell has begun preparing senators for the prospect of a Trump nomination, assuring them that, if it threatened to harm them in the general election, they could run negative ads about Mr. Trump to create space between him and Republican senators seeking re-election. Mr. McConnell has raised the possibility of treating Mr. Trump s loss as a given and describing a Republican Senate to voters as a necessary check on a President Hillary Clinton, according to senators at the lunches.Did you catch that? Mitch McConnell floated the idea of tanking his party s own candidate for president over sandwiches at lunch.McConnell s thinking is this: If Republicans accept that Trump will never win the general election, they can devote their energy towards running against Clinton at the senate level. If that sounds insane, then welcome to the Republican Party in 2016.The saddest part in this scheme is that McConnell s plan probably won t even work   at least not in the way he hopes. For one thing, Trump has run his entire campaign on being anti-everything the current  establishment  Republican Party stands for. If his rabid supporters catch wind of the fact that loathed senators like Mitch McConnell are lining against him, that will only make him more popular. Trump s been saying the party is against him all along. This only confirms it.Making matters even more dire, McConnell s tenure as Senate Leader has been defined by such egregious levels of obstructionism that Republican lawmakers are roughly as popular as athlete s foot. In just the last few weeks, sources leaked McConnell s plan to literally do nothing during this year s legislative session. If that  do nothing  strategy is shameful, he only made it worse by following it up with the announcement that he would be blocking President Obama s Supreme Court Justice nominee to score political points. Neither decision was popular with Democrats or Republicans.As a result, polls suggest McConnell is leading Senate Republicans into an epic defeat on election day. Having destroyed Trump to save the jobs of Senate Republicans, he will be left with nothing to show for it.

Trump s skewed logic was the agency s $8 billion budget is wasted and should be reallocated to the states.In response to Rubio s pressing of Trump for what his plan is to cut taxes and balance the federal budget, Trump replied: Environmental protection   we waste all of this money. We re going to bring that back to the states. We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget and we will be dynamic again. The radical proposal of Trump defies anything remotely close to being realistic. Trump has also accused the EPA of creating more damage than they protect and making it impossible for the country to compete. His rhetoric is part of the mode of thinking many of his supporters have, that the government somehow is impeding their ability to improve their lives, and the solution is de-regulating everything in order for a free market of competition will solve everything. In reality, dissolving the EPA, which would involve repealing many environmental laws, would leave environmental protection up to the states, where most do not have the resources to enforce meaningful environmental regulations. This would also cause a vacuum of competition where states would try to appeal to hazardous industries to come to their state by downgrading environmental regulations.Because the entire Republican Party has lost their minds, Trump s proposal is one that has also been adopted by Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz. This past January, Rubio dubbed the EPA, the  Employment Prevention Agency,  adding the agency s regulations are out of control and hurt our economy.Cruz, who already is notorious for wanting to repeal all federal climate change regulation and the Clean Air Act, told Breitbart News in 2015,  I think states should press back using every tool they have available. We ve got to rein in a lawless executive that is abusing its power,  in response to a question as to whether states should comply with EPA coal regulations.The proposal to get rid of the EPA would be disastrous for the environment and the daily lives of every American. The endemic species throughout this country and the ecosystems they inhabit are already under insurmountable stress, and the science overwhelmingly shows environmental regulations, caps, and oversight are needed to mitigate the effects of climate change and other environmental influences.Dissolving the EPA is just one of the many dangers the Republican presidential candidates pose to the American public if elected, and if they were ever successful in doing so, the damage incurred could potentially destroy parts of the country indefinitely with hazardous sites, toxic waste pollution, and increasing emission rates becoming more of the norm. If anything, the EPA s funding needs to be increased, and the agency improved by making it more effective, because the stakes couldn t be higher. America cannot afford a president who doesn t understand action needs to be made to combat climate change, not worsen it.Featured image via Screen Capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It is a window into hell.The video was released via Trump s Facebook page and Twitter account on Friday night, and for those hoping for a little more policy detail from Trump, we got it. Sadly, it is a little worse than we imagined.What would Trump do on his first day, he would rescind every single Executive Order made by President Obama. Why? Because he doesn t have to go through Congress.This would mean:Trump took primary aim however, at gun control and immigration. Trump would revoke the new gun control laws put in place in response to Sandy Hook and the mass shooting epidemic. He would also remove the protections Obama put in place for the children of undocumented immigrants that would prevent them being deported. These are people who have been born, or raised for the majority of their lives, in the United States. But Trump wants these protections removed so he can fulfill on his plans for the forced mass deportation of undocumented migrants and any children living in the United States.He says: I would get rid of the attack on our Second Amendment, because that s what Obama is doing when he does that.I would very, very strongly get rid of the attack on the border. We have a border that s like a piece of Swiss Cheese. People are pouring through. That order will be the single first thing I do.And we will work on all of these Executive Orders, and the bad ones, of which mostly that s what you have, will be terminated immediately my first day in office. Never mind that the man can t construct a simple sentence without turning it into word soup. This is what a Trump White House will look like: It would a more cruel, more authoritarian, less safe America.

In fact, most of us don t even want to think about what it would be like.Bill Maher gave us an awful dose of reality on Real Time last night, when he imagined what a State of the Union address from the current Republican presidential front runner might look like. The enactment was prefaced with Maher pointing out the irony of Trump s complaints that former Mexican President Vicente Fox had used foul language to fire back at him after he pledged to make Mexico pay for the construction of his beloved U.S.-Mexico border wall if he became president. Fox s amazing response to that was  I m not going to pay for the f*cking wall  and he refused to comply when Trump demanded an apology for the comment.Amused with Trump s complete lack of self-awareness, Maher quipped on his show: Donald Trump must admit that, of all his reversals, hypocrisies, and 180s, his condemnation this week of Vicente Fox for using foul language is the most ridiculous of all. Talk about the pot calling the kettle orange. As Maher rolls footage of the Republican front runner cursing in several public speeches, the fact that Trump is pretending to be offended by Fox becomes even more hilarious.Maher then moved on to tackle Trump s disturbing popularity with the use of his alias,  Andrew Dice Trump . Maher commented that the reason Trump had risen so high was because voters like his crass way of speaking. Maher remarked, They kind of like it when a politician drops the facade and talks the way we all really talk. And to explore just what a future Trump presidency might look like, Maher acted out a State of The Union address to show just how political discourse could go if America doesn t wake up soon and realize that we re better than bigotry and outlandish comments. Assuming the position of Trump in the scene, Maher cursed his entire way through the distasteful address and announced that  the state of our union is f*cking awesome. Sadly, Maher captured Trump perfectly and this is probably a very realistic representation of what a speech by President Trump might look like.

The brave protester stood up and stuck his tongue out at Trump, proudly displaying the fact that he was wearing a homemade shirt that said  KKK endorses Trump. As Trump s devout minions noticed the protester s shirt, the audience was overcome with boos and shouting. Trump walked over to the protester, practically stared the man down, then paced the stage while he waited for his security to take the protester away. Meanwhile, Trump s fans chanted  USA, USA, USA . Once the man was gone, Trump took center stage once again and went on a rant against political correctness, saying it was to blame for the slow response to the protester. You see, in the good old days, law enforcement acted a lot quicker than this! A lot quicker. In the good old days, they d rip him out of that seat so fast, but today everyone is politically correct. Our country is going to hell for being politically correct. Going to hell. You can watch the confrontation below:Considering that earlier this week, Trump faced another protester and threatened to  punch him in the face , this response from Trump was mild.Although Trump removed the protester, the man had hit on a part of Trump s campaign that the GOPer is now trying to distance himself from. Just hours before this confrontation, Trump had brushed off the support of former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, who d said not voting for Trump would be against Americans   heritage.  Before quickly changing the subject, the front runner said, David Duke endorsed me? OK, alright. I disavow, OK? While Trump may be trying to pretend that he s not a racist, it doesn t reverse the fact that Trump has retweeted various white supremacists and is a favorite candidate amongst the most racist people in our country.

In fact, they are so afraid of the possibility of a split or liberal Supreme Court that they have settled their lawsuit for almost a billion dollars.Dow Chemical was set to go in front of the SCOTUS after a 2013 ruling by a Kansas court upheld a massive $1.06 billion judgement against the company for price-fixing. The company sued and found liable after being accused of colluding with four other chemical companies (Bayer AG, BASF SE, Huntsman International LLC and Lyondell Chemical Co.) to fix the prices of polyether polyol products   which are used to make urethane foam   in order to overcharge customers in the  90s and early 2000s.The company was counting on Scalia to rule in their favor and overturn the huge judgement, but then he died. His death meant that one of two things would happen 1.) they d go in front of 8 justices and get a split decision which would uphold the $1.06 billion ruling, or 2.) they would face a liberal court if Obama gets someone on the court and the judgement would also be upheld. When they realized that they were screwed they issued a statement announcing they d settled and blamed it on Scalia s death:The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE: DOW) has entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the In re Urethanes Class Action litigation. In this settlement agreement, Dow has agreed to pay the plaintiff class $835 million Growing political uncertainties due to recent events within the Supreme Court and increased likelihood for unfavorable outcomes for business involved in class action suits have changed Dow s risk assessment of the situation. Dow believes this settlement is the right decision for the company and our shareholders.Translation: Scalia died and f*cked us over, so now we are being forced to pay $835 million to all of the people we hurt.Scalia s death didn t just hurt Dow though, there are a number of other huge corporations set to go in front of the court, including Microsoft and Tyson Foods.What s actually really infuriating about this is that Dow was so sure that they were going to win this case until Scalia croaked. This guy was such a corporate shill (as are the rest of the conservative members) that big companies who had judgements levied against them were happy to go in front of the court because they knew they d win.So, while this sudden settlement may be hilarious, it is also pretty damning. It really highlights how much the conservative Supreme Court has hurt average Americans in order to help big business.Featured image via Wikipedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The shooters, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, committed suicide. At the time it was the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, but then the shooting at Newtown happened.In her moving piece, Klebold discusses the role of mental health in mass shootings, and notes that over the years since the massacre, we as a society have learned to better see the signs of mental distress and to know better how to reach out to kids in crisis.But she also notes that as important as that is, the issue of easy access to guns is still hanging over this issue.Having said that, I still cannot help but believe that Dylan and Eric would not have been able to take the lives of so many if they had not had such easy access to guns. As I later learned, Dylan and Eric   both of whom were minors   secretly attended a gun show where they bought the shotguns they would use in the massacre and met a young man who sold them a TEC-9 semiautomatic pistol.Is our right to gun ownership under the Second Amendment so absolute that we cannot, at the very least, restrict access to certain kinds of weapons to protect the most vulnerable among us   especially teenagers, whose judgment at the best of times is compromised by hormones, impulsivity and immature decision-making? Is our right to bear arms so vital to what it means to be an American that there can be no limit on those rights whatsoever, whether raising the legal age at which one can purchase a gun, as we did with the drinking age or conducting more extensive background checks or restricting access to assault weapons designed for the battlefield?Her words strike right at the heart of the core beliefs of the NRA, who insist nothing can ever actually be done to rein in guns in America.

Things have gotten so bad for them in the face of Trump s virtually unstoppable campaign, that they are now throwing money at a GOP consulting firm to figure out if a late-term independent 3rd party run could be initiated if Trump wins the Republican nomination.The document, which was supposed to remain confidential, was created by staff at Data Targeting, which is a right-wing political firm in Gainesville Florida. The memo says that it is possible to mount an independent candidacy but [it] will require immediate action on the part of this core of key funding and strategic players. All this research has to happen before March 16, when inevitably Trump is the nominee, so that we have a plan in place,  an inside source that was part of the development of the document said. March 16 is the day after the Republican primary in Florida, which is winner-take-all for the victor. Marco Rubio supporters are hoping that they can win this one to halt Trump s so far unstoppable momentum. As it is now, Rubio s prospects for this are growing dimmer by the day. The latest Real Clear Politics poll shows Trump at 40.3 to Rubio s 20.8. It will be almost impossible for Rubio to beat Trump in his home state at this rate.The process of creating a third-party  independent  to run is not going to be easy. The candidate would need to gather over 79,900 petition signatures in Texas by May 9, and 89,000 in North Carolina by June 9. While this is possible in the time allotted, finding some relative unknown and suddenly propping him or her up as the great white hope of the Republican party will be met with jeers by many. As dumb as Republican voters may be, they aren t going to suddenly start voting for a corporate funded nobody.Texas and North Carolina have been pegged as the litmus test due to Texas s 38 electoral votes being a necessity for any Republican win, and North Carolina s status as a swing state that leans Republican. A failure in these states for a third-party candidate would make it nearly impossible for a 3rd party win.It s possible that the third-party candidate could still run, in an effort to simply prevent a Trump presidency at the cost of letting the Democrats retain control. A Trump nomination is going to be embarrassing enough for Republicans. An actual Trump presidency would possibly damage the party permanently beyond repair. It s only a theory, but if it came down to destroying the party or waiting at least 4 more years, they will take the latter.Featured image via YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

CEO Paal Kibsgaard saw his company profits decrease 40 percent since the downward trend in oil prices began, and as a result he fired 25,000 people in 2015, roughly 20 percent of the company s workforce.The CEO felt the pain in his company s loss of profits though as his salary decreased from $18.5 million in 2014 to $18.3 million in 2015. The drop was only due to the performance in his pension plan though, as his base salary  and stock values increased from 2014.Despite running a failing company, Kibsgaard remains one of the highest paid CEOs in the World. In 2014, CNN Money ranked him as number 9 on their list of the 12 highest paid CEOs in the World.Forbes listed Schlumberger as #123 on its list of largest public companies, with a market cap of $109.8 billion as of May 2015. The sheer size, scope and profits the company makes should inoculate it to some degree from making enormous employee layoffs, leaving thousands of men and women with families unemployed, facing inadequate compensation and the stressors inherent with re-entering the job market. Layoffs are often a sign of failure by top executives to properly manage a business and forecast needs,  wrote Eleanor Boxham in a 2013 Fortune magazine article.  And failure of board members to ensure that the right management is in place. Given this sign of failure from Schlumberger s CEO, it is ethically abhorrent he receives such a high salary the same year the company lays off thousands of lower level employees. Despite the layoffs, the company s stock has steadily increased lately, and unfortunately that is all these corporate leaders, especially in the oil industry, care about. These attitudes are what contribute to the growing income and wealthy inequality not just in America, but all over the World. The 62 wealthiest people in the world have as much wealth as the bottom 50 percent of the world, nearly 3.6 billion people. The wealthiest 1 percent of the World s population have as much wealth as the other 99 percent. For nearly fifty years, wages of working people in the United States have remained stagnant while the top income earners have seen their salaries grow exponentially. In the United States since the 2008 recession, nearly 99 percent of all new generated income has gone to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. Current trends suggest these enormous disparities in wealth are expanding, and if CEOs like Kibsgaard are allowed to take home huge salaries while simultaneously firing thousands of people, things are only going to get worse.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And if you watch daily, you may have noticed this slow shift over the past year or so. Sure, there s still shows like Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes  All In, but all in all, if you re looking for real progressive TV, you re going to have to find it somewhere on the internet. The network is making a strong effort to switch from opinion to hard news, and that s why you re seeing fewer and fewer opinion shows and more generic broadcasts, especially during the day.Unfortunately, it looks like Melissa Harris-Perry was being forced to silence her voice by the network as well, and as of Friday, Harris-Perry has decided that she will no longer do her weekend show.In a letter written by Harris-Perry, and put out by one of her original producers, Jamil Smith, she explains in great detail why she has made this decision.Here s the letter in full:Dearest Nerds,As you know by now, my name appears on the weekend schedule for MSNBC programming from South Carolina this Saturday and Sunday. I appreciate that many of you responded to this development with relief and enthusiasm. To know that you have missed working with me even a fraction of how much I ve missed working with all of you is deeply moving. However, as of this morning, I do not have any intention of hosting this weekend. Because this is a decision that affects all of you, I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning.Some unknown decision-maker, presumably Andy Lack or Phil Griffin, has added my name to this spreadsheet, but nothing has changed in the posture of the MSNBC leadership team toward me or toward our show. Putting me on air seems to be a decision being made solely to save face because there is a growing chorus of questions from our viewers about my notable absence from MSNBC coverage. Social media has noted the dramatic change in editorial tone and racial composition of MSNBC s on-air coverage. In addition, Dylan Byers of CNN has made repeated inquiries with MSNBC s leadership and with me about the show and what appears to be its cancellation. I have not responded to reporters or social media inquiries. However, I am not willing to appear on air in order to quell concerns about the disappearance of our show and our voice.Here is the reality: our show was taken without comment or discussion or notice in the midst of an election season. After four years of building an audience, developing a brand, and developing trust with our viewers, we were effectively and utterly silenced. Now, MSNBC would like me to appear for four inconsequential hours to read news that they deem relevant without returning to our team any of the editorial control and authority that makes MHP Show distinctive.The purpose of this decision seems to be to provide cover for MSNBC, not to provide voice for MHP Show. I will not be used as a tool for their purposes. I am not a token, mammy, or little brown bobble head. I am not owned by Lack, Griffin, or MSNBC. I love our show. I want it back. I have wept more tears than I can count and I find this deeply painful, but I don t want back on air at any cost. I am only willing to return when that return happens under certain terms.Undoubtedly, television nurtures the egos of those of us who find ourselves in front of bright lights and big cameras. I am sure ego is informing my own pain in this moment, but there is a level of professional decency, respect, and communication that has been denied this show for years. And the utter insulting absurdity of the past few weeks exceeds anything I can countenance.I have stayed in the same hotels where MSNBC has been broadcasting in Iowa, in New Hampshire, and in South Carolina, yet I have been shut out from coverage. I have a PhD in political science and have taught American voting and elections at some of the nation s top universities for nearly two decades, yet I have been deemed less worthy to weigh in than relative novices and certified liars. I have hosted a weekly program on this network for four years and contributed to election coverage on this network for nearly eight years, but no one on the third floor has even returned an email, called me, or initiated or responded to any communication of any kind from me for nearly a month. It is profoundly hurtful to realize that I work for people who find my considerable expertise and editorial judgment valueless to the coverage they are creating.While MSNBC may believe that I am worthless, I know better. I know who I am. I know why MHP Show is unique and valuable. I will not sell short myself or this show. I am not hungry for empty airtime. I care only about substantive, meaningful, and autonomous work. When we can do that, I will return not a moment earlier. I am deeply sorry for the ways that this decision makes life harder for all of you. You mean more to me than you can imagine.Yours always,MelissaIt s really a shame that MSNBC is trying to silence the liberal voice. A voice that is being drowned out endlessly as more and more news outlets are acquired by right-leaning companies and CEOs. It s as though MSNBC gave up on itself, and instead of work on a formula that could really bring in more views, decided it was easier to just be generic. Hopefully the network comes to their senses sooner rather than later, and hopefully we will hear Harris-Perry s very well-educated, and much-needed voice once again. However, we must respect her decision.Featured image: RCP""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It doesn t matter if he changes his tune five minutes later, his opinions sway with whatever is most opportunistic for him at any given time.Take, for instance, his tax returns that Mitt Romney and several others are calling for. Now, during the latest GOP debate he said he can t show his returns because they are currently being audited, and he cited that s what happens with most large businesses and business owners, so for that reason he can t show his returns yet until the audit is over. Then after the debate, during an interview with CNN s Chris Cuomo, Trump claimed he was likely being audited and unfairly treated by the IRS because he s a Christian. So, in the matter of about an hour, he tried pandering to business owners and then later to Christians. After all, several supposed Christians feel as though they are being persecuted for not being allowed to legally discriminate any longer, and Trump knowing this selling line is already out there, uses it for his own purposes as well. He s not dumb   but he clearly thinks those who like him are. After all,  he loves the poorly educated. Cuomo, however, had to do his best to hold it together while Trump was trying to claim he was being audited based on his Christianity. Trump said: I m always audited by the IRS, which I think is very unfair. I don t know whether it s maybe because of religion or because of something else, maybe because I m doing this [running for office]. When Cuomo asked Trump to further explain what he meant by  religion,  Trump said: Well, maybe because of the fact that I m a strong Christian and I feel strongly about it, so maybe there s a bias. This is when you can clearly see Cuomo raise his eyebrows and hold his face together as best he can not to just laugh in Trump s face. Trump continued: You have many religious groups that are complaining about that. They ve been complaining about it for a long time. So wait, now Trump is a  religious group ?? Umm Trump is clearly trying to dodge the need to release his returns, and he s trying as many lines as possible to see what sticks so he won t have to release them.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""On February 25, 1994, Israeli-Zionist terrorist Barch Goldstein walked into the Ibrahimi Mosque in the Palestinian city of Khalil (Hebron) and executed 29 kneeling Palestinian worshipers and wounded another 129. Soon after, protests broke out in the city and at least 20 more Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers guarding the illegal Jewish settlers Israel implanted in the city. Israel also imposed a permanent closure on Al-Shuhada Street, once a bustling strip of Palestinian businesses. The street is the main road leading to the Tomb of the Patriarchs and today, only Jewish Israelis are allowed access to the street, turning the area, which was once the heart of the city, into a virtual ghost town.As Palestinians mark 22 years since the massacre at the mosque and the closure of Al-Shuhada Street, Amnesty International is calling on Israel to lift their military restrictions and collective punishment of Palestinians, a war crime under international law: Since October 2015, as violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) and Israel has surged, the Israeli authorities have drastically increased the arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions on movement imposed on Palestinians in and around Hebron s Old City, declaring parts of it a  closed military zone.  This has further entrenched and exacerbated a pattern of long-standing violations of the rights to freedom of movement, work, health and education of Palestinians in Hebron, especially tens of thousands residing or working in or near the Old City. The arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions, which are not applied to the Israeli Jews living in the illegal settlements in and around the city, constitute collective punishment and violate international humanitarian law. Furthermore, Palestinian and international human rights defenders, including monitors, have been prevented from accessing the areas of al-Shuhada Street and el Rumeida, and are constantly harassed by Israeli forces and settlers. In typical fashion of tyrannical states, Israel has also attacked human rights activists who have protested Israel s brutal policies toward the Palestinians. Amnesty International states: International activists and human rights defenders, who have played a crucial role for many years in documenting Israeli violations against Palestinians living in Hebron, have also been harassed and attacked by Israeli forces and settlers, and prevented from entering the area designated a closed military zone. Activists from the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) told Amnesty International in October that Israeli settlers had physically attacked them frequently, including in the presence of Israeli forces, who did not act to stop the attacks. The ISM also reported that the Israeli police arrested two international activists on 3 November 2015 at the request of Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint the two activists were observing. The two were released, ISM said, when they agreed to leave the city for a week despite the Israeli police telling them there was  no evidence  against them. The report ends by pointing to Israel s colonies or what are typically referred to as settlements, which are illegal under international law, as the main source of tension in the area. Israel has built colonies and an infrastructure exclusively for Jews, stealing Palestinian land and then killing them when they resist Israel s Orwellian experiment. Amnesty International states:  The presence of illegal settlements in and around Hebron is both the cause of the long-standing human rights crisis in the city, and the primary reason for the escalating violence seen there in recent months.

The easiest answer for the future generations is to keep it in the ground. And we are thankful for Bernie Sanders for saying  Let s #keepitintheground.  Don t make a mess we can t clean up, LaDuke said.Here is the video:https://www.facebook.com/MidwestForBernie/videos/343098512481172/?fref=nfFor those not familiar with LaDuke s history, she is an indigenous American who has worked tirelessly fighting for tribal rights and sustainable development. Winona LaDuke is an Anishinaabekwe (Ojibwe) enrolled member of the Mississippi Band Anishinaabeg. After graduating from Harvard, LaDuke has spent her career writing about issues that hurt indigenous groups and the environment. LaDuke currently works as the Director of Honor the Earth.It is not surprising that LaDuke has decided to endorse Sanders for president. Sanders has an ambitious plan to completely transform the United States energy infrastructure. What s really great about Sanders   keep it in the ground  strategy, is that so much of it can be accomplished without the approval of Congress.The president of the United States has the authority to prevent the State Department from granting leases to fossil fuel companies if they want to extract dirty fuels from federal land. President Obama recently used this power to put a quasi-moratorium on leases for coal mines. As president, Sanders would also be able to not give leases to companies who wish to build pipelines across international borders.One aspect of Sanders  energy plan should be of particular interest to both racial justice groups, environmentalists, and those who work in their intersection. Sanders recognizes the disparity of the impact fossil fuel extraction and usage has on indigenous peoples and communities of color. That s why he supports legislation that would work to halt the devastation fossil fuels are causing while creating millions of new jobs. Sanders co-sponsored the  Keep It in the Ground Act  last year. When he did he released a video explain why we need to transform our nation s energy system.You can watch the video below.

And on CNN this morning, the girls didn t disappoint. Their interview was only a few minutes long, but they managed to cause more than enough trouble.TwitterCommenting on last night s GOP debate, host Carol Costello asked Trump s biggest fans what they thought about presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz joining alliances and shaking each other s hands behind Trump s back, in a joint effort to bring the front runner down. The Trump-loving sisters  response left Costello absolutely stunned as the girls suggested that Rubio was probably gay at one point in his life, if not now. Hardaway said: I think that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, they re both snakes.When I look at Marco Rubio, Marco Rubio told us to Google Donald Trump, but I did one better: I Googled him and when I Googled him, you know, he owes America and the gay community an apology.It sounds like he may have had a gay lifestyle in his past! Completely shocked and taken back by the comment, Costella gasped,  What?  and pleaded with the girls not to go down that road. No, Lynette  Lynette. But Richardson backed Hardaway up, and said: That s what s on Google. So you have to be cautious when you start telling people to google people   stuff will come up. We don t know if it s true, so we ll say  allegedly,  but he shouldn t have told people to google Donald, because I googled him and that came up. Costella, likely aware that there would be backlash from the Rubio campaign, steered the girls off into another subject, which happened to be Trump s habitual blaming of immigrants for taking American jobs, while he himself employed many immigrants at his hotels. Following in the footsteps of their beloved presidential candidate, both Hardaway and Richardson were absolutely fine with that.You can watch the segment below, courtesy of Mediaite: Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""A male Idaho Republican with five daughters made some creepy and outrageous claims during a hearing on an abortion bill on Thursday.According to The Spokesman-Review, the bill  would require women seeking abortions to be given a list of providers of free ultrasounds, and to be told they have a right to such a procedure and to hear a fetal heart monitor  and does not include exceptions for rape and incest victims.During the hearing, a crisis pregnancy center employee was testifying when GOP state Rep. Pete Nielsen made cringe-worthy remarks reminiscent of former Missouri Rep. Todd Akin, who in 2012 claimed that women have natural defenses to shut down the reproductive process if she is going through a  legitimate rape. Now, I m of the understanding that in many cases of rape it does not involve any pregnancy because of the trauma of the incident,  Nielsen said when the CPC employee claimed that her organization had already persuaded two rape victims against having an abortion.  That may be true with incest a little bit,  Nielsen continued.Here s audio of Nielsen s remarks via YouTube.After the hearing, Nielsen doubled down on his remarks, claiming that pregnancy  doesn t happen as often as it does with consensual sex, because of the trauma involved. In fact, a study conducted in 1996 found that around 32,000 rapes result in pregnancy every year.The Spokesman-Review also did some digging and reported,The scientific consensus on the issue is that rape is as likely to result in pregnancy as consensual sex, and some studies suggest the rate of pregnancy is higher in rape. A 2003 study that appeared in the scientific journal  Human Nature,  for instance, found that the rate of pregnancy from rape exceeded the rate of pregnancy from consensual sex by a  sizable margin. But Nielsen, who is NOT a doctor, said  That s information that I ve had through the years,  and then admitted,  Whether it s totally accurate or not, I don t know. In other words, Nielsen has no clue what he is talking about, but decided to make the remarks anyway.Women do not have a natural ability to halt the reproductive process any more than men do. All it takes is one sperm to reach and join a woman s egg to result in a pregnancy. The reproductive process makes no distinction between consensual and non-consensual sex.But Nielsen couldn t stop talking and made a really creepy remark about why he believes rape and incest don t cause pregnancy. I read a lot of information. I have read it several times.   Being a father of five girls, I ve explored this a lot. Yeah, he really said that.Planned Parenthood in Idaho legislative director Hannah Brass Greer expressed outrage that Nielsen, or any lawmaker for that matter, could make such a claim. That s obviously, medically, scientifically inaccurate,  she said.  That type of comment we ve heard before, when politics get in the way of medical care. It s harmful on so many levels. Indeed, not only are such remarks harmful to women and science, it s proven to be especially harmful to Republicans during an election year. As you ll recall, Todd Akin went on to lose his Senate race to Claire McCaskill. Other Republicans who spoke about rape such as Richard Mourdock in Indiana also lost their bid for public office. Republicans also lost in the presidential race that same year because they couldn t stop talking about rape, which caused women to flock to the Democratic Party.It is an issue that has absolutely shredded Republicans in recent years, so it will interesting to see how Republicans, especially those who are running for president in 2016, respond if they are asked to comment on Nielsen s remarks. And if anything, it demonstrates that Republicans still have not learned to keep their mouths shut and that they still hold inaccurate beliefs about rape and the female reproductive system.Featured Image via Raw Story""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""In light of the Flint water crisis, Michigan Republicans are publicly and privately acknowledging that their party s approach to governing has been a total disaster.As Michigan s Eclectablog reports here,  despite the shiny, happy face that Gov. Snyder is putting on and despite his continuing calls for more privatization and the success of Emergency Management,  off the record, state Republicans have been quietly admitting that the GOP s plan to run government like a business  has been an utter failure. John Lindstrom, of Michigan s Gongwer News Service, detailed a string of off-the-record interviews with the state s Republican leadership here.As reported by Gongwer, All of them recognized Flint as a failure, a spectacular failure, of state government. They also worried that it was particularly a failure of their party, as they almost universally said:  Our guys. No matter the setting, or the day, or the circumstance of the conversations, or who was speaking (and not everyone speaking would have known each other), there was an almost stunning repetition to each conversation s tone: They brought up the Flint situation, and they said, unprompted, it was a failure of state government and their party. Even more telling, on February 22, Dennis Schornack, a former Sr. Policy advisor to Michigan s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, was interviewed by the Detroit Free Press.During the interview, Schornack said the Flint water crisis is the direct result of the Republican approach to governing, which promises to run government like a business.Schornack, who has plenty of insight into how the Snyder administration functions, told the Free Press, that Snyder used a  single dimension for decision-making.  He explained that Snyder uses a financial spreadsheet to make every single decision.To illustrate the point, Shornak confided that, in spite of all the talk about  Christian values,  as it turns out, Snyder s decision to oppose gay marriage was never based on his Christian beliefs, it was based on a financial spreadsheet.As the Free Press reports here, Schornack said another example of a Snyder failure related to running government like a business was his administration s handling of gay marriage, which it opposed until it was legalized by the U.S. Supreme Court. Gay marriage must be decided in the heart; safe drinking water in the laboratory,  Schornack said.But the Snyder administration used spreadsheets to address both issues, deciding gay marriage on the basis of how much it would cost the state to provide benefits to same-sex couples among state employees, he said. Schornack did not hold back when discussing how the Republican approach to governing created the Flint water crisis. Government is not a business  and it cannot be run like one,  he told the Free Press.He went on to say, The people of Flint got stuck on the losing end of decisions driven by spreadsheets instead of water quality and public health.  Having been a Snyder staffer, luckily in a spreadsheet-rich area like transportation, I lived the culture amidst its faults. Earlier this week a petition to recall Rick Snyder was approved by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers.When asked if he believes Snyder will be removed from office in November, Schornack said  The issue has totally spun out of the governor s control,  and if a recall question makes it onto the ballot,  he s dead. In light of the situation in the city of Flint, the use of the phrase  he s dead,  is entirely inappropriate.Snyder is very much alive and will continue to be alive, whether he is recalled in November or not. His political career might be dead, but he will have the luxury of living the same extravagant, greedy lifestyle he s been accustomed to, for many years to come.On the other hand, at least ten people are known to have actually died because of Snyder s poison-policy choices, which valued the almighty dollar over all things, including their health and their lives.Add to that the thousands of people who will live with the consequences of Snyder s irresponsible, immoral and illegal decisions for the rest of their lives, many of whom will die from complications associated with lead poisoning.What s worse, as the citizens of Flint struggle to cope with a crisis of monumental proportion, Republican leadership continues to put the almighty dollar before their lives and their health.On February 25, residents of Flint spoke out about the many issues that have yet to be addressed by state or federal leaders, during a town hall with Democratic presidential primary candidate Bernie Sanders.Months after the situation became public knowledge, Flint citizens still struggle to get accurate information, they continue to lack resources for healthcare and many are still faced with the challenges of collecting water from one of the designated locations in the city, without the means to do so.While state Republicans whine about the financial costs of doing the right thing in Lansing, in Washington GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz is single-handedly blocking federal funding from reaching the people of Flint.And at the front of the pack for the Republican presidential nomination is Donald Trump, a corrupt businessman, who is way more similar to Rick Snyder than GOP leaders would like to admit. Trump wants to bring the GOP s disastrous agenda for running government like a business to the entire country.If Trump s policies of hate and violence aren t enough to give you the chills, his agenda to run government like a business had better.If we don t learn from what happened in Flint, Republican leaders will bring this same dangerous agenda to every city, town and state in the country, with similarly disastrous consequences.image credit: GOP elephant from wikimedia commons, I love spreadsheets mug via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

On Friday, he announced that of all the candidates left, Trump is the one who most represents his values. Which actually makes a lot of sense, right? Donald and I have been friends for over a decade,  Christie said. The Republican governor, who dropped out from the race himself after the New Hampshire primary, called Trump a  clear standout  who can provide  strong, unequivocal leadership. What exactly does Christie mean by  strong, unequivocal leadership ? Bullying.It s a strange, twisted irony that Chris Christie saw his election chances dwindle to zero because the brash, quick-to-anger, petty governor was outdone by Trump, a man who could do all of those things, only infinitely better than Christie himself. Christie was planning on running on his record of bullying teachers and union employees, screaming at constituents and attacking political rivals with underhanded tactics. That was supposed to, in Republican terms, make him look  tough  and  capable.  But then Trump came along   a guy who had no problem telling his fans to physically beat up protesters. Who bragged about being able to kill a person in broad daylight. Who used any slight   real or imagined   to viciously go after his opponents in ways that were ugly, even for Washington. Trump is the man Christie wishes he could be.But it s a two-way street. No doubt, Christie s endorsement will help Trump solidify his place as the real front-runner in the race. Christie is considered an  establishment Republican  and his support of Trump legitimizes the former reality television star. It also helps that Christie, before he bowed out, single-handedly destroyed Marco Rubio during a debate. Now that Rubio is running at a distance second place to Trump, Christie can serve as an ever-present reminder of that surreal Robot Rubio software glitch moment.Notice in the wake of the endorsement, nothing is being said of Christie s integrity -that s simply because Christie has none. The man will gladly bash Obama to earn votes then give him a hug when he comes to save his state from a natural disaster. Then he ll go right back to bashing him. Likewise, for months, Christie told voters that Trump was a dangerous and unserious candidate. Now, he throws his reputation behind him, happy to ride his coattails all the way to a cabinet position in a Trump White House.Opportunistic, self-serving and two-faced, it s like Christie was born to endorse Trump.

So much for that  Christian Morality  that Evangelicals argue makes them better than people of other faiths and none.61-year-old Garry Meyer was the trusted treasurer of Tri-County Baptist Church in West Chester Township, Ohio for 14 years. What his church did not know, is that he was actually cooking the books, spending nearly a million dollars of church money on drugs, lavish holidays, expensive cars, pornography and  high end  escorts for more than a decade.While maintaining the pretense of a god-fearing, responsible, married father, Meyer lived a rock star lifestyle on the side   and his church community picked up the tab.But, sadly for Meyer, his wife uncovered the crime. Under pressure, he made a confession to the church. The only problem was, he  confessed  to stealing $400,000. Once the full investigation was complete, Meyer was exposed as a liar all over again. The full sum stolen was twice that figure.Meyer s wife sobbed in the courtroom as her husband s exploits were exposed, and he was sentenced to five years in prison. He told the court: There is no excuse for my actions, I also want to say I am sorry to my family. I have caused unimaginable hurt and suffering, Turning to his wife, Meyer said: I am sorry for betraying your trust   you have always been the best part of my life. Meyer stole nearly a million dollars from his own congregation in order to fund a lifestyle to which his church is supposed to stand opposed. Also speaking at Meyer s sentancing hearing was colleague Pastor Brian McManus, who said: Our church family has continued to pray for everyone involved in this very sad event. The truth is, our life choices always come down to personal   not religious   morality. A person bent on making the wrong decisions in life, will do so with or without the bible.

He chose the month of April, because, according to him, it is the time of year in which the Confederate States began and ended a four-year struggle.  Bryant says in his official proclamation: It is important for all Americans to reflect open our nation s past, to gain insight from our mistakes and successes, and to come to a full understanding that the lessons learned yesterday and today will carry us through tomorrow if we carefully and earnestly strive to understand and appreciate our heritage and our opportunities which lie before us.

And now they have a catastrophe that could cost billions of dollars to fix.And the federal government was incredibly close to chipping in much needed aid when all of a sudden Texas Senator Ted Cruz decided that the people of Flint can wait until he really studies the bill closely before they get a dime.So he placed a hold on the bill, which is pretty damn ballsy or stupid considering the Michigan GOP Primary in on March 8th and Cruz is in a serious fight for his political life with Donald Trump. Not a very smart move for a man who s going to be in a primary in Michigan on March 8,  Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow.  And in Michigan this is a hugely bipartisan nonpartisan issue that everybody cares about. Perhaps sensing that he was committing political suicide by looking like a total dick, Cruz quickly removed the hold on the bill and let it move forward.But it s just another example of why Ted Cruz should not be allowed to become president. As president, he could block any emergency disaster relief bill he wants. Plus, at a time when Americans are sick and tired of partisan bullshit in the Senate, Ted Cruz demonstrated during this particular bipartisan support of a serious problem that he s the only one who is obstructing.This legislation already had broad bipartisan support so there was no reason for Ted Cruz to hold it up beyond him just wanting attention from all the conservatives who support blocking anything and everything that might improve something in this country.Cruz eventually did the right thing, but he should never have put a hold on the bill in the first place, especially at a time when most Americans already see him as the top asshole in the presidential race.Featured Image: Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Voting for these people, voting against Donald Trump at this point, is really treason to your heritage,  Duke said on the David Duke Radio Program. BuzzFeed News first reported the comments. I m not saying I endorse everything about Trump. In fact, I haven t formally endorsed him. But I do support his candidacy, and I support voting for him as a strategic action. I hope he does everything we hope he will do. Duke also told his fellow white supremacists that they need to go out and volunteer for Trump, noting: And I am telling you that it is your job now to get active. Get off your duff. Get off your rear end that s getting fatter and fatter for many of you everyday on your chairs. When this show s over, go out, call the Republican Party, but call Donald Trump s headquarters, volunteer. Trump has consistently appealed to bigotry in his campaign. He first launched his effort by calling Mexicans rapists, then proceeded to advocate for registering Muslims and barring them from entering the United States.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""During the 1988 Democratic Presidential Primaries, Rev. Jesse Jackson emerged as an outside viable contender for the Democratic Party nomination against establishment backed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. An ardent supporter of Rev. Jesse Jackson s presidential bid was Bernie Sanders, who was mayor of Burlington, Vermont at the time.During a Democratic Caucus in Burlington, Sanders gave a speech in support of Jackson while many Democrats in the room turned their backs as he spoke, and one woman actually slapped him in the face as Sanders walked off stage. Sanders helped Rev. Jackson win Vermont against Dukakis by one delegate in 1988. Although Dukakis would later win the Democratic presidential nomination, Rev. Jackson made it closer than any black person before to becoming president. Bernie Sanders was one of the few elected officials at the time to cross the color line and openly endorse Rev. Jackson over Mike Dukakis. His speech in support of Rev. Jackson had many parallels to his speeches along his own campaign trail, such as one of his signature sayings:  enough is enough. Sanders also praised Rev. Jackson for bringing together disenfranchised voters, and focusing on issues such as wealth inequality and racial injustice. Jackson s 1988 campaign platform closely resembles Sanders  current campaign platform. Dr. Cornel West, who has been campaigning on behalf of Senator Sanders for several months and worked for both of Rev. Jackson s presidential campaigns, likened Sanders as an insurgent on par with Jesse Jackson, but even more progressive for Sanders  criticisms of Wall Street are more direct. Jesse Jackson is a serious candidate for the presidency. He was always serious; it was just that the political scientists and the other politicians who belittled his campaign, trivialized his efforts. and disdained his prospects. Despite the contempt and condescension of the media   or perhaps because of it-Jackson went to the most remote and isolated grass roots in the American social landscape to find the strength for a campaign that has already begun to transform politics, wrote the editorial board of the publication, The Nation, in its 1988 endorsement of Jesse Jackson for president.  For five years his distance from the funders, the managers, the mediators and the consultants who manipulate the Democratic Party and legitimize its candidates has allowed Jackson to do unimaginable things and say unspeakable words   about race, about class, about equality and, indeed, about democracy. To an extent that may be unique in presidential elections in this century, he derives his power from the people. Nearly two decades later, not much has changed in that the issues brought to the national spotlight by Jesse Jackson have yet to be adequately addressed by the Democratic party in a meaningful way, and are rarely ever mentioned in the Republican Party at all.Bernie Sanders  campaign provides hope that those inadequacies may be resolved if he wins. Galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice, hundreds of thousands of Americans have packed his rallies, and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund-raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money,  wrote the editorial board of The Nation in its 2016 endorsement of Sanders for president.  Sanders s clarion call for fundamental reform single-payer healthcare, tuition-free college, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the breaking up of the big banks, ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes has inspired working people across the country. The relationship between Bernie Sanders and Rev. Jesse Jackson has started to become more public in response to criticisms from Hillary Clinton supporters that Sanders would somehow be less effective in fighting for civil rights and racial justice. Clinton s lead in South Carolina is dependent on maintaining her support with the black community, who make up about half of Democratic voters in the state, but that relationship was somewhat strained after her loss there in 2008 was cited by her husband, Bill Clinton, as due to Barack Obama being another black candidate like Jesse Jackson, who won the state in 2008.In an interview with the Hill, Rev. Jesse Jackson said he had no plans to endorse any Democratic presidential candidate, as he has a history of working with both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. An endorsement would also likely have negative implications regarding support for his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.Despite his neutrality, Jackson did defend Bernie Sanders from criticism over his civil rights record recently in an interview with the Daily Caller: Bernie was fighting back in Chicago not in the deep-south   in affordable housing struggles in Chicago,  Jackson said.  The movement was so broad based. There were civil rights leaders in Chicago. Jackson referred to a smear tactic employed by journalists and media sensationalists to skew a response from civil rights hero, Congressman John Lewis (D-GA). Rep. Lewis responded to a reporter s inquiry that he never saw or met Bernie Sanders during the civil rights movement, but the response was taken out of context to infer Lewis suggested Bernie Sanders was not involved in the civil rights movement or was exaggerating his involvement. Having heard Rep. Lewis speak a few months ago and interviewing him in person afterwards, I knew an accusation or character attack of that nature from the congressman was highly unlikely. Congressman Lewis clarified the remarks were not meant to be taken as any sort of criticism or allegations. Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Maybe you were out of gas or milk or needed medicine and you didn t have enough money in your account, but you really, really needed something so you swiped your debit card and were hit with an overdraft fee   you are not alone. Millions of Americans are charged these fees, usually about $35 (in my experience). So many people are hit with these fees that they are very profitable for big banks. A new report has found that financial institutions made more than eleven billion dollars from these fees in 2015, alone.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)   established by Senator Elizabeth Warren in 2010   issued the report and found that 594 banks (worth more than $1 billion) fleeced the American people out of $11.16 billion last year.Some of the highlights the CFPB reported about overdraft and nonsufficient funds fees:Overdraft fees are one of the most predatory practices of big banks. Many of you have probably been hit by a bunch of overdraft fees at once. Say you go to the store and you buy that gallon of milk, but other transactions haven t cleared in your account yet. That gallon of milk may cause you to incur multiple overdraft fees because the banks use  fee-harvesting  software that reorganizes your transactions so that they can charge you multiple times.These shady practices are one of the reasons banks are now required to disclose their overdraft fee profits. Elizabeth Warren had a big role in these new rules because of her crusade to save the middle class and the working poor from Wall Street s love of exorbitant consumer fees. In 2012 Warren said: People enroll in overdraft programs to avoid bouncing checks, but too many of them get stuck owing hundreds of dollars in unexpected fees for services they never wanted and didn t know they had,  said Warren, one of the nation s experts on bankruptcy and consumer credit.   The new consumer agency is heading in the right direction to make sure that people have the tools and information they need to avoid these traps. The establishment of the CFPB has helped, in 2012 banks made three times as much ($32 billion) in fees from customers. But for the working class families who are struggling to survive, it s still not enough. We need real reform and banks because it is a huge problem when Wall Street s business model is  rob as many families as we possibly can.

Since there were only 125 people who identified as Latino in the state, and the exit poll had a margin of error of 10% because of the tiny sample size, the reality is that a meaningless number of Hispanic people actually support Trump. I d like to know who those Hispanics are,  Fox said of Trump s inflated number, urging even those individuals to  open their eyes : Please, you Hispanics, Latinos in the U.S., open your eyes. It s not to defend our race. Not to defend our creed. It s to defend this very same nation that is hosting you. This nation is going to fail if it goes into the hands of a crazy guy. As for the wall, Fox made it very clear that he nor anyone from Mexico will be paying for Trump s signature policy symbol:Fox is not the first former Mexican leader to speak out against Trump s hatred. Earlier this month, former President Felipe Calderon told Trump where to stick it: We are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall! And it s going to be completely useless. No offense, no offense to America. So Donald Trump   is ambitious but not exactly very well-informed man, I don t want to say ignorant, but he is not very well informed. Naturally, after having a SECOND leader from our neighbor to the South inform him that his  make Mexico pay for the wall  idea isn t going to pan out, Trump is a little angry.

Most items that are produced from forced labor are banned from being imported into the United States. However, due to a small provision in the tariff Act of 1930 some goods produced from slavery have been allowed been exempted from the ban.Goods that are not produced in a high enough quantity in the US are exempt from the force labor ban. Things like chocolate, rubber, and even shrimp are some of the major imports that are produced from slave labor. According to Reuters, Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said: The mere deterrent effect of closing this loophole is a great step forward. We re going to make sure that is heavily noted throughout the world. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat (of course) from Ohio is the one who introduced the amendment to end the exemption. It s embarrassing that for 85 years, the United States let products made with forced labor into this country, and closing this loophole gives the U.S. an important tool to fight global slavery,  Brown said.Slavery is banned all across the globe. That being said, the number of people living in slavery is at an all-time historical high. Right now there are an estimated 30 million people who are living as slaves. That s an alarming figure. The nation with the highest number of people held in slavery is Mauritania. Research has shown that as much as 10% of Mauritania s population is enslaved. They were also the last nation on Earth to officially outlaw slavery, holding out until 1981.The Global Slavery Index estimates that there 60k slaves in the United States. It should be mentioned that there are some criticisms of the GSI worth keeping in mind. Slavery Footprint is an excellent online tool that lets people get an idea of what items they have been purchasing come from slave labor. You can use it to get a better sense of what items you may have been using that may have come from slave labor. Thanks to this legislation, many of those items will no longer be allowed into the US if they come from slave labor.Featured image from The White House [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Even more conservative Americans are coming around to the fact that the GOP hasn t been doing its part and is actually worsening the country while embarrassing us all.On Tuesday, Republican Sheriff Newell Normand had a moment of clarity during the Metropolitan Crime Commission s annual awards luncheon in Louisiana. Normand is a Republican himself, but he couldn t hold back his disappointment in the party when he slammed the GOP s elected officials and the state s former Governor, Bobby Jindal, in his speech.According to Normand, Jindal was a complete fool who made a mess of Louisiana s finances and was more like a cult leader than a governor. Admitting that he had once  endorsed that idiot , Normand was left disappointed and regretted standing behind Jindal once he was governor and left Louisiana in shambles. The enraged cop entertained the audience by calling Jindal out: What a mess. Bobby Jindal was a better cult leader than Jim Jones.  We drank the elixir for eight years, we remained in a conscious state, we walked to the edge of the cliff, we jumped off and he watched us. And guess what? Unlike Jim Jones, he did not swallow the poison. What a shame. Normand also accused Jindal of attempting to rewrite history by using social media to reframe his handling of the budget, even when the rest of the state doesn t  even know what history is.  Currently, Louisiana is facing a hefty budget shortfall of $2.5 billion, but Jindal is bragging on Twitter about what a great job he did as governor. Normand isn t having it. He said: We have to just say no! I m a Republican but I m not a hypocrite. We have to look at ourselves critically as a party and figure out where we are and what we re going to be about. Thanks to Jindal, the state is trying to fix is budget problems by cutting funding to mental health and closing several state prisons   all which initiatives will cause issues for law enforcement. Suggesting that Republicans stop attacking and actually start working on solutions, Normand noted that a Medicaid expansion would take care of costs like mental health and drug addiction. The frustrated sheriff slammed conservatives once more, telling them to actually get to work instead of blaming Obama for the country s woes: And I have to listen to my Republican counterparts talk about gobbledigook. Blah, blah blah  And I m so sick and tired of hearing: Obama, Obama, Obama. You know how much intellect it takes to blame something on somebody else? This much!

So, it s always nice when we can bring you news that will warm your hearts and make you smile   and the following story will do just that.David Robert Wetzell (known as  Bob ), of Urbana, Ohio passed away and left his entire estate to establish an Animal Welfare League in Champaign County. According to the executor of his estate, Ronald Tompkins, Wetzell left instructions for him to liquidate his estate   worth about $3 million   and build the shelter, but with very specific guidelines.Wetzell left instructions in his will for Tompkins to sell his assets and use the money to establish the shelter and purchase a secluded farm in Champaign County. It is to be used as an animal preserve, pet cemetery, dog training facility and rehabilitation home for unwanted pets.The new shelter will be modeled after Animal Welfare League of Clark County in Springfield which was established in 1959 and currently houses 90 cats and 45 dogs. Libby Adams who runs the Clark County shelter with her husband said: I know it will take a while to build up to what we have. It s not going to happen overnight. Ours took a few years to get to what we have now Bob was very fond and proud of our organization. He would come down on occasion. He was a member of our league for as long as I can remember and supported us. She said that he often told her that he wanted to open one up when he was alive, but he didn t know how to go about getting it started.Wetzell had no human family members except a few distant cousins, but he was survived by six cats, a 20-year-old parakeet, a dog and seven chickens. Tompkins kept the dog and found homes for his other pets.It is awesome that Wetzell did something like this with his estate. There are so many animals that need a home, and this sounds like it is going to be a pet paradise. I wish there were more people in the world like him.

Defendants goes beyond a manipulation, twist, strain, or unique perspective on the text and crosses over in to an abandonment of the Constitution,  Burdick claims in the lawsuit. For centuries the Constitution has been the instrument of protection for the rights of citizens against government intrusion, specifically, since the ratification of the 14th Amendment in 1868, interpreted the plain language of the Constitution and that amendment to be a guarantee of freedom from government interference in individual liberty. Clearly, Burdick probably should not have been able to pass the bar, because his argument is ridiculous. The ruling made by the high court in Obergefell v. Hodges is the perfect demonstration of the Supreme Court ruling precisely because the Constitution protects the rights of citizens, which includes the rights of gay people. But Burdick claims the Justices rewrote the Constitution. The opinion in fact rewrites the 14th Amendment to read:  Every state must make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States; further, each state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law under the guise of extending tax benefits or some other license; and any person within its jurisdiction may be deprived of the equal protection of the laws when it is fashionable to do so.' Seriously, how did this idiot get a law license?The fact is that the 14th Amendment guarantees every American citizen equal protection and due process, something that bigots like Burdick have been denying to LGBT people for decades. He is literally whining because he thinks the Constitution should allow him to discriminate against gay people.The Constitution was not rewritten and there is no reason why Burdick cannot continue to practice law, although there are reasons why he should not be allowed to do so. Suing the highest ranking judges in the nation is frivolous and a waste of the judiciary s time. The Supreme Court has the final say on what is constitutional and what is not. It says so right in the very Constitution Burdick claims has been destroyed.Burdick has apparently felt  threatened  by same-sex marriage since last May when he wrote on his website that all same-sex couples are after is benefits while claiming that same-sex couples haven t been denied anything at all.No same sex couple is prevented from proclaiming that they are committed to each other. No same sex couple is prevented from conducting a ceremony of their own choosing or design to add dignity to their relationship. No same sex couple is prevented from exchanging rings and vows. No same sex couple is prevented from endeavoring to live happily ever after. No same sex couple is prevented from referring to their partner as their  spouse.  Further, no same sex couple is prevented from announcing to the world that they are married. In fact, many of the same people who have rushed to the courthouse for a license state that they have been  married  for years.Make no mistake, this lawsuit is just another part of Burdick s temper tantrum. He claims same-sex couples already have the right the get married when in reality many states, including Alabama, banned same-sex couples from getting married before the Supreme Court ruling. In fact, Alabama is still trying to deny same-sex couples that right.Any self-respecting judge should laugh Burdick out of court since this is clearly just another desperate ploy by conservatives to keep their anti-gay hate alive.

Holder said in a recently released Frontline interview: You know, we treat marijuana in the same way that we treat heroin now, and that clearly is not appropriate. So at a minimum, I think Congress needs to do that. Then I think we need to look at what happens in Colorado and what happens in Washington. What is unfortunate is that at one time, Eric Holder actually did have the power to at least initiate unilateral marijuana legalization through studies done by Health and Human Services. In the case of marijuana, there are two options to legalize:Courtesy of Brookings Yes, that means that Eric Holder had the keys to the shiny new pot plant but he never used them.

The organization has its origins in Austria and dates back to the 1600 s.The Post reported that Scalia was at the ranch with members of the secret society and that he had met with them on different occasions, and once previously at the same ranch where he died. The Post reports:The group, consisting of a bunch of creepy, older men, is hundreds of years old with rituals and costumes.  They opened a chapter in the US for the first time in 1968 at the famous Bohemian Grove in San Fransisco, which is apparently an elite place for holding secret society meetings and a source of controversy throughout the years of its existence.Here s  how the group describes itself on its website: The International Order of Saint Hubertus was founded in 1695 by Count Franz Anton von Sporck in what was then the Kingdom of Bohemia, then territory of the Habsburg Empire, now the modern Czech Republic. The Order was a knightly order with an emphasis on hunting and activities related to the pursuit and management of game animals. In the Middle Ages and again with the revival of interest in the forms of chivalry in Europe, hunting was considered a basic preparation for warfare and was held among the highest activities a gentleman could pursue. In addition, Count von Sporck was also a prominent patron of music, having commissioned numerous Vivaldi operas and the four Bach minor Masses for performance at his private Opera House in Prague.  While the group claims to be a simple organization for hunting enthusiasts, its ties to the controversial Bohemian Grove leave many questions unanswered. Former president Bill Clinton once said of the club:  The Bohemian club! Did you say Bohemian club? That s where all those rich Republicans go up and stand naked against redwood trees right?

The proposed law makes an allowance for another family member to be substituted who will provide financial support for the child if a father can t or won t be listed.A portion of the bill reads as below: Provides that if the unmarried mother cannot or refuses to name the child s father, either a father must be conclusively established by DNA evidence or, within 30 days after birth, another family member who will financially provide for the child must be named, in court, on the birth certificate. Provides that absent DNA evidence or a family member s name, a birth certificate will not be issued and the mother will be ineligible for financial aid from the State for support of the child.

What the hell kind of logic is that?This is not the first time Republicans have attempted to actively sabotage the lives of women and children who are in the most desperate of need. Last year, State Rep. Jeanne Ives made remarks along a similar theme during a budget-related debate: You need to have verifiable need.

Republicans would outlaw all contraception and abortion, even in cases of rape. A woman undergoes that heinous assault, and she can t get an abortion because Republicans  love life too much  to let her make that choice on her own.

We have heard about all of the big donors, all of the Republican Party elders, all of the people in Congress who are basically saying anyone but Trump. Camerota piled on more, reading an editorial from the Washington Post that was critical of Priebus and his apparent cowardice to stand up to Trump and his hate-fueled campaign. The reaction from Priebus was simply priceless. I ve heard comebacks from 13-year-old schoolboys that were better.The best part of it, though, is watching Priebus have to try to respond to the attacks calling him a powerless leader without also insulting Trump.

He knew that if he showed his returns he would not only be displaying how much he truly makes, but he would be revealing how much he actually pays in taxes. Now, Romney has decided to go after present-day Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for the very same reason.Romney seems to be legitimately concerned that there may be some sort of  bombshell  hidden within Trump s taxes that will show something the American people won t like at all.While appearing on Fox News with Neil Cavuto, Romney said: I d like to see a number of things from the candidates, not just their positions on issues, in some detail. And some candidates are more thorough in laying out what they re going to do than others. But I d also like to see their back taxes. I d like to see where they filed their taxes in the last several years. I m not talking about their taxes this year. I m talking about the taxes that have already been filed with the IRS. And Donald Trump and Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have not shown us their back taxes. You know, this was an issue in my campaign.They were all over me for my taxes, it became a big issue. But I put my taxes out in January of 2012. And that gave people a chance to digest it and decide whether I was going to be the nominee or not. If in fact Donald Trump s taxes or Marco Rubio s or Ted Cruz s have some real problems in there, let s get them out there and see them. But I think it s pretty clear that given Donald Trump s dodging and weaving and delay, I think the last time he was asked about his taxes he said,  well, it s going to be a month.  Look, people have a right to know if there s a problem in those taxes before they decide. Romney also said: We have good reason to believe that there s a bombshell in Donald Trump s taxes Either he s not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is, or he hasn t been paying taxes we would expect him to pay or perhaps he hasn t been giving money to vets or to the disabled like he s been telling us he s been doing. Now, besides just accusing Trump of random things, let s think about this for a second. Is Romney actually concerned about what s in Trump s taxes, or is he just trying to do to Trump what was done to him? Maybe it s some sort of sweet revenge for him. However you look at it, Romney looks like a giant walking and talking hypocrite, and one of the first to point that out was none other than Trump himself.Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2016He s not wrong. That does seem to be exactly what he s doing.Either way, Trump should make his finances transparent to the American voting public so they can judge for themselves if they approve of the way Trump handles his finances, but Romney, especially on this issue, should probably keep his mouth shut.

It s hard to imagine any school has gone as far as Texas s Republican-led legislature. Professors may be worried students could get offended by a lecture, but few schools have to tell their professors to avoid  triggering  their students or else risk being shot in their classroom.Needless to say, many professors are not okay with this new way of doing things.Despite Republicans assuring the public that they are doing this to keep people safe, the students and professors themselves want nothing to do with this terrifying plan. It s led to demonstrations by students at schools like the University of Texas at Austin, and now, an unprecedented 168 professors from over 30 departments have signed a pledge that they will not take part in this bone-headed scheme.Republicans have ignored their concerns entirely. Instead, they are high-fiving the NRA lobbyists who put them up to it. So a few more kids might die in Texas schools? It s a small price to pay for  freedom.

David Faulkner quickly introduced a bill to ban it from going into effect, along with banning cities and counties from trying to raise the minimum wage for their citizens in the future.It s not a surprise, frankly. After all, Republicans are more in favor of eliminating the minimum wage entirely than they are of raising it to help struggling workers and families pay the bills and put food on the table without having to rely on federal and state assistance.Indeed, Alabama currently ranks as one of the worst welfare states in the nation, taking in $2.46 for every dollar they send to the federal government. So, one would think that Republicans would be happy to make sure that workers are paid so they don t have to rely on the government. Sadly, that isn t the case.But the Birmingham city council chose to vote again to implement the new wage increase immediately, thereby cutting Alabama Republicans off at the pass and flipping them off along the way. We need to make sure our citizens are taken care of and that we re making decisions in their best interest,  said Council President Johnathan Austin.The minimum wage in Alabama currently stands at $7.25, because the federal wage applies since the state doesn t have a minimum wage law. But Birmingham, the largest city in the state, is saying enough is enough and will have a higher minimum wage than any state in South.Faulkner tried to justify his anti-minimum wage bill by claiming that having different wages creates issues.However, by passing this ordinance, Birmingham is improving the lives of the workers who live there while telling everybody else across the state that if you want to be paid fairly for your hard work, come to Birmingham. That could end up sparking other cities in Alabama to raise the wage as well to compete. Mobile, Alabama is already considering a wage increase as well.The measure only needs to be signed by the mayor and be published for public view and it will take effect on March 1st.Featured image via Reddit""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Trump accused Cruz of being  the one that pushed  for President George W. Bush to nominate Chief Justice John Roberts, who Trump thought was an awful justice for a very specific reason   Obamacare.

Last year was also a success, as 2014-2015 marked a hot streak that America hadn t seen since 1998 and 1999. And regardless of what Republicans say, the private sector hasn t seen any loss of jobs since March 2010, when Obamacare was signed into law.Data has also proven that Obamacare, which has enabled more people to receive quality diagnoses and treatments earlier, is saving lives and helping Americans save money as well. The GOP loves to complain about Obamacare s premiums, but its implementation, unpaid hospital bills have seen a drastic decline in cost and number.This is just another instance where Trump goes off on something he knows absolutely nothing about.

She is well-known for her  blue-eyed/brown-eyed  experiment (you can read more about that here) which taught her young students in Iowa how racism is learned, not something they are born with. In 1992, she appeared on Oprah s stage along with a group of racists who were convinced that they were better than minorities. The elderly school teacher told the ignorant white people who were basking in their  superiority  just how wrong they were: I heard somebody in the green room say that racism is inbred, no it is not. Racism is not part of the human condition. Racism is a learned response you have to be taught to be a racist, you are not born racist   you are born into a racist society. And like anything else if you can learn it, you can unlearn it. But people like this choose not to unlearn it because they are afraid they will lose power if they share it with other people. They are afraid of sharing power, that s what it s all about. This is absolutely true. I am sure that you have probably heard a right-winger say, Everyone is a little bit racist, we are born that way.  This is not true at all. Babies are like blank canvases, they are taught every single thing they know. People and society teach children to be racist, nobody is preconditioned to hate. That s nonsense.Elliot went on to tell the hate-filled idiots on the stage that they suffered from a mental illness: What we re dealing here with is mental illness. Racism is mental illness. Racism was defined by the President s Joint Council On Mental Health In Children in 1959 as being the number one mental health problem among children in the United States. And they didn t say  among black children,  they said  among children.  If you judge other people by the color of their skin, by the amount of a chemical in their skin, you have a mental problem. You are not dealing well with reality. She is correct. Judging somebody because their skin is darker than yours due to extra melanin is as ridiculous as it is sick.This conversation took place more than two decades ago and yet, it still resonates today. We have an entire political party that consistently campaigns on platforms of racism and hate. Look at Donald Trump s rise to the top, while KKK members appear at caucuses with Trump signs to show their support in 2016.

A moment later, as if the possibility had just dawned on him for the very first time, Carson added,  or maybe they did maybe they were doing it on purpose. It s impossible to tell if Carson is extremely stupid or extremely good at acting stupid. Either way, he would be an extremely terrifying president.As Addicting Info reported in January, Ben Carson s campaign staff started jumping ship on New Year s Eve, with more than 20 of former staffers resigning in a 24 hour period.The resignations followed months of accusations that the candidate s campaign is little more than a money-making scheme, which also doubles as a promotional tour to sell books.The fact that Carson s campaign has been raising money hand over fist, but investing very little in actual campaign activities, was just one indicator that Carson s presidential campaign was a hoax.As New York Magazine pointed out months ago, the Carson campaign is  structured much more like a scamming venture than a political one. As evidence, New York Magazine also reported, An astronomical 69 percent of his fund-raising totals are spent on more fund-raising. (Bernie Sanders, by contrast, spends just 4 percent of his intake on fund-raising.) In addition to direct mail, Carson seems to have undertaken a massive phone-spamming operation. Spending most of your money to raise more money is not a good way to get elected president, but it is a good way to build a massive list of supporters that can later be monetized. Perhaps it is a giveaway that the official title for Armstrong Williams, the figure running the Carson  campaign,  is  business manager,  as opposed to  campaign manager.  It does suggests that Carson is engaged in a for-profit venture. Even more telling, a significant number of the companies hired to run Carson s costly telemarketing and direct-mail campaigns just happen to be run by friends and family members of staffers.Then there s the fact that, while Carson s fundraising totals surpass that of every other GOP candidate, his polling numbers are terrible.While Carson told CNN that  things are much better  with his campaign now, according to the Atlantic, not much has changed.The campaign is still spending huge amounts of money on raising more money, diverting millions to businesses like TMA Direct, which is owned by Mark Murray, one of Carson s top fundraisers.According to the Atlantic, Murray has also long worked with Eleventy and InfoCision, two Akron, Ohio-based companies. InfoCision has been implicated in past scams. Eleventy s president is chief marketing officer for Carson. Communication Management Source is run by Joanne Parker, whose husband Dean Parker departed the campaign in December. According to the latest financial disclosures, the Carson campaign paid Eleventy Marketing $4.8 million in the last quarter, while InfoCision got a whopping $2.4 million. Communication Management Source didn t make out quite as well, being paid $1.3 million.It s almost impossible to believe that Carson doesn t know whether or not his campaign is a scam to bilk low-information conservative voters out of millions of dollars.His weird, out-of-place laughter, combined with his sad attempts to convince the public that it s all behind him now, are pretty good indicators that he s more than aware that his campaign is a hoax.With the money still rolling in, though, Carson is clearly going to try to keep the scam going for as long as he possibly can.Image from wikipedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

However, that s not going to prevent Obama from doing his job, and he really hopes these  sheepish  Republicans step up and do their job as well.Obama said: I m going to do my job. I recognize the politics are hard for them [Senate Republicans] because the easier thing to do is to give in to the most extreme voices within their party and stand pat and do nothing. But that s not our job. Our job is to fulfill our constitutional duties.

We ll see what happens and I think the situation may evolve over time. I don t expect Mitch McConnell to say that is the case today.

This was in response to an incident on Monday, where Trump flipped out at a heckler that interrupted his rally in Nevada. The front-runner said he wanted to punch the protester in the face, giving a rather detailed description of how he d like to hurt the man with threats like You know what they used to do with guys like that when they were in a place like this? They d be carried out on a stretcher, folks. I think that s the sentiment you see from the average person. They re sick of being beat up, they re sick of being pushed around by everyone, they re sick of not having a voice anymore. That s just something that s unusual. Trump has actually become infamous for the violence at his campaign rallies   which he has usually encouraged. People who are brave enough to show up and protest are usually met with threats and sometimes physical assaults, even in instances where they re being completely peaceful, silent and merely holding a sign. But to Trump and his son, any violence that comes to protesters for using their First Amendment rights is completely deserved. Don said: I mean, if someone s trying to break up something, doing a great thing, there s 10,000 people in a room, watching an incredible event, and someone s trying to heckle them, I mean, I think it s a pretty natural response, and I think people love that he s honest about that.

Republicans have made it their mission to prevent any person President Obama appoints from getting anywhere near the Supreme Court, even going so far as to say they won t remotely consider anyone until a new president is in office. However, President Obama knows that it s his constitutional responsibility to appoint someone into the role, and it s a responsibility he takes very seriously.In a post to the prominent SCOTUSblog, President Obama lays down why he s still going forward and appointing someone, why he ll be appointing them, the qualities he s looking for in a Justice, and expects Republicans to follow through with their constitutional duty as well.He writes: The Constitution vests in the President the power to appoint judges to the Supreme Court.  It s a duty that I take seriously, and one that I will fulfill in the weeks ahead.It s also one of the most important decisions that a President will make.  Rulings handed down by the Supreme Court directly affect our economy, our security, our rights, and our daily lives.Needless to say, this isn t something I take lightly.  It s a decision to which I devote considerable time, deep reflection, careful deliberation, and serious consultation with legal experts, members of both political parties, and people across the political spectrum.  And with thanks to SCOTUSblog for allowing me to guest post today, I thought I d share some spoiler-free insights into what I think about before appointing the person who will be our next Supreme Court Justice.First and foremost, the person I appoint will be eminently qualified.  He or she will have an independent mind, rigorous intellect, impeccable credentials, and a record of excellence and integrity.  I m looking for a mastery of the law, with an ability to hone in on the key issues before the Court, and provide clear answers to complex legal questions.Second, the person I appoint will be someone who recognizes the limits of the judiciary s role; who understands that a judge s job is to interpret the law, not make the law.  I seek judges who approach decisions without any particular ideology or agenda, but rather a commitment to impartial justice, a respect for precedent, and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand.But I m also mindful that there will be cases that reach the Supreme Court in which the law is not clear.  There will be cases in which a judge s analysis necessarily will be shaped by his or her own perspective, ethics, and judgment.  That s why the third quality I seek in a judge is a keen understanding that justice is not about abstract legal theory, nor some footnote in a dusty casebook.

Trump speaks like a third grader. Trump rarely utters a word that isn t in the 850 words included in the Basic English language. A politician s ability to inspire voters is an important part of being a great leader. Then again, Trump isn t actually a politician. He s a billionaire has-been reality TV star.Then again, Trump is speaking to his supporters, who have been shown to have a similar grasp of the English language.No president is perfect and that includes President Obama. However, he has consistently proven that when he talks he sounds like he is the only adult in the room. Part of that reason is his ability to speak with passion. It also helps that he has reason backing his message. When he has something to say, people listen. That s part of the reason he was elected president twice. As the then Senator Obama said on the night of his first primary election  They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose. You can watch President Obama s victory speech after his win in Iowa. It s a throwback to a time when Obama made national history for the first time.Featured image from Gage Skidmore via Flickr and By Chuck Kennedy (Official White House photo) (The Official White House Photostream on Flickr) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Because what could possibly go wrong?According to Iowa Public Radio,Democrat Kirsten Running-Marquardt asked what kind of gun would fit into the hands of a two or three year old. I ve got the bill right in front of me,  Running-Marquardt said.  It s a valid question. You re missing the whole point of the bill,  replied Johnston Republican Jake Highfill.  I think this is one of the best bills we ve done for second amendment rights. Current Iowa law prohibits children under the age of 14 from possessing handguns and ammunition, which is a reasonable measure considering 10,000 kids are injured or killed every year by guns, one-fifth of which are accidents.And that s not even counting the accidental shootings of adults by children who handle guns.Democratic Rep. Mary Mascher pointed out that a nine-year old girl had parental and instructor supervision at an Arizona gun range when she accidentally shot and killed the instructor because she couldn t handle the gun. Unfortunately the instructor and the parents made the wrong decision and someone died,  Mascher said.  Every three hours in this country a child dies from gun violence. And that s not the only example showing why kids should not be allowed to have access to guns.In January 2015, a five-year-old boy killed his little brother with a gun that he found lying around the house.In August of the same year, a four-year-old boy shot and killed his own mother after finding a gun in the car that he thought was a toy.Then there s the 11-year-old boy who killed a little girl because she wouldn t let him pet her puppy.Or how about the three-year-old boy who has to live with the knowledge that he accidentally shot and killed his mom in 2014 after finding a loaded gun under the couch.And then there s the story of a five-year-old boy who shot and killed his little sister with a rifle he had just been given for his birthday. His parents believed that a child safety feature would be enough to keep the gun from accidentally being fired.The bottom line is that toddlers have no clue what a gun is and lack the physical and mental capacity to handle a firearm responsibly, no matter what the NRA says. And there are clearly many parents who are stupid when it comes to mixing guns and kids, the results of which are horrifying and heartbreaking. And you can be sure that there will be more dead kids and parents if this bill becomes law.The bill now heads to the Democrat-controlled Iowa Senate, where logic and reason will hopefully prevail.Featured image via Freakout Nation""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Whether its Trump s antics, Cruz s lies, or Rubio s roboticism, it s not looking to good for the party to take back the presidency. The latest comic book tale comes from one John Kasich who said that  women left the kitchen to vote for him when he first ran for office in 1978.In a sign that Fox News is desperately trying to resurrect an establishment candidate for the nomination, host Megyn Kelly, who has earned a reputation for being straightforward and even tough on candidates when they say stupid things, was surprisingly playful with Kasich. After playing a clip of Kasich s kitchen remark, Kelly was friendly and self-deprecating: I can certainly say that if it were my husband, he d say,  For the love of God, get out of the kitchen! No one wants you in here! You do bad things in here! The two then had a creepy chuckle which immediately put Kasich at ease. She even went as far as to rationalize his women in the kitchen comment, saying: Back in 1978 when you first ran for office, 70% of women were not working out of the home full time, they just weren t. The vast majority of women were at home and things have changed a lot since then. These comments put Kasich at ease and he then went on to say how much he supposedly respects women by giving examples. He said: But let s be real about this. You know, my campaign manager is a woman, she used to be my chief of staff and if I m president, who knows? She ll have one of the highest positions in the country. I have a lieutenant governor who s a woman. You know, the situation is, I appointed a lady to the Ohio Supreme Court, you know, obviously a woman. And I ve a number of very influential women cabinet members. Not only did Kelly let him off the hook with his comments and rehabilitated him, but she conveniently forgot to ask Kasich about signing a bill that would defund Planned Parenthood in his home state of Ohio.After Kelly had admirably grilled Trump about his comments about women, she disappointingly let Kasich off the hook. This is a sign Fox News is playing favoritism in its quest to rehabilitate an establishment candidate for the nomination.Here s the video:Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The only problem is that instead of a meeting in a normal setting, the two chose a storage closet instead, which as Meyers pointed out, is pretty ironic considering both men are anti-gay. That s right, Cruz and Carson met inside of a storage closet. A moment I m sure both of them, as anti-gay rights advocates immediately regretted when they realized that eventually they would have to come out of the closet, together,  Meyers quipped.But Cruz hasn t only played dirty tricks against Ben Carson. His new target has been Marco Rubio with ploys such as making it appear like Rubio and President Obama are alike or making up stories about how Rubio trashed the Bible in front of Cruz staffers.Meyers also noted that even Republicans have called out Cruz for saying and doing anything to get elected, regaling the audience about how Cruz took a pro-fireworks stance on a local issue because staffers found 60 people who would vote for him if he took up their cause.Here s the video via YouTube.Ever since he won Iowa, Ted Cruz has not fared very well. New Hampshire chose Donald Trump, and even South Carolina couldn t stomach Ted Cruz as the nominee as evangelical voters abandoned him for the billionaire loudmouth. It even looks like he could lose in his home state of Texas as newspapers in Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio are endorsing anybody but Cruz as the GOP nominee.

The New YorkerSomething startling is happening to middle-aged white Americans.

LA TimesIsn t it amazing how white people dying is suddenly a HUGE problem that needs to be addressed? Apparently, much of the spike is attributable to drugs, drinking, suicide and lack of proper healthcare. That, in turn, is attributable to the Great Recession as millions of people s lives were destroyed by forces outside of their control.Not to belittle their suffering (much) but boohoo. The black community has been dealing with this kind of widespread economic destruction for decades. There s a reason that every other corner in a ghetto is a liquor store (drive through parts of D.C. and you ll see what I mean) and drug use is rampant and it s not because black people are morally deficient as some people (conservatives) would like you to believe.But now that white people are facing the same levels of despair and lack of opportunity, they re responding in much the same way and America is very VERY concerned about their welfare. We need to DO SOMETHING about this crisis!This hypocrisy ties into the sudden about face on the war on drugs. Once upon a time, society needed to throw every drug user into to jail for decades at a time to protect society. That most of those arrested just happened to be black was just a coincidence, surely. These days, however, drug use has exploded in white neighborhoods as meth and heroin use are skyrocketing.But instead of demands for more mass incarceration, we hear pleas for mercy and understanding.

Trump, flanked by security, was immediately mobbed by the GOP fans in the room. He then picked up a microphone and began his own impromptu speech, cutting Beck dead.The crowd seemed all-too-happy to have their Cruz-fest interrupted by the GOP favorite, gathering tightly around the candidate and cheering in response to his weird and creepy speech.MSNBC happened to be broadcasting live at the Palo Verde High School in Summerlin, and was able to capture the bizarre scenes in full.Beck stood in silence on the stage, looking on helplessly as his event was overtaken by Trump, who told crowds: We are going to have hopefully a historic night, I appreciate everybody being here.

It appears that the Trump campaign is unassailable at this point, although a week is a long time in U.S. politics.Graphic via GuardianPerhaps the darkest moment of the night was when Trump actually said these words in his victory speech: We won with poorly educated! I love the poorly educated! There were whopping cheers and applause for this comment. Which seemingly bore zero irony. He continued: We re the smartest people. We re the most loyal people. First things first: Donald Trump is not poorly educated. He attended the Kew Forest School until 8th grade before spending the rest of his schooling in the New York Military Academy. He later won a bachelors degree in Economic from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. So, another total lie from this candidate.One reason  poorly educated  might appeal to Trump though, is that part of the education process is to give a person the tools to think critically about an issue, and to fact-check arguments. It is not to say you cannot have these skills without a decent high school education, but it s an uphill struggle. It s not impossible to save a person having a heart attack without having had medical training, but you d put your money on the doctor every time.So, now wonder Trump would like to keep America under-educated.According to leading fact-checking site Politifact, just 1% of claims made by Donald Trump are true. One percent! Meanwhile, 3 out of every 5 statements he makes are absolute lies. Let s take a look back at some of those lies:They just keep on coming.And on the matter of faith, Donald Trump is now claiming to be some sort of born again evangelical. Yet, Trump has been married three times, pokes fun of Holy Communion as eating  the little cracker , claims he has never asked God to forgive his sins in his life, and could not name a single passage of the Bible when pressed for his favorite piece of scripture.Trump is about as devout a Christian as Bill Nye.And yet, he is winning evangelical support in droves. Why? Because the evangelical, Christian Conservative movement has zero to do with faith in God, and everything to do with a fanatical conviction in right-wing principles of crony capitalism, white supremacy, homophobia and sexism.If this was not the case, Trump would be the LAST candidate that appealed to Evangelicals. To any right-thinking Christian, he is the 21st century incarnation of the Whore of Babylon.But Trump gets a pass for all of this, because under-educated people are having their ignorance exploited, and bigoted people are having their bellies tickled. This resurgent right is euphoric that it s candidate can say things on national television that have been outlawed in workplaces and public spaces for decades. They are thrilled that hate has been made mainstream by their candidate, and they are going to come out in their droves to support him.This means that voting in this year s election will be the most important ballots cast on American soil in a very long time. The reproductive rights of women, the rights of LGBT Americans, the rights of non-Christians, the rights of victims of rape and sexual assault, the rights of victims of gun crime, the rights of non-white Americans   they are all on the chopping block in this election.  Every American with a conscience and a sense of decency has the absolute duty to make a stand against this sh*tstorm of stupidity, bigotry and ignorance.

The short answer to that question is a resounding NO!! From Salon:Bee noted the candidate s scarcely mentioned record on gay marriage ( Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage, was originally called Obergefell v. Kasich ) and reproductive rights (citing Michael Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, who said,  There is no candidate running for president who has done more for the pro-life movement than John Kasich ).That doesn t sound like a moderate at all to me. In fact, it sounds like Ted Cruz part deux, only even more dangerous, because nobody knows what he s really like. Kasich s campaign is built upon trying to make him seem like one of the sane GOP candidates, when, in actuality, he s just as crazy as the rest.

Noting that the Senate Republicans have a constitutional duty to vote on a nominee, Obama followed it with the ever-so-appropriate hashtag #DoYourJob and urged his 70 million+ followers to put pressure on the GOP to do the right thing.TwitterAlthough Obama has yet to select a nominee, the president has said that he will, and hopefully by then this awful back-and-forth with the GOP will have come to an end.

A very valid question, and one that our intelligence community probably grapples with daily considering, no, you can t torture people to gather intelligence.When posed with this question on CNN, Ben Carson replied that he would promote a much more humane  medical way  of intelligence gathering.Pressed on what this medical way would be by CNN s Poppy Harlow, Carson responded: I believe there are a number of ways to extract information. Including, you know, some medical ways of, you know, putting people into a less than conscious state which allows information to be extracted much more humanely. Carson was then asked to explain further, so he said: Well, the average person might understand it as truth serum. But, you know, there are ways where you decrease a person s conscious defenses and they might be much more willing to give up information. Seemingly perplexed by the concept of a truth serum as though it were coming from a Harry Potter novel, Harlow again asked Carson to explain in greater detail what he means. Carson explained: Sodium amytal, but you know there are a variety of different things we can use now. We ve made some advances in that kind of science. So, instead of torture people, Carson is advocating drugging them against their will. It may seem more humane, but it s not necessarily more ethical.Carson never did actually answer the question regarding if waterboarding should be used, and pivoted away into a non-answer of  I don t think we necessarily need to be broadcasting what we do.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Republicans claim to love our military veterans, but their decisions not only contradict that claim, it s killing the men and women they sent to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan.Veteran suicide is on the rise as GOP lawmakers sit on their hands to make sure nothing is done about it.In 2012, veteran suicides actually exceeded the number of troops kill in combat. According to The Guardian,  349 service members took their own lives in 2012, while a lesser number, 295, died in combat. Yet all Republicans focused on was making sure President Obama could not sign any bills that could accomplish something. And so it has remained that way even as President Obama enters his final year in office. And veterans are still committing suicide at a horrifying rate.The National Veterans Foundation reports that 22 veterans take their own lives every day and that is 22 too many.But Republican lawmakers have only made things worse for veterans over the years, creating a sense of hopelessness that makes it more likely that veteran suicides will continue even as those same Republicans use veterans as a political tool.While Republicans take the stage to blabber about how much they love the military and how much they care about the men and women who return home from combat, their actions in Congress tell a completely different story.Just this past October, Senate Republicans passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill which cut $857 million from programs that benefit veterans, but had no problem increasing funding for missile programsIn April 2015, President Obama actually had to threaten the GOP with a veto after House Republicans attempted to cut benefits for 70,000 veterans, which included money for education, prosthetic research, and veteran s cemeteries. Overall, the cuts amounted to $1.4 billion. The Veteran s Affairs Funding Bill of 2015 really should have been called the  Screw You, Veterans Bill of 2015. Other pieces of legislation offered by Democrats that would have provided much needed aid to veterans across the country have been killed by Republicans over the years, including the Women Veterans and Families Health Services Act, which would have helped veterans and their spouses seek counseling and fertility treatments.Another veterans bill that was killed by Republicans was offered up by Senator Bernie Sanders in 2014 that would have expanded healthcare and education funding for veterans. But the GOP blocked the bill by attaching sanctions on Iran to it. This is perhaps the most egregious block of any veterans bill since Reuters reported at the time that it would have created 27 new veterans hospitals to deal with the increased load of wounded veterans coming back from war. These hospitals could help prevent suicides because it would cut down on the wait times veterans are dealing with and give them hope that Congress actually cares about them.Remember the Veterans Job Corps Act of 2012? Republicans don t. Because they blocked the bill and never gave it a second thought even though it would have provided jobs to more than 20,000 veterans to help improve their own communities.Republicans also killed a bill way back in 2010 that would have helped homeless veterans, including those with children.And amazingly, that s not all Republicans have done to make the lives of veterans and their families a living hell.For years, Republicans have been viciously attacking the SNAP program, which provides food aid to millions of Americans. Republicans would have you believe that all of these food stamp recipients are freeloaders who don t want to work. But that is hardly the case. Not only do most food stamp recipients have jobs, albeit low paying jobs, 1.7 million veterans and their families rely on the program. So not only are Republicans refusing to help veterans, they are slashing a program that veterans rely on because Republicans refuse to help them.And Republicans have even slashed mental health funding by cutting grants that help states keep a mental health programs in place. Suicidal veterans NEED a strong mental health system most of all, yet the GOP has severely weakened the system for years.With treatment like that from their own government, it s no wonder that veterans are committing suicide. They have no support from Congress and what little support system they do have is being ruthlessly chipped away by Republicans who gleefully use veterans as pawns to improve their political image only to then stab them in the back when they have no further use for them.Imagine if we actually passed all of these bills to help our veterans instead of passing funding for more war. With better education opportunities and much needed mental and physical healthcare and jobs, veterans would not only feel cared about, they would be cared for and not made to feel like a burden. We could reduce the number of veteran suicides in this country.It s an epidemic that must be brought to end and we can start by firing lawmakers who only pretend to love veterans. After all, veterans fought for us. It s time for us to fight for them.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Instead, they will spend the next 340 days with an empty seat on the Supreme Court   a glowing middle finger neon sign built in the way of the democratic process.For their part, the American people have made it absolutely clear that this sort of political point scoring is inappropriate, offensive, and unwanted. When Fox News (Fox News!) ran a poll asking if Americans supported Obama naming a new justice, an overwhelming majority said yes.Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s recent death has sparked a debate over how to fill the vacancy on the nation s highest court.

In other words, there are many people that may disagree with the president on issues, but recognize the fact that he is within his rights to name a new Supreme Court Justice.Republicans just don t care.Days after the polls began trickling in saying Americans wanted Obama to be able to fulfill his obligations, McConnell and other Republican leaders held a secret, closed door meeting in his office to decide what to do. Their conclusion was to circle the wagons, dig in and stick their heads in the sand. The Party of No is alive and well.Key Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee emerged from a closed door meeting in Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s office Tuesday united in their determination not to consider any nominee to replace Anton Scalia until the next president takes office.

John Cornryn would invoke the  American people  in his disgusting defense of the GOP s actions, because the American people already had a voice when it came to the process   they voted for President Obama.

Basically, O Reilly told Carson  it would take a miracle. Even after an embarrassing loss in the South Carolina primary on Saturday, Carson couldn t come to terms that his campaign was over. He not only told his supporters that he had just as many delegates as the other candidates (aside from the winner, of course), but continued to keep up this act with O Reilly.While trying to convince O Reilly (and possibly himself) that with just  one more point  he would have come in third, O Reilly got fed up with Carson s denial tactics and decided to give him the cold, hard truth. He said: You know me, I m a fairly straight forward guy. It would take a miracle for not only you but John Kasich, at this point, with the delegate situation being what it is, to overcome Trump. While O Reilly still felt there might be hope that Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) could give Trump a run for his money, O Reilly said to Carson, But for you. Very difficult. It was like O Reilly was speaking to a wall, because Carson continued to believe  a lot of things can happen  and that with only five GOP candidates now, he could be more successful when America focuses on the issues over  personalities. O Reilly kept taking Carson off cloud nine and putting him back into reality, where it was becoming clear that Carson should soon be dropping out of the presidential race. Noting that March 1st was a crucial date for Carson, O Reilly said: You know, doc, I gotta tell ya, I just don t think you re gonna do it. It s not you. It s history. It s almost like Governor Bush in a sense that it was just the wrong time for Governor Bush up against the colossus. Carson reluctantly agreed with O Reilly, but mentioned that Bill Clinton didn t emerge as a success until after the sixth contest   and O Reilly shut him down once again. It became clear that O Reilly already thinks Carson s campaign is over when he asked Carson who he d be endorsing after he drops out.

In fact, Carson s gone so far as to allude to the fact that actually he would be the real first black president, because Obama was  raised white,  and that Obama doesn t actually understand what it s like to be black.He told the Politico podcast: He s an  African  American.

I know that. I haven t experienced that. So, because he hasn t experienced it. Well, then, it must not exist. Right?It s as though he believes he s the be all and end all in the discussion of racism.

He is going to close Guantanamo Bay.There is not doubt that Guantanamo has become a stain on the American flag, and a matter of national shame. As Obama put it: Our closest allies raise it with me continuously.  The creation of an extra-judicial prison, in which human beings are trapped and tortured, outside of all laws covering nations and war is a chapter of U.S. history that every American should relish closing. This should not be a partisan issue. It should be a matter of conscience. If America is to pride itself as a nation of laws, it cannot operate outside of those laws.Barack Obama s criticisms of the War on Terror and his commitment to close Guantanamo formed a central promise of his election to the White House in 2008. Sadly, many of the dreams remained unfulfilled. Drone strikes not only continued, but escalated. The U.S continued to intervene in matters of regime change, from Ukraine to Syria. This left the world with two possible conclusion to draw:Both those options left America, and the world, in a very uncertain era. Either, there is no politician we can trust to lead the nation in a just and honorable manner. Or, even if there is, that person will be unable to effect the change we seek. Both of these issue are a crisis for U.S. democracy and the international community.But Obama s announcement today could well signal shift in U.S. policy at home and abroad ahead of the next (likely Democrat) Presidency.

But the Pentagon and the White House are keen that this is a plan that must be agreed and delivered across the aisles and branches of government. A press release from the Defense Department, stipulates that the plan  does not endorse a specific facility to house Guantanamo detainees who cannot be safely transferred to other countries at this time. The administration seeks an active dialogue with Congress on this issue and looks forward to working with Congress to identify the most appropriate location as soon as possible. In concluding his hour-long review of the plans, and President was unambiguous in his views, stating simply: This plan has my full support. The Pentagon is behind the plan, the President is behind the plan.

This year s letter was all about energy, how we consume it, how we create it, and how climate change should be the number one issue for us all. Now that the Republican Party has tied itself to the oil industry-funded climate change denial, they could have alienated themselves from a generation who can save humanity from itself. The GOP has become, literally, the only political party in the developed world to endorse the scientifically-bogus denial of climate change.As Business Insider reports:The basic premise of the letter is that many people around the world still don t have access to electricity. Those people   about 18% of the world s population   deserve access to cheap, clean energy. And that  clean  part is very important: We need to get carbon dioxide emissions, which drive climate change, down to zero by the end of the century, in order to avoid dramatic, long-term changes to the world s climate.While achieving this goal will require an energy miracle, Gates calls on Highschoolers to get involved in making that miracle happen   because it is these lofty aspirations that distinguish human beings from their fellow animals. He writes:When I say  miracle,  I don t mean something that s impossible. I ve seen miracles happen before. The personal computer. The Internet. The polio vaccine. None of them happened by chance. They are the result of research and development and the human capacity to innovate.In this case, however, time is not on our side. Every day we are releasing more and more CO2 into our atmosphere and making our climate change problem even worse. We need a massive amount of research into thousands of new ideas even ones that might sound a little crazy if we want to get to zero emissions by the end of this century.This is the message and the attitude that speaks to the Manifest Destiny of America.

With realistic looking microphones and presumably cameramen, they capture the beauty and simplicity of the wild American  patriot.  The way they see it they re some kind of dying breed coming together as a movement. The way we see it is a dangerous bunch of people who will believe anything you tell them rallying behind lunatics and narcissistic billionaires.Dangerous is the key word. Godwin saw Donald Trump coming. Godwin s law says all internet disputes eventually end at Nazi, and he who goes there first loses. What else can you possibly equate to Donald Trump s rise to power besides 1936? People are thrilled to be able to hate so openly. Millions of people. They want someone loud and aggressive who will  rebuild our military,  as Trump orders the best of the best of the best for our troops. If you re white, full of rage, rich, or just plain dumb, a Donald Trump presidency is a dream come true. It wouldn t take that idiot but a month to destroy our respect as a country and our economy.That makes people who support Donald Trump fair game. This bit of trickery goes quite a bit further, however, when one of the Fox girls gets a hold of Rick Santorum and asks him about Trump s plan to sterilize Puerto Ricans. Santorum is NOT in favor of sterilizing anyone at this time. The fact that he takes it seriously is comedy gold. Senator Rand Paul gets the same story and says the most intelligent thing of anyone on the entire clip:  I think that s the dumbest thing I ve ever heard. The bonus at the end is just too much.

These loans have an annual interest rate of 279 percent.According to WTVF, the Flex loan is the brainchild of the payday loan industry. The bill, which allows payday lenders to push these predatory loans in Tennessee, was introduced just as the U.S. Congress was talking about cracking down on traditional payday loans.The Flexible Credit Act, which created the loans and legalized an interest rate of 279 percent, was sponsored by republican State Representative Cameron Sexton.It passed with bipartisan support in both houses.An investigation by WTVF revealed that, just before and just after the bill was passed, at least $400,000 was funnelled to state lawmakers from payday lending companies.The only person to testify regarding the bill was a lobbyist from the payday loan industry.Only one lawmaker, democratic Representative Mike Stewart, questioned the legislation as it made its way through the assembly.Video shows that Representative Stewart, who voted against the legislation, initially asked Sexton about the bill. Do we have any idea as we re passing this bill today, which is creating an entirely new financial product, what it s going to cost the average guy on the street? When Sexton did not have an immediate answer, Stewart continued to press him on the issue. Well what is the APR?  he asked.  I m sure we know it. What is it? What is the answer? What is it? Sexton finally replied, saying,  The highest interest rate that could be charged is 24%. Sexton s answer was deceptive. While Flex loans have a 24 percent annual interest rate, there is an additional interest rate of .7 percent, which is charged to the consumer every single day, throughout the life of the loan.Veteran Joshua Hause had two existing payday loans in Tennessee, before the Flex loans were legalized. His total debt at the time was $925.As he explains here, he was forced to convert the two loans to a Flex loan. He now pays more than $2,000 a month on the $925 he originally borrowed, and his payments continue to grow larger every month.Hause is not alone. WTVF also talked to Tennessee resident Malia Andrews. I just about had a complete meltdown in the car,  Andrews recalled, describing the moment she realized it would take years to pay off her flex loan.She explained,  And only like $20 of my payment was going to the principal and the rest was, like $300, was going towards the interest rate. The single mother said that, if she d known how much the loan would end up costing her, she never would have taken it out. According to WTVF, the bill that legalized Flex loans in Tennessee never addressed the 279 percent APR.WTVF interviewed Sexton on February 17, 2016.NewsChannel 5 Investigates asked Sexton about the exchange on the House floor in 2014:  Why weren t you able to just say  this is what the APR is ? Sexton s response:  I don t think anybody was trying to dodge the question. What happens is you want to make sure the information he s provided is accurate. It gets better.NewsChannel 5 Investigates asked Sexton,  So you d have to do some real math to figure out its 279%. I don t know about real math, but it would take a little work to come up with 278%,  he replied.

As  you make your way up 195,  a short hop across I-295 brings you into Portland, where sprawling hills are covered with multi-family dwellings.. Historical landmarks, cemeteries with stones dating back to the American Revolution and old, massive churches intermingle with the modern amenities of city life; a minor league baseball complex and a bustling downtown full of hipster bars and food trucks.It s a pleasant mix of New England quaint meets the rise of the millennials. Maine is one of those misunderstood states because of the rural nature and low population. People think of the rural redneck, pick- em-up truck driving, hick wearing flannel and hunting moose all day for fun. Sure, they exist, by the gross ton. There also exists an urban culture of liberalism that can sometimes take a wrong turn.San Francisco is a great example. A city that prides itself on being liberal just spent more than a million dollars to hide their homeless problem from Super Bowl fans. Rents in the city have increased so much that the middle class can barely survive. Portland, Maine may never be San Fransisco, but it does have some similarly disturbing issues.On the front page of the Portland Press Herald today is a story of a couple dozen residents of an apartment complex in the city. Many of the residents are elderly or disabled and on public assistance. The complex was purchased by a private investment firm, most likely for its aged appearance and high ceilings, something very trendy in urban centers of the northeast. With no current leases left to contend with, the owners of the building just said,  sorry, get out. The units, which were renting at $800 per month and affordable to low-income and disabled people, will probably become buildings full of $300K one and two bedroom condos with re-finished wood floors, cheap granite countertops and stainless steel appliances with great access to the city, public transportation and the food truck district known as the Old Port. The next logical step for most of these people would be to seek housing in Biddeford or Lewiston, the next most likely places to find low-income housing, as Portland is going the way of the latte  and $12 mac and cheese.And yet again the wealthy will succeed in winning yet another battle against the poor. With no real protections in place for this kind of thing, people who are less fortunate take the fall as the ones who need to  move on  and  take personal responsibility.  Imagine for a moment you work a job, the only one you can find, that is in the city you barely squeak by living in, within a few blocks of a public bus route. The next thing you know you have nowhere to stay, you can t shower or wash clothes to go to your job, you have no car and the closest affordable place to live is 30 miles away.What do you do? These are real-life situations that are happening to people who in many cases can t take proper care of themselves. And yes, as a society it is our responsibility to take care of those who can t take care of themselves. Deal with it. You can t let people starve and you can t let them die of exposure because they didn t have a warm place to spend the night.Portland, Maine is a great little city. All hope isn t lost. But when this kind of thing happens and goes unchecked to the point that it s front page news, things are spiraling out of control.

Proof of this can be found in  Triumph the Insult Comic Dog s Ben Carson Social Experiment.

Considering that Rafael is Ted s campaign surrogate and a religious man, this of course meant some fear-mongering and crazy Christianity references similar to the time he claimed that God was raising up Ted to be the next POTUS.This time, the elder Cruz was on a real mission to convince America that God is behind his son s candidacy and will make sure that he wins the election.

Believers are coalescing around Ted Cruz and I think when the people of God realize that we need a man of faith, a man of integrity, a man that you can trust his word   two things you can count on Ted Cruz, number one he will tell you the truth, and number two, he will do exactly what he says he s going to do. That Rafael called his son a  man of truth  is hilarious, as Cruz was just slammed in the media for spreading false information about Marco Rubio. Rafael also boasted about his son s ability to be the most outspoken homophobe running for president. Rafael reference the Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality, proudly stating that his son was the only candidate who said the ruling was  not the law of the land, this is an unconstitutional, unlawful decision and five justices have no right to impose their view upon 320 million Americans.

However, so many  small government  conservatives have absolutely no problem inserting themselves into the health and well-being of women put into situations where they and their doctors should be the only ones discussing what s best for them. Attacking this issue head-on is Last Week Tonight host, John Oliver.Oliver led into the segment saying that he wanted to talk about breast implants, saying: Some are against them, others believe they are fine in rare cases and some think you should be able to get them whenever the f  you want. Oh did I say breast implants? I meant abortion. It was then that Oliver delivered the most severe beat down of conservative restrictive policies on abortion likely ever witnessed on television. It may actually leave you not only angry, but in tears over how horrific so many of these restrictions are.According to TIME: A new Gallup poll revealed that 19% of Americans think abortion should be completely illegal, while 36% think it should be allowed in some cases and 29% think it should be allowed on demand. Despite the fact that abortion is legal in the United States, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court s decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, there has been an increase in state regulation of abortion clinics, resulting in a decrease in clinics in some states. North Dakota, South Dakota, Mississippi and Utah now only have one clinic per state. Oliver s reaction to that is: Yes, Mississippi now has four times as many esses as it has abortion clinics. These laws are not only restrictive, they are outright dangerous. There are several cases of women and girls absolutely needed to get an abortion, and when those services are denied because some holier than thou zealots in government think that their way should be the only way, these women and girls will get hurt. Not only physically, but emotionally.It is outright infuriating to think about young girls being forced to give birth to their rapist s baby. And if you are in the 19% that thinks these restrictive laws are okay, John Oliver, as well as the rest of everyone who is humane and decent, has a question for you: What the fuck is wrong with you?!

This tape is exactly the opposite of what they needed.As The Wrap noted, the discussions, taken during commercial breaks, center around ensuring Trump is okay with certain questions. Brzezinski can be heard asking Trump if he wants her to skip over a tricky deportation question entirely: Do you not want me to do, the um, the ones with, um, deportation? We really do have to go to some questions,  Scarborough responds before Trump chimes in with,  Nothing too hard, Mika. Brzezinski can be heard saying,  OK,  directly after Trump s remark. The Town Hall never featured a question about deportation. Shearer says the audio came from his  found objects department  and jokes you can cut the adversarial tension there with a knife. A butter knife, but still. At one point, Brzezinski tells Trump she thought he didn t have a great debate performance. Yay! But then Scarborough butts in by assuring Trump  We were wrong.  Wait what?

Plus, state and federal funding is not used by Planned Parenthood to pay for abortion.What state and federal funds are used for, however, are crucial medical services that women will no longer have access to because Republicans don t care about collateral damage in their war on a woman s right to choose.According to Huffington Post, Planned Parenthood is about to lose $1.3 million that would have been spent on  HIV testing, cancer screenings and programs that help prevent domestic violence and infant mortality. This isn t even the first time Kasich has attacked women s health since becoming governor.He has also signed bills banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, banning public hospitals from accepting transfer patients from clinics, and stripping rape crisis centers from funding if they refer patients to an abortion provider.As for the current bill Kasich signed, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards denounced it and the man who signed it. John Kasich is proudly eliminating care for expectant mothers and newborns; he is leaving thousands without vital STD and HIV testing, slashing a program to fight domestic violence, and cutting access to essential, basic health care. It s clear Kasich has no regard for women s health or lives, and will stop at nothing to block health care for the tens of thousands of Ohioans who rely on Planned Parenthood. And Kasich signed this bill, now one of the most extreme anti-women laws in the nation, as he parades across the country trying to convince everyone, especially women, that he is a  moderate  Republican deserving of their support in his bid to become President of the United States, a position he would absolutely use to ban abortion entirely and eliminate Planned Parenthood.Kasich is not a moderate.

That means the financial analyst would probably be paying more in taxes should Sanders win the White House and get some of his proposals passed. Varney argues against Sanders  proposals to make taxes a bit more progressive to address skyrocketing income inequality, saying  You re going to take it off me and give it to somebody else. I got it. Okay. Bilbray defends her position. However, Varney wasn t hearing it. Let s not beat around the bush,  Varney goes on to say.  He is going to take it off me.

Sanders has revealed himself to have a humanist philosophy on morality. Sanders also happens to have a lot of respected economists who agree with his tax policy proposals too. Sanders recently explained his spirituality, saying: I believe that, as a human being, the pain that one person feels, if we have children who are hungry in America, if we have elderly people who can t afford their prescription drugs, you know what, that impacts you, that impacts me. And I worry very much about a society where some people spiritually say,  It doesn t matter to me. I got it, I don t care about other people.

In 2004, his life was spared just hours before he was supposed to be executed. But now, more than a decade later, in a matter of weeks,  he is once again facing lethal injection and even a federal judge agrees that he may be innocent.In 1983, Cooper escaped a maximum security prison and was holed up in an abandoned house hiding from authorities. While he was hiding out in the house, two adults and two small children, just a short distance away in the Chino Hills suburb of Los Angeles were being murdered. When police found the bodies of Douglas and Peggy Ryen, their 10-year-old daughter Jessica, and 10-year-old Chris Hughes they zeroed in on Cooper as the suspect. He was eventually convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death despite an overwhelming amount of evidence that he did not commit the murders.There was one survivor, a then 8-year-old Josh Ryen who had his throat cut and was left for dead. When Josh Ryen recovered from his injuries, he stated that it was three white or Hispanic men that attacked and killed his family and that Cooper was not involved. This started a chain of events that reveal a 30 year cover up and blatant falsification of evidence by police and the prosecutor s office in San Bernadino County.In addition to the child s statement (which he later changed), there was another suspect. When the Ryens were murdered, their station wagon was stolen and witnesses reported that they d seen three men in a vehicle matching its description near the crime. Furthermore, the ex-wife of a white supremacist (Lee Furrow) told the police that her ex had come home wearing bloody pants after the murder. She also said that a hatchet was missing from her home. She gave the police the pants and they never tested them for DNA. Finally, police also found the blood of two other people who did not match Cooper or the victims at the crime scene.Cooper appealed his conviction and although the Ninth Circuit Court upheld the conviction, five federal judges wrote a 103-page dissent, saying: There is no way to say this politely. The district court failed to provide Cooper a fair hearing. The district court impeded and obstructed Cooper s attorneys at every turn. [T]he court imposed unreasonable conditions, refused discovery that should have been available as a matter of course; limited testimony that should not have been limited; and found facts unreasonably, based on a truncated and distorted record. Public confidence in the proper administration of the death penalty depends on the integrity of the process followed by the state  So far as due process is concerned, twenty-four years of flawed proceedings are as good as no proceedings at all. the State of California may be about to execute an innocent man. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case and that means that his conviction has been upheld. Now, Cooper is just weeks away from execution, he will be the first person in the state to be executed in the state since 2006 if Governor Jerry Brown does not grant him a stay.It is unprecedented to have five federal judges warn that an innocent man may be executed. Frankly, in a case like this that should be all that is needed for a new trial, at the very least.The death penalty is controversial in this country. It is one of those things that even liberals are split on. But whether you are pro- or anti-capital punishment I think we can all agree that if there is the slightest chance that someone may be innocent, the state should not be killing them. And I am saying this to you as a person whose father was violently murdered. Governor Jerry Brown needs to halt this execution. If this man is put to death when there is so much evidence pointing to his innocence, our entire judicial system will be invalidated.Featured image via Save Innocents""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And while Cummings does give them some credit for called Snyder before the Committee in March, it is clear that they are not going after Snyder with the same vigor. Cummings wrote: During our meeting last week, you explained that you had spoken directly with Governor Snyder, and you suggested that one reason not to request documents from him is because he might claim that his communications about the Flint water crisis are protected by executive privilege. Although I was not a part of your conversation with Governor Snyder, any claim of executive privilege to withhold documents from Congress would be a surprising turn of events that directly contradicts the Governor s own promises of accountability to the people of Michigan. Cummings also wrote: I believe that the Committee should apply the same standards for requesting documents to all governors, regardless of whether they are Democrats or Republicans. By declining to send any document request at all to Governor Snyder, the Committee is creating the perception of a double-standard in which it has requested documents from a Democratic governor, but not from a Republican governor. He then goes on to give the example of former Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber.It is simply woefully irresponsible to so blatantly neglect going after Gov. Snyder, especially considering the Flint, Michigan water crisis is so irreversibly severe causing lifelong health issues to those affected. Not only should they be investigating Snyder to the fullest extent, but they should be pushing for his resignation, as is what happened with Kitzhaber.Cummings sums it up best when he states: The Committee has never accepted this practice as an adequate standard of investigation, and we should not do so now. Governor Snyder and his staff are central figures in the decision-making process that led to the poisoning of Flint residents, and the Committee owes it to these residents to conduct a comprehensive and bipartisan investigation. Snyder needs to be held responsible and party politics need to be checked at the door. End of story.Featured image via YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The penalties are tougher, but the way they maintain the supervision is stricter as well.

As the court evolved over the years, participation from the justices, specifically in the form of questions for petitioners, became a regular part of the system.

Still, something doesn t sit right with a justice who hasn t asked a question from the bench in exactly one decade.There is some speculation that Thomas is self-conscious about his Georgia accent. He has also admitted that he doesn t like to compete with the louder voices on the court. There was no louder voice than Antonin Scalia. Scalia never missed the opportunity to ask a question he felt needed answering. He may very well be the reason why Clarence Thomas went into super secret quiet mode, chatting small talk with fellow justices only and cracking a joke once a few years ago. The last time he asked a question was on a death penalty case in 2006.Scalia covered what Clarence Thomas needed to hear. Their voting records nearly identical, the well-known Thomas written opinion is nothing but a mirror of what had already been spoken in open court. So what will Clarence Thomas do without Antonin Scalia?

In response, Gingrich pointed out that it was Fox News that created the Trump candidacy in the first place. That s because of you guys.

Indeed, former Republican candidate Jeb Bush raised and spent millions of dollars but never could take down Trump, eventually dropping out after the South Carolina primary because of that failure.Trump, on the other hand, has been all over the media getting free coverage.

We just got an army of people, and many women who left their kitchens to go out and go door-to-door and to put yard signs up for me.

And due to the fact that no federal money goes to abortions in the first place, the budget cuts won t affect abortions, they ll affect everything else. Just one more way Kasich and his party have found to cause damage to women s health as part of their fanatical quest to take down Planned Parenthood.Ironically, Kasich has promoted himself as the moderate choice for the Republican Party. He s repeatedly argued that America should vote for him over the likes of Trump and Rubio because he isn t (quite) as crazy. With his views of women s role in the home (in the kitchen, of course!) and his quest to make it harder for them to receive health care, it s becoming a laughable premise.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""On January 23, 2016, 45-year-old Rex Orval Iverson died in a Box Elder County, Utah jail cell. His only crime was that he had failed to pay a $2,400 ambulance bill.According to his obituary, Mr. Iverson was not a deadbeat. Instead, he was a hardworking man, who took great pride in his accomplishments. Like most people, he held many different jobs throughout his lifetime, but according to his family, No matter what he was doing he always made the best of it. He worked for Peter Kiewit Construction as a heavy equipment operator in Denver, Colorado where he worked on the Trex project. He loved coming home and showing us pictures of what he had done and he took great pride in being able to work on such a big project. His employment with Kiewit Construction allowed him to travel to different states working on the roads. According to Chrissy Sabala, who described him as someone who was  like a brother,  Mr. Iverson s parents were both killed in a car accident.Sabala told the Standard Examiner He quit living when his parents died. Life stood still for him. Sabala says that Iverson continued to live in his parents  home, following their deaths.She described someone who was clearly experiencing PTSD, along with other possible mental health problems, saying  Everything in that house he left exactly like his mother had left it. Mr. Iverson was no longer employed, but Sabala says that he did what he could to help everyone, whether tilling a neighbor s garden or giving of the little he had, in order to help a friend in need.Sabala said that he gave her his beloved Harley-Davidson when she fell on hard financial times.She also stressed that He just didn t have any money,  adding,  When those people died, his life stopped. On Christmas Eve of 2013, because of an undisclosed illness or injury, an ambulance was called to Iverson s home.He later received a bill for $2,400.It was a bill he could not pay.He was sued by the city of Tremonton, which won a small claims judgement against him, after he failed to show up for court.Under Utah law, a person can be jailed for failure to pay a debt, including a medical debt.So if you get sick in Utah and you need medical care, you can be arrested if you can t pay for it.That s what happened to Mr. Iverson.He was arrested for failure to pay his medical debts on January 23. He died in the Box Elder County Jail later the same day.The Northern Utah Critical Incident Investigative Team is investigating Mr. Iverson s death.According to the Standard Examiner, during the 2014-15 fiscal year, the city of Tremonton alone processed 122 civil cases for unpaid debt in Utah s  justice courts. More than half of the judges that hear civil cases regarding unpaid debts in the state do not even have a law degree.In order to become a judge in a Utah  justice court,  all you need is a high school diploma.The Standard Examiner reports that these Justice Court judges hear the majority of cases in the state.Defendants in these courts often have little understanding of the law, and no access to an attorney.Yet, in these courts, a judge with a high school diploma can sentence a person to jail for failing to pay an ambulance bill.Debtors prisons have been illegal in United States for more than 200 years. But that has not kept judges from sending people to jail for being poor.More than 30 years ago the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ban on debtor s prisons, ruling that judges can t send a person to jail simply because he or she is unable to pay a debt. But a loophole in the ruling allows people to be jailed if a judge determines they  willfully  refuse to pay.But as Think Progress reports here, more people are being imprisoned for unpaid debts than ever before in the United States, in part because of the tactics used by dishonest collection agencies, and in part because judges are not informed about debtor s rights.It s one thing to put someone in jail who willfully ran up credit card debt, and later refused to pay for it. But people who engage in this kind of behavior are often protected by bankruptcy laws.When cities make it a priority to arrest and incarcerate people like Rex Iverson, who simply could not pay an ambulance bill, that s something else altogether.At this time, the cause of Mr. Iverson s death has not been made public. Regardless of what caused his death, this man should not have died alone in a jail cell, where he was imprisoned for the crime of needing an ambulance he could not pay for.Image credit: rogersandtaylor.com, Rex Orval Iverson obituary photo""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The trial, in U.S. district court in Richmond, Virginia, is one of several voting rights legal battles in process as Democrats and Republicans square off ahead of November s presidential election.The Democratic Party of Virginia and two party activists are suing the Virginia State Board of Elections and want Judge Henry Hudson to strike down the law.The problem for the right is that the premise behind these laws has always been a lie. Republicans only became  concerned  with  voter fraud  when it became clear that their white hegemony was in immediate danger. Adding to this problem was the over-the-top way Republicans attacked people s ability to vote. If Voter ID had been a stand alone law, then Republicans MIGHT have been able to maintain the fiction that it was just about voter fraud. However, they also cut voting hours, the number of polling places (but only in Democratic-leaning areas), made the IDs difficult to get and, of course, kept bragging about how it would hurt the Democrats.And just to be absolutely clear that Voter ID laws are bullshit, here s my favorite quote from the New York Times (4/12/2007):Five years after the Bush administration began a crackdown on voter fraud, the Justice Department has turned up virtually no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections, according to court records and interviews.Although Republican activists have repeatedly said fraud is so widespread that it has corrupted the political process and, possibly, cost the party election victories, about 120 people have been charged and 86 convicted as of last year.Widespread voter fraud does not exist.The only way for a court to uphold Voter ID is to willfully turn a blind eye to the glaring pattern of voter suppression Republicans have openly laid out. If you re wondering why they were so brazen, it s because they were quite confidant that the Supreme Court would back their partisan attack on democracy. After all, they gutted the Voting Rights Act by claiming, in all seriousness, that racism in America was over and keeping (mostly southern) states from blocking minorities from voting wasn t necessary. Southern states immediately responded by passing laws blocking minorities from voting.Now that Republicans no longer have a friendly SCOTUS to allow their shenanigans, the number of lawsuits against Voter ID and the laundry list of voter suppression tactics is going to grow. According to Yahoo, Kansas and North Carolina s ID laws are also under fire.

Oliver noted that both nominees failed to be confirmed and surmised that that s what Ted Cruz must have been thinking of when he tweaked his previous claim by saying that for 80 years the Senate has not confirmed a nominee nominated in an election year.And once again, Ted Cruz was proved wrong.

We should let President Obama do his job, Oliver said.And then he totally lampooned the Judicial Crisis Network with an ad of his own using the same kind of stock footage to make the case.Here s the video via YouTube:Once again, John Oliver puts Republicans in their place by demolishing their excuses for refusing to hold confirmation hearings for any nominee President Obama puts forward to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

There were 21 present to support Hillary Clinton.According to caucus rules, only people who are actually present are supposed to be included in the final tally.Yet after the official count was taken, Linden was stunned to see officials adding ballots to the count, from people who were not there.Suddenly, to everyone s surprise, the count on Hillary Clinton s side began to rise.Another caucus-goer, Rhiannon Frauenfeld, confirmed that this is exactly what happened.Frauenfeld told Addicting Info:With the paper ballots of absentee people included, it was 42/31 Bernie still leading.

Pope Francis  humble nature and openness to the world has the world humming with gratitude for a return to solemnity within the Vatican walls, so wherever he goes, massive crowds follow who want to meet him, or if anything, merely catch a glimpse.However, it looks as though one person became too eager and failed to recognize others around them in their own selfish desire to come into contact with the Pontiff.According to Inside Edition: In a rare sight of public agitation, Pope Francis lost his composure as he greeted a crowd of worshippers in Morella, Mexico. When a devotee grabbed him by his cassock and wouldn t let go, it caused the Pontiff to fall into a wheelchair-bound man. The Pope sternly told the man in Spanish  don t be selfish.  Pope Francis recovered and kissed the man on the head following the incident. He waved to people in the open-air gathering for a few more minutes after the incident before leaving. Pope Francis was exactly right to get mad at what this person was doing to him and made him do to another. They were being selfish and needed to be told that what they were doing was unacceptable. And as far as the Pope showing he was upset, that s more than okay, too. Heck, even Jesus tossed a few tables in anger back in his day.This is more than just a soundbite for a story, but a lesson in life. You may want something for yourself, but always respect and think of others who may get hurt if your quest for selfish glory.

Even Marco Rubio is being painted as an atheist.While Donald Trump maintains a huge lead over his competitors, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are shooting for second place   and things are getting nastier by the minute. In a particularly egregious   albeit not surprising   bit of mudslinging, Cruz s campaign spread an outrageous video they claimed showed Rubio telling a Cruz campaign staffer that he hated the Bible. That s right, Marco  I could look a rape victim in the eye and tell them not to have an abortion  Rubio hates God. Or so Cruz s team would have you believe.The video, released by the right-leaning politics section of the The Daily Pennsylvania, captures a candid moment between Rubio and one of Cruz s campaign staffers named Christian Collins. Rubio walks by Collins, seated next to Cruz s (batshit insane) father, Rafael Cruz, and reportedly pointed to a bible Collins was reading, telling him  Not many answers in it.  The Daily Pennsylvania even helpfully provides captions for this exchange so you can comfortably ignore the fact that this was absolutely not what Rubio said.Many news outlets ran the story without even a hint of skepticism. Gawker framed it as Marco Rubio  trying to talk smack.  But if you listen to the audio and ignore what the captions are telling you Rubio is saying, the conversation seems much less hostile. In fact, Rubio appears to be trying to bond with the Cruz staffer over their shared love of the Bible.Listening to just the audio, Rubio clearly says: Got a good book there? Every answer is in there. Especially in that one. That interpretation would make sense because Marco Rubio is a religious fundamentalist who, like many Republicans, believes God has ordained him to become president. His stance on things like gay marriage and abortion are derived from his literalist reading of the Bible. He really believes that  every answer is in there.  The idea that Rubio decided to out himself as an atheist to a random Cruz staffer and Cruz s dad, thereby effectively ending his own campaign, is so ludicrous that only a particularly dim Cruz fan would be gullible enough to actually buy it.Many of them did. Some with a splash of anti-Catholic bigotry.Despite the logical leaps, Cruz s campaign limply tried to spread this rumor as well. Why waste the moment, right? It was painful to watch. Here s Rick Tyler, a Cruz staffer, tweeting a link to the  Rubio hates God  story.What better way to shed that stigma of running a dishonest campaign than to push a story that Rubio hates the Bible. pic.twitter.com/nVzXPFG3j0  Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) February 21, 2016Almost immediately, the  higher ups  in the Cruz campaign realized this story was a disaster in the making. They were okay when Cruz suggested Trump would abolish the Second Amendment. They were okay when Cruz told Iowans that Ben Carson had dropped out of the race on the night of the caucus. They were not okay with selling a narrative that Marco Rubio was an atheist.Cruz campaign, at the highest levels, tell me that this was a horrible media baited situation (my words). They confirm Rubio praised Bible.  Ali A. Akbar (@ali) February 21, 2016Cruz s campaign has since frantically walked back its initial jabs at Rubio, but it s clear that this represents a defining pivot for the race. Cruz, already perhaps the most underhanded candidate in modern politics, is just chomping at the bit to pounce on Rubio, his closest competitor. He is particularly interested in going after Rubio s faith, because Cruz s entire candidacy relies on appealing to the Christian Right. It s only reasonable to suspect Cruz will continue to remind his evangelical followers of Rubio s Catholicism and, if he can get away with it, his  atheism.

So it s understandable that they were disappointed when Scalia passed away before decisions could be made on these cases.But one conservative attorney in Arizona is throwing a desperation Hail Mary in an effort to make sure conservatives continue to control the Supreme Court 5-4 even though the composition of the high court is now 4-4.During a KPNX panel on the status of the Court, Kory Langhofer claimed that Justice Scalia should be allowed to cast a vote even though he is dead. There s no Ouija board required to figure out how Justice Scalia would vote on these things, he s already voted,  Langhofer claimed on Sunday. He explained that all of the Justices meet and discuss the case before one Justice goes off to write the decision. And that is why Langhofer thinks Scalia can still vote on these cases.  We re at the second-to-last step in how these cases unfold when Justice Scalia died,  he said.  We know exactly what he thought. And it s not unprincipled to say we should give affect to that. Langhofer then used an example of a US Senator dying after the Senate sends a freshly passed bill to the President after the Vice-President casts the tie-breaking vote.The problem with comparing Congress to the Supreme Court is that the senator had already cast their final vote on the bill, whereas Justice Scalia might have changed his mind anytime between discussion and writing an opinion. And that s how attorney Thomas Ryan explained it to Langhofer. Justices, after they do the conferences can also change their minds,  he pointed out.  The general rule is dead justices don t vote. I mean, that sounds cruel, but that s it. Here s the video via YouTube:But Langhofer continued to argue that Justice Scalia s conservative ideology should be used to decide cases with his opinion even after his death.Of course, if that s the case, why not continue to use long-dead Chief Justice Roger B. Taney s notes to let him vote on cases today? I m sure the author of the Dred Scott decision in 1857 would love to be able to cast votes in cases involving civil rights. After all, we know how he would vote on these things. Or how about we let former Justice Harry Blackmun, who died in 1999, vote on any upcoming abortion cases? After all, we know how he would vote on these things considering he authored the Roe v. Wade decision.112 Americans have sat on the Court. 11 of them still live, but only 8 are still active Justices. So it would be a pain in the ass to access how each of the 101 dead Justices would vote on a Supreme Court case in the present day. Only a living Justice can make a decision, and none of the cases Scalia was discussing reached a final decision because no decision is final until it is announced. Justices can and have changed their minds before at the last minute and there is no way of knowing what Scalia would have done had he still been alive, even with notes kept by the Chief Justice. And that s why dead Justices do not get a vote on the Supreme Court.This is nothing more than a ploy that conservatives are toying with to keep Scalia on the high court for the next year while Republicans block President Obama from nominating a living person to fill the empty seat. It s a dangerous slope that threatens our Constitution, which, by the way, says nothing about letting a dead judge continue to issue rulings until a new judge replaces them.The bottom line is that Scalia is dead, and while that is tragic for his friends and family, the Supreme Court must move on and that means a new Justice must takeover whether conservatives like it or not.Featured Image: Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

One Georgia lawmaker even proudly admitted the legislation would protect the Ku Klux Klan s agenda. In a letter prior to the bill s passage, Americans United for Separation of Church and state Legislative Director Maggie Garrett urged lawmakers to oppose the horrific legislation, pointing out that it would allow individuals, businesses, or even taxpayer-funded organizations to refuse services and benefits based on arbitrary objections to that person s lifestyle choices, sexual orientation, socioeconimic status, and a number of other factors: I m gay, our CFO is gay, we have people from every walk of life working here,  373K Co-founder Kelvin Williams told The New Civil Rights Movement Saturday. I ve got Muslims, Buddhists, atheists here,  he added.  We ve got great Christians working for us. They ve never thought of not serving anyone  that s not the message of Christ. We don t tolerate that crap,  Williams said, explaining that the anti-LGBT bill is  not conducive for Georgia,  where the business environment in the state is not that great anyway. It s sad our state government wants to take us back in time,  Williams said.  I wish Georgia would wake up.  He laid out the true meaning ebhind the bill, which lawmakers falsely claim will not permit discrimination: If you re not a white married Christian heterosexual, prepare to be persecuted. Williams says that his company will not do business with  fake Christians  who support the legislation.Unfortunately, the state of Georgia is about to learn a hard lesson about discrimination. Last year, businesses pulled out of Indiana after the state passed  religious freedom  legislation that also allegedly did not allow discrimination. After a pizza shot proved lawmakers  false claims wrong by acting to discriminate against gay and lesbian couples before the ink was dry on the Governor s signature, the law was swiftly changed.Good luck, Georgia.

You finished third in a state with the highest evangelical turnout that we ve seen yet. And you finished third! Cruz continued on with all the confidence of an asylum patient.

However, he never mentions that Iowa has long been considered a toss up. Literally anybody can win Iowa. Rick Santorum won Iowa.

Especially given the fact that there are white supremacist groups and individuals like that who support you, some of whom you ve even retweeted. Of course, Trump responded by claiming that he has no idea what Tapper is talking about and went on to claim in classic Trump form that African-Americans are going to come around and start flocking to his campaign. Well, that, I know nothing about. I don t now about retweeting. You retweet somebody and they turn out to be white supremacists. I know nothing about these groups that are supporting me The other thing is African-American voters, I think I m going to get a tremendous amount,  Trump opined.

This is the most highly populated area of Nevada, and the county is a must-win for presidential candidates hoping to capture their party s nomination.Earlier in the day on Wednesday, a caucus-goer by the name of James Porter uploaded a disturbing cell phone video to YouTube.Porter documented caucus leaders telling attendees to  come in to caucus without registering.  That s a direct quote.The video shows a large group of people standing at the registration table. A female official is then heard telling the group not to register to vote.Immediately after she gives this direction, a male official shushes her, saying  Don t yell it. When the officials are questioned about allowing people who are not registered to caucus, one responds by saying,  They will register after the caucus. Watch the video below.What happened after that is even more unbelievable.As reported by The Jimmy Dore Show, the caucus was total chaos from beginning to end. There doesn t seem to be any organization to this,  Dore says.The video shows the way the votes were tallied during the caucus, with the unnamed official taking a cursory head count. The video then shows the leader of the caucus writing stuff on his hand.No official report was given regarding the head count, or the number of voters caucusing for either candidate.It was then announced that: As of today s caucus results, Senator Sanders has gained seven delegates  Secretary Clinton has   oh, I m sorry   SIX delegates, Secretary Clinton has gained 13 delegates. At this point it seemed that the caucus was over. But as Dore reports, it was at this time that the chairman of the caucus realized he  made two huge mistakes. First, all of the people who were allowed to caucus without ever registering to vote were never directed to return to the registration table at the end of the caucus.Worse, the caucus ended before delegates were ever chosen for either candidate.The video shows the chairman telling people not to leave.By this time it s way too late as almost everyone was already gone.Watch the report from The Jimmy Dore Show below.While it s clear that Dore (and the rest of the TYT personalities) favor Sanders over Clinton, the issues documented in these videos should outrage every democratic voter, regardless of which candidate you support.There s clear, undeniable evidence that people who were not registered to vote were not just allowed to caucus, they were directed to do so.No matter how you look at it, it s not just a violation of the rules of the democratic party, it s also a criminal offense.Not surprisingly, the videos above are a virtual goldmine for the conservative media, which is reporting on them as  proof of Hillary Clinton voter fraud,  and  proof of democratic voter fraud. The problems with the caucus were not just confined to this single location. Voters are reporting that people were writing on other people s ballots, while others claim their names were not recorded to the correct candidate during the registration process.The democratic party needs to take these allegations very seriously, especially because there is undeniable proof that unregistered voters were allowed to participate in yesterday s caucus.Featured image from video screen capture via The Jimmy Dore Show on youtube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Kids can now expect to deal with neurological issues as they get older because of the high levels of lead found in their bloodstream.Special Investigator Todd Flood has been brought in along with the former head of the Detroit FBI office and other former law enforcement officials to figure out who knew what and when they knew it. Flood says that manslaughter charges could be on the table. We re here to investigate what possible crimes there are, anything [from] involuntary manslaughter or death that may have happened to some young person or old person because of this poisoning, to misconduct in office,  Flood said.  We take this very seriously. Indeed, he should. The Flint River had been abandoned as a water source for decades by the city precisely because the water was known to be toxic and unsafe for human consumption. This is public knowledge and officials should have known better.But Governor Snyder, who has made it his personal mission to take over city after city and appoint  emergency  managers to do his bidding in an effort to save the state money, has ignored the crisis until very recently when he called it his  Katrina.  Switching to the river was a money-saving scheme that has now backfired into a multi-million dollar catastrophe.And Snyder s emails aren t exactly helping him avoid prison.As the Washington Post reports, emails have been released  showing that Snyder s office knew of the Legionnaires  outbreak more than nine months before the governor announced the problem this January. Snyder s office was even  heavily involved  in the vote the Flint City Council made to make the switch to the river.Perhaps most damning is Congressional testimony by EPA acting water chief, Joel Beauvais, who claimed Snyder and his agencies  ignored federal advice to treat Flint s water for corrosive elements, which are believed to have eroded old lead pipes and contaminated drinking water,  and that  the state delayed for months in telling the public about the health risks. Even Rachel Maddow has shamed Snyder and his administration for their actions and inactions that let the tragedy happen.But Snyder is not the only public official who should be held responsible for poisoning the residents of Flint. Multiple city and state officials ignored the unfolding tragedy for months and even had the nerve to tell residents that the drinking water was perfectly safe even as scientific testing revealed that wasn t the case.As Todd Flood and his team investigate the crisis alongside a federal team conducting a separate investigation of their own, we could end up seeing a line of public officials being handcuffed and fitted for an orange jumpsuit when all is said and done. And that includes Rick Snyder, who frankly should have resigned by now.Ultimately, the buck stops at his desk. He is responsible for protecting the citizens of the state and of overseeing the state health and environmental agencies. It s hard to believe that he knew nothing of this problem for two years.The people of Flint deserve justice. Those who have died because of this deserve justice. The kids who will likely grow up with severe neurological issues deserve justice. And if justice cannot be delivered to Flint, nothing stops public officials from being just as irresponsible in other states.Featured Image: Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Mr. Trump s victory here was not as sweeping as the one in New Hampshire, and there were warning signs as he showed weakness among women and younger voters. But he still won among both independents and Republicans, and among self-described evangelical Christians. He also seemed to have built a coalition that will remain with him through adversity: More than half of voters who made their decisions over a month ago picked Mr. Trump, exit polls showed.That is exciting news! Trump simply has no chance in the general election where his obnoxious racism would turn off much of the country and his general incompetence would lead many conservative voters to not vote. But more importantly, as I ve said many times, Trump has destroyed the illusion that the right wing cares about religion, morals or fetuses. They care about hating Those People and maintaining white supremacy. It s been their motivation for much of this country s history and that s why Trump is their man.Once Rubio or Cruz drop out of the race, the other might consolidate the remaining voters and pass Trump but there s little reason for either of them to do so. Cruz is in it for himself and Rubio is the pick of the Establishment. Trump, of course, is running on pure ego at this point. If this dynamic continues, all signs point to Trump as the nominee and that s the best news possible for Sanders and Clinton.Featured via AI archives""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

His divisive and racist statements about Mexicans and Muslims have caused an uproar with many. His policies on everything from foreign policy to economics are incoherent and juvenile and he would most certainly be dangerous as the next president of the United States. However, there s someone way more dangerous lurking just behind Trump, and that s Texas senator Ted Cruz.Yes, it s been established that Cruz is quite a creepy guy and I m not only referring to his facial expressions or his smirk. Just take a look at what he and his campaign did in Iowa. His campaign propagated that Ben Carson dropped out of the race to get people to vote for Cruz. His campaign also sent out mailers to voters to guilt them into voting for Cruz. However, those alone aren t the reasons. Here is just the first of four reasons why Ted Cruz is the most dangerous person lurking around for the presidency: Number one, Cruz is an ideologue:  Cruz is driven by ideology. Cruz doesn t think there s man made climate change, he rejects same sex marriage, wants to abolish the IRS, holds that everyone has a right to guns, and thinks that there should be no divide between church and state, loves the death penalty, rejects immigration reform, demand the repeal of Obamacare, and he takes a strict originalist view of the Constitution.

He announced on his Facebook page that he would begin fasting on Monday to push Ted Cruz to victory in the upcoming Nevada Republican Caucus   somehow.In the post, which raised eyebrows and made eyes roll, the ever melodramatic Beck told his fans: I would like to ask you to join me and my family Monday in a fast for Ted Cruz, our country and the Nevada caucus. https://www.facebook.com/GlennBeck/posts/10153969800938188He also said he would be spending every waking hour until the caucus on February 23 devoted to promoting Cruz. He s not kidding. On Sunday, Cruz will leave behind the guy from Duck Dynasty and replace him with Beck, who will host an event for the candidate in Las Vegas. On Monday, Beck will again join Cruz, this time in Reno.Beck s support for Cruz seems to come singularly from his disdain for Donald Trump. For reasons that remain unclear, Beck has a seething hatred for Trump that borders on obsessive. It s odd because in so many ways   bigotry, race-baiting, xenophobia   the two are very much alike.In a hilarious show of how little self-awareness he possesses, Beck infamously declared that any Tea Party supporter who favored Trump was actually just a racist.While he questioned whether Trump s supporters are genuine Tea Partiers, Beck said of them,  If you were a Tea Party person, then you were lying. You were lying. It was about Barack Obama being black. It was about him being a Democrat. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. Beck is no doubt right that much of the Tea Party movement was based in racism, but supporting Trump isn t contrary to that movement. It s the logical conclusion.It s unclear what Beck hopes to accomplish by starving himself and his family in order to help Ted Cruz get elected. Yet again it appears that Beck is trying to explicitly tie religious ceremony into the race. And fasting appears to be Beck s go to way of getting God s attention. Just last summer, he went on a six day fast to get ready for an appearance in Birmingham. He told his fans: Join us in fasting and prayer that we may all be humble enough to not only hear the path of The Almighty but we may be willing to walk it with honor, Courage, Love and unity. Last week he boldly declared that God killed Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in order to ensure Ted Cruz became president. Apparently unwilling to  let go and let God,  Beck now hopes to nudge Him along a little bit more with his mass hunger strike.Featured image via Glenn Beck ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Florida Senator Tim Scott, who is backing Marco Rubio, says of Bush s candidacy and how it affects the GOP s chances at the White House: It s hard to tell you what the Bush camp is thinking.

It s hard to answer that question unless you re the candidate. Sen. Scott wasn t the only one to call for Bush s withdrawal from the race. His fellow struggling GOP candidate John Kasich had his campaign put out the idea that tonight it became a four-person race  between Trump, Kasich, Rubio, and Cruz. John Kasich strategist and supporter John Weaver said of the South Carolina outcome: Only four candidates have top-three finishes in any of the early states and can justify staying in. At the same time, John Kasich has now won the so-called  Governors Bracket  by continuing to run strong and beat expectations.

Unfortunately, either one San Fransisco Catholic church mistook homeless people for plants that need regular watering, or they didn t get the memo. Jesus made himself very clear in the Sermon on the Mount that the both the poor and those who show them mercy are  blessed,  but Saint Mary s Cathedral in San Fransisco, California, has decided that those dirty poors don t really need help, anyway.The area s homeless, until recently, were able to take shelter from harsh weather in sheltered alcoves that mark the cathedral s four side doors. Not only did St. Mary s put up multiple  No Trespassing  signs, but they also installed a watering system with a single purpose: to prevent the homeless from seeking shelter there.A San Fransisco CBS station reports: They actually have signs in there that say,  No Trespassing,  said a homeless man named Robert.But there are no signs warning the homeless about what happens in these doorways, at various times, all through the night. Water pours from a hole in the ceiling, about 30 feet above, drenching the alcove and anyone in it.The shower ran for about 75 seconds, every 30 to 60 minutes while we were there, starting before sunset, simultaneously in all four doorways. KCBS witnessed it soak homeless people, and their belongings.One could argue that the watering system might be intended to keep everything clean, but the news station points out that this is not the case. In fact, it serves mainly as a waste of water in the midst of a drought:The water doesn t really clean the area. There are syringes, cigarette butts, soggy clothing and cardboard. There is no drainage system. The water pools on the steps and sidewalks.A neighbor who witnessed the drenching told KCBS,  I was just shocked, one because it s inhumane to treat people that way. The second thing is that we are in this terrible drought.KCBS reports that in addition to being inhumane, the system was installed illegally and may violate water use regulations.<iframe width= 420  height= 315  src= https://www.youtube.com/embed/qkn_MS-UfsI?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0  frameborder= 0  allowfullscreen></iframe> It s very shocking, and very inhumane. There s not really another way to describe it,  said Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homeless.  Certainly not formed on the basis of Catholic teachings. The cathedral confirmed that the watering system was, indeed, installed to keep the homeless from sleeping there but argued that, while the church refuses to allow the homeless to sleep in the doorways of a building that is only used a few times a week (a completely cost-free effort), they really do try to help them. We refer them, mostly to Catholic Charities, for example for housing,  spokesman Chris Lyford said.  To Saint Anthony s soup kitchen for food, if they want food on that day. Saint Vincent de Paul if they need clothes. We do the best we can, and supporting the dignity of each person,  said Lyford, who apparently considers dumping water on the homeless to be dignified.  But there is only so much you can do. Many of the homeless bring waterproof gear and umbrelas to protect themselves from the church s misguided and cruel efforts to keep them from taking shelter, proving the system to be an ineffective deterrant. But the horrible treatment has done nothing but diminish the cathedral in the eyes of its neighbors.The Archdioces of San Fransisco said in a statement that the system would be addressed quickly. Catholic organizations in San Francisco serve thousands of homeless people every year, providing shelter, food, and critical services,  the statement says, defending the church.  That is the true picture of compassionate Catholic care. Unfortunately, it s what happened before they got caught that matters.Watch a report on this horrible treatment of the homeless below:Featured image via CBS San Fransisco""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In her open letter entitled  An Open Letter To My CEO , she wrote: Every single one of my coworkers is struggling. They re taking side jobs, they re living at home. One of them started a GoFundMe because she couldn t pay her rent. Another guy who got hired, and ultimately let go, was undoubtedly homeless. Jane also spoke of how difficult it was to pay her rent when the company would only pay her $12.25 an hour, which translated to $8.15 after tax. Of her monthly expenses, Jane also had to spend over $200 to take public transportation to work, as her apartment was 30 miles away.Jane had tried to find ways to make it work. She explored living together with a co-worker, but soon found out that most of them lived with their parents or also could not afford the rent on their wages. Jane said, I thought to myself,  Oh, I m tremendously f*cked,  so I m just going to try really hard on improving at this job so I can transfer and get a pay increase, but then I was told that wouldn t happen for at least a year. To pay her rent and bills, Jane cut back on groceries and did 40 hours of overnight shifts every week   but she eventually reached her breaking point. She told Business Insider: I brought up the wages in every quarterly meeting I had with my managers. They were well aware that I was struggling despite doing what I could with what I had. The last straw was when I woke up yesterday two hours after going to sleep because my stomach hurt from hunger. And it s something I m used to, but this time it was really driving me to put something in my stomach immediately   I couldn t wait 15 minutes for my rice to cook and it all became very clear that this shouldn t be an issue I was dealing with to the point where I forgot it wasn t normal. It was then that Jane realized she couldn t continue on like this. She decided to start tweeting Yelp s CEO.TwitterTwitterTwitterJane followed those tweets with a blog post on Medium, where she spoke of  balancing all sorts of debt and trying to pave a life for myself that doesn t involve crying in the bathtub every week.  She wrote: I haven t bought groceries since I started this job. Not because I m lazy, but because I got this ten pound bag of rice before I moved here and my meals at home (including the one I m having as I write this) consist, by and large, of that. Because I can t afford to buy groceries. Bread is a luxury to me, even though you ve got a whole fridge full of it on the 8th floor. But we re not allowed to take any of that home because it s for at-work eating. Of which I do a lot. Because 80 percent of my income goes to paying my rent. Isn t that ironic? Your employee for your food delivery app that you spent $300 million to buy can t afford to buy food. That s gotta be a little ironic, right? MediumDriving her point home that her payment at Yelp was NOT a living wage, Jane went on to explain:I got paid yesterday ($733.24, bi-weekly) but I have to save as much of that as possible to pay my rent ($1,245) for my apartment that s 40 miles away from work because it was the cheapest place I could find that had access to the train, which costs me $5.65 one way to get to work. That s $11.30 a day, by the way. I make $8.15 an hour after taxes. I also have to pay my gas and electric bill. Last month it was $120. According to the infograph on PG&E s website, that cost was because I used my heater. I ve since stopped using my heater. Have you ever slept fully clothed under several blankets just so you don t get a cold and have to miss work? Have you ever drank a liter of water before going to bed so you could fall asleep without waking up a few hours later with stomach pains because the last time you ate was at work? That post went viral, viewed by over 85,000 people. In an interview with BuzzFeed, Jane said: I wanted [Stoppelman] to understand that I wasn t some little, annoying fly buzzing around his head. I wanted him to understand that I m not some obnoxious idiot who thinks it s funny to harass the CEO on Twitter. I m someone who has concerns and is reaching out, hoping that he can do something. I was sitting there and thinking,  I hope he sees this and I hope my CEO listens and hears me,  and then it started to dawn on me: I wonder if I ll get fired for saying this out loud? It only took two hours for her to find out. Soon, her company email account stopped working, and Jane was fired. She said, My manager and HR told me the letter and what I wrote violated Yelp s terms of conduct. A spokesperson for the company released the insensitive statement: We do not comment on personnel issues. However, we did agree with many of the points in Ms. Jane s post and we viewed it as her real, personal narrative about what it s like to live in the Bay Area. Most importantly, it s an important example of freedom of speech. We agree with her comments about the high costs of living in San Francisco, which is why we announced in December that we are expanding our Eat24 customer support team into our Phoenix office where will pay the same wage. However, Jane insists that Yelp isn t being honest about why she was fired. She said, Yelp is trying to make this die down by lying about it. Firing someone while their post about pay issues is on the cusp of going viral, that s like a lightning strike in the middle of a super dry forest. Things have just exploded. Jane is currently trying to find a new job, and will likely struggle financially until she can (hopefully) find something more promising than her former position at Yelp.

He was struck at least 11 times by bullets sprayed from the officer s semi-automatic weapons.According to the federal suit, after killing Salinas, the officers were allowed to meet in a room at police headquarters for at least four hours, before they were ever interviewed by police investigators.The family s attorney claims that the officers used this time to plan how they would cover up their actions.The cops claim that they opened fire on the unarmed veteran after he made a series of sudden movements, which led them to believe that he was reaching for a weapon.What the cops did not know at the time, however, is that the shooting was captured on cellphone video, by a bystander.While the video has not been made public, it reportedly does not support the officer s testimony. Instead it shows that there was no lunging or jumping at the officers. What s more, on February 17, Fresno County sheriff Sgt. Joshua McCahill, testified that his fellow officers were NOT in danger when they opened fire on the suicidal veteran.According to McCahill, he was speaking with Salinas, who was sitting unarmed in a flower garden, when the other officers arrived on the scene. He testified that he did not believe his life was in danger.McCahill was the only officer on the scene who did not fire a weapon during the encounter.He testified that just before the other cops opened fire on Salinas, he called out to them to  bag  him, a term used to describe firing on a suspect with a non-lethal shotgun.Instead, the three officers turned their AR-15 rifles on Salinas. According to witnesses, the officers continued to shoot, even after the marine veteran had fallen to the ground.When asked why he did not shoot Salinas, McCahill said  because it was a non-lethal situation. According to Salinas family, he was suffering from PTSD.During the call to 911, Charles Salinas told the dispatch operator that he had no desire to hurt anyone other than himself. Let the record show that I would not even scratch a law enforcement officer,  Salinas told the dispatch operator.When conveying the nature of the situation to police, the 911 operator stated  He says he won t hurt you, but he wants to do a suicide by cop. Listen to the 911 tape below, courtesy of The Fresno Bee.This was an opportunity for law enforcement officers to do something good. There was plenty of room for these cops to use non-lethal force. Instead, they chose to end the life of Charles Salinas, a military veteran suffering from PTSD and depression.Reasonable force is defined as a level of force which would be used by  any reasonable law enforcement officer in the same situation. In this situation there was only one reasonable law enforcement officer on the other scene. That officer did not fire his weapon.

Ted Cruz will actually have to contend with a complaint issued by an Illinois voter who believes that the Texas senator is not a natural born citizen of the United States. After all, it is true the Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta Canada, so if found not to be a natural born citizen, it would disqualify Cruz from not only being on the ballot in Illinois, but would raise questions nationwide.The voter, Lawrence Joyce, is bringing the complaint before the Circuit Court of Cook County in Chicago. He tried previously to have it be heard, but the case was dismissed. However, according to USA Today, he appealed the decision and was granted a hearing for Friday before Judge Maureen Ward Kirby. Joyce, a pharmacist and attorney, and backer of Ben Carson, said: What I fear is that Ted Cruz becomes the nominee, come September, Congressman Alan Grayson of Florida will go forward with his threats and probably several other Democrats will file suit to prevent Ted Cruz from being on the ballot. What Democrats will do at that point is cherry pick which county courthouse they are going to show up in order to file these petitions. It will definitely be interesting to see what happens in this case, because if Cruz is determined not to be a natural born citizen, the implications nationwide would be huge.Just recently, another complaint was brought up in New York over his eligibility, and yet another in the senator s home state of Texas.Cruz has, time and time again, insisted that he is, in fact, a natural born citizen because his mother was born in Delaware, USA, thus making his a natural born citizen through birth. Although, this is still hotly contested by scholars nationwide. Perhaps only time will tell, and we ll all have to wait for the outcome of this hearing.Featured image: Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This was proven in a recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Center, called The Year in Hate and Extremism. The organization discovered that 2015  saw an apparent comeback of Klan groups    a 164 percent increase in KKK membership to be exact, all thanks to Trump.In 2014, membership had only increased by 72   but in 2015 membership had skyrocketed up to 190 despite the fact that two prominent KKK groups had shut down that year. Even with the disappearance of the Fraternal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the Knight Rider Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, there was still a 14 increase increase in active hate groups   something the report says was due to worsening income inequality, the rise of left-wing movements like Black Lives Matter, major advances for LGBT people and growing numbers of refugees and undocumented workers that have angered Republicans and white people. The report blames the GOP for the rise in hate groups, and believes Trump is largely responsible. The report says: The bulk of that anger is coming from beleaguered working-class and, to a lesser extent, middle-class white people, especially the less educated the very same groups that most vociferously support Trump. Being that Trump is a racist that supports white supremacists and his supporters are basically just like him, the report said that Trump served as a mainstream channel for some of America s most racist and awful people to air their bigotry without much consequence. Trump has been given almost unrestricted access to Americans, allowing everyone to be exposed to his rhetoric. Such voters are nostalgic for the country they lived in 50 years ago, when non-Hispanic whites made up more than 83 percent of the population. Today, their share has shrunk to 62 percent as demographic change has transformed the United States into a nation where others have a shot at power. Trump, who has become infamous for his anti-Latino and Islamophobic views, was blamed for fueling the radical right, and encouraging more hateful views.

Republicans have everything to gain by making it harder to vote.One of the hot button issues of the day is Republicans  creation of laws that force people to have valid identification when they vote. The genius behind the plan is that it seems so innocent to require people to show identification in order to vote. However, it has been shown that it can be far harder to have all the valid identification that some states are now requiring than one might think. Oliver notes how hard it can be just to get an ID due to the times that ID-issuing offices are closed: And in some parts of the country, the offices that issue IDs are hardly ever open. In 2012, a study found that in Wisconsin, Alabama and Mississippi, fewer than half of all ID-issuing offices in the state are open five days a week. And in Sauk City, Wisconsin the ID office is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month   and only four months in 2016 even have five Wednesdays,  Oliver says.Those Republicans wish to see vote the least are minority voters, who traditionally back Democratic candidates. That s why during the segment, John Oliver points out how much these anti-democratic schemes disproportionately hurt Black and Latino voters. Studies have shown these restrictions tend to disproportionately impact African-American and Latino voters. In Texas, for instance, experts found that African-American voters were nearly twice as likely to lack voter ID, and Latinos were nearly two and a half times as likely. It s just one of those things that white people seem to be more likely to have, like a sunburn or an Oscar nomination,  says Oliver.The Republican Party is dying due to demographic and ideological changes. Instead of changing their Party s platform, they would rather sink to these pathetic voter disenfranchisement schemes.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Two of North Carolina s congressional districts were so gerrymandered that they might as well spell out  Whites Only  on the map. But not for much longer Via Raw Story:The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected a request to stay a ruling that two congressional districts in North Carolina were racially gerrymandered in a 2011 redistricting and needed to be redrawn within two weeks.A panel of federal judges this month barred elections in the majority black districts, the 1st and the 12th, until new maps are approved, calling the current maps unconstitutional. Congressional primaries in the state are set for March 15.This is only going to get worse for the GOP from here. When Republicans swept to power on a tidal wave of blinding rage and racism in 2010, they immediately started passing Voter ID laws, cut polling stations, reduced the voting hours and, of course, took gerrymandering to a whole new level. They knew that their base of angry old racists was dying, and the only way to stay in power was to rig the elections.But all of this relied on a Supreme Court that would turn a mostly blind eye to all but the most obviously racist voter suppression. With the death the Antonin Scalia, the Court will move to the left and then move left again under the next (Democratic) president. More lawsuits will be brought against Republican gerrymandering and with the precedent set, Republicans will be forced to draw more competitive districts and that will lead to the loss of the House.Now you know why conservatives are freaking out over filling Scalia s seat.

It s the Nestle corporation. Remember how they are now people too? Nestle is pumping 200 gallons per minute of clean water from aquifers that feed Lake Michigan under a permit granted by the state in the early 2000 s. What s even more grossly offensive is what Nestle pays   or rather doesn t pay   for this privilege. They don t pay anything for the actual extraction of water. They pay a $5000 permitting fee to the state and lease a portion of land from a private landowner for housing their facility. It gets even better, though, because not only do they get this sweetheart deal   they re also given $13 million in tax breaks and giveaways by the state for deigning Mescota County worthy of their corporate benevolence by  creating jobs  with their facility.Not only do state Republicans force an average resident of Flint Michigan to pay nearly $1000 a year for poisonous water, but they give away clean water for free so that a corporation can sell it back to the people they took it from for a HUGE profit. In an entire year, Nestle pays approximately .000048 dollars per gallon of water that they then resell for millions of dollars in free profits on top of the millions of dollars they don t pay in taxes.Nestle s spokesperson in Michigan is Deborah Muchmore. She is the wife of Dennis Muchmore, who was the chief of staff for the lead-poisoning terrorist Michigan governor, Rick Snyder. Dennis recently retired from Snyder s office in order to become a lobbyist.

And now the U.S Army reservist, who proudly serves his country despite being openly discriminated against by bigots, is throwing a much-deserved lawsuit back in their face.The gun range, quite openly, prohibits Muslims, as can be seen in the photo:Save Yourself Survival and Tactical Gun Range via CAIRLittle did they realize that the person whom they banned from their establishment was none other than a board member in the Oklahoma chapter of the Muslim advocacy group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is the one who helped file the suit, and the legal director of the Oklahoma chapter, Brady Henderson perfectly stated: Whether the sign in question says  no Muslims  or whether it says  no coloreds  or whether it says  no women  or  no Christians  or  no Buddhists    it is just as un-American and fundamentally it is just as wrong. Fatihah said the range was fine and pleasant with him until he revealed that he was, in fact, Muslim. He said: At that point, they started treating me with suspicion. The ACLU released this as part of their press release: The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates Oklahoma s non-discrimination law as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids certain places of business from denying service to customers based on their race, color, religion, or national origin. Although the business is open to the general public, in July 2015, the owners posted a sign near the front entrance announcing that Muslims are not permitted at the facility and that the business is a  Muslim free establishment. There is no justification for a business denying people service based on religion,  said Fatihah.  I am a servant of my community in every respect, and as a proud American, I have enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve to protect this country. I should be afforded the same rights and privileges as anyone else. When Fatihah arrived at the business s main counter, owners required him to fill out a liability form and provide his name, address, and driver s license number  standard procedure for patrons seeking to use the gun range s facilities. However, after Fatihah identified himself as a Muslim, the owners armed themselves with handguns and demanded to know whether he was there to  commit an act of violence or as part of a  jihad.  Fatihah was then made to leave the gun range without receiving service. According to WBRZ: The Oklahoma store owner s attorney, Robert Muise, says Fatihah was denied service because he was belligerent, not because of his religion. However, if you look at the sign on the front door that reads plain as day, MUSLIM FREE ESTABLISHMENT,  it s hard to buy that story line. It will definitely be interesting to see how this lawsuit moves forward and if justice will be served.Featured image: Council on American-Islamic Relations via Mother Jones""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Cruz also, in a lame attempt at humor (sadism?), decided that if he were to be president he may name Robertson as Ambassador to the United Nations. This suggestion was probably in jest, but really, who knows anymore.When talking about Robertson, Cruz says: You know there s a reason he terrifies the mainstream media. He says the things you re not supposed to say. He actually remembers who we are as Americans and just speaks it with a joy, not with an anger, not with a hatred, with a joy in who we are. Then after saying he d name Robertson to the coveted position of UN Ambassador, he said: How much would you pay to see the Russian ambassador s face when Phil says,  What is wrong with you people?' Okay, here s the thing: Russia would probably really like Robertson because they have the same stance on homosexuality. So, who knows, maybe it would be a budding bromance.If Robertson s views are  who we are as Americans  then, quite frankly, we re up shits creek without a paddle. Most folks who admire common sense and decency for all humans regardless of race, gender of sexual orientation would tend to disagree with the horrendous statements both Robertson and Cruz regularly state.However, it is not at all surprising that Cruz would pander to his idiot base of voters with such a moronic suggestion as Robertson at the UN. His pandering knows no bounds, as was evident when he went full camo in Robertson s official endorsement of him.Needless to say, this is something we should not fret over, because Ted Cruz will not be president if the American voters have anything to say about it.Featured image via flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Bland was pulled over by a police officer for failing to signal as she changed lanes. Hardly a crime worthy of an arrest, and most certainly not a crime worthy of a death sentence. In most circumstances, an officer would likely give a warning, but in Bland s case she was torn from her car and placed under arrest. Bland was later found dead in her jail cell.Looking at the broader picture of what happened when lined up next to a constant string of story after story of police brutality against people of color, Bland s mother Geneva wants change, and she feels the person to deliver that change is Hillary Clinton.In a verbal endorsement of the former Secretary of State, Geneva read aloud a poem she wrote about and for Clinton that states her many reasons why she is backing Clinton s run for the White House.Here is her poem:Now is the time, this is the place, Now we are ready. Hillary is the face. Why am I endorsing this woman to my right? Because she has for years continuously put up the fight.She seeks to make equal pay for equal work a priority. I don t know about you, but that sure works for me! Here s a woman who has shown time and time again, She has the skill, experience and staying power more than 20 years in.Yes, there was Benghazi and the infamous email situation. While both were stressful, she maintained her poise and dedication. Dedicated to seeing mothers who singlehandedly raise babies Finally get compensated equal pay in this world that has gone crazy.Selfless in sitting down with a room of mourning mothers, Who have violently lost their children both sons and daughters. Now this I know to be absolutely true; I am one of those who met with her and was able to make it through.She has a plan on gun laws that s like none other. Unapologetically she speaks out about the NRA and issues of color. Her plan for immigration is to keep families together. She ll end family detention and close private immigration shelters.She supports the bipartisan U.S.A. Freedom Act. President Obama signed it into law, and she has his back! She has fought for quality affordable health care her entire career. So she ll defend the Affordable Care Act and build on the successes of it here.She ll cut taxes for the middle class, raise the minimum wage, and ensure the wealthiest pay their fair share. She ll invest in infrastructure and education. This woman really cares. I ve watched and followed her career, and saw her take hits. Yet she still manages to stand here decades later as if it didn t bother her one bit!As Sandra Bland s mother, I know a little about frustration. You have to stand and push through it, even when you want a vacation. Like me, she misses the counsel of her late father, who told her always  carry a shovel,  So at any given time she could dig herself out of trouble.Like me, she lost her dad in 1993. His wisdom played a big part in the strength she shows you and me. I ve shared with you just some of Hillary s views, Now it s up to you to do your research and vote when you re through.People, we are expecting a new president in nine months. Hillary is that new baby. From now until November let s fiercely support this lady!I present to you, Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton.There s no denying Hillary s long career of hard work and dedication to those who have been oppressed by a system that seems to be working against rather than for them. It s clear the Sandra Bland s mother Geneva feels in her heart of hearts that the person to move the country forward is the former Secretary of State.No matter who we choose on election day, we must make sure it s for someone who truly embodies a path forward for everyone.

With both Sanders and Hillary Clinton working overtime to win over minority voters, this is a huge win for Sanders. Sanders has not polled as favorably among black voters as Clinton has in the past.The endorsement that came from the CCDC shows just how far Sanders has come in the past few months. Yvette Williams, chairwoman of the caucus said that the endorsement,  wasn t a very difficult decision. The CCBC released a statement which in which Williams wrote that while Clinton is qualified, their choice to for who they want to be the next president of the United States is Sanders. Williams writes: With continuing unemployment disproportionately impacting Black Nevadans, over representation in prisons and the justice system, low performing schools, and lack of economic opportunity, we are looking for a President that will dismantle broken systems, and provide access to a new deal. A leader that will fight for wealth and racial equality, quality universal healthcare and lower prescription costs, debt free college education, jobs for American workers, restore and protect voting rights, and work to end racial injustice. Your commitment to getting big money out of politics and restoring our government back to its people is an important concern of CCBC members. Clinton once held a substantial lead over Sanders in Nevada. That lead is gone as polls show the two candidates tied in a dead heat. Endorsements from black intellectuals such as Michelle Alexander and Ta-Nehisi Coates (albeit tacit ones) have helped to shine a light on Sanders  record for standing up for civil rights. They along with a strong backlash against several failed attempts by people to try and smear Sanders  record, have helped the candidate.A win in Nevada would be a major boost to the Sanders campaign. Sanders lost to Clinton in Iowa by a hair, in what was a virtual tie. That coupled with a landslide win in New Hampshire and a win in Nevada would make Sanders the clear front runner of in the Democratic primary. That might change once again when it comes time for the South Carolina primary.

One of the ways they lead their clueless voters into thinking that they really care about abortions is by attacking healthcare organizations that provide the services. That s exactly what happened in Wisconsin on Thursday when Governor Scott Walker signed two bills that will block millions of dollars in federal funding from reaching Planned Parenthood.According to Yahoo News:One of the new Wisconsin rules requires the state to apply for federal  Title X  family planning grant money and to give those monies to  less controversial public entities  such as state, county and local health departments and clinics, a statement from Walker s office said.Planned Parenthood is currently the only entity in Wisconsin receiving this federal money and the funds will not be sent to the organization, the statement said. Less controversial ? The only reason Planned Parenthood is  controversial  is because the GOP has made it so. They attack the group because it is an easy target as the country s largest abortion provider. But they actively ignore the fact that only roughly three percent of the organization s services are abortion related and that federal funding does NOT pay for that three percent   it is illegal and has been since 1976.The other bill that Walker signed into law will restrict the amount of money Planned Parenthood gets back for birth control (and other prescriptions) reimbursements.The bill singles out Planned Parenthood by referring to  a covered entity that is an abortion provider.  Of the 22 Planned Parenthood clinics in the state, only three perform abortions. Planned Parenthood affiliates in Wisconsin serve more than 60,000 patients annually.This is really important because in order to truly be  pro-life  one must actively reduce the need for pregnancy terminations. One of the easiest ways of doing that is by providing women and girls with free birth control. Now, twenty-two clinics are going to have a very hard time doing this because of Walker. If these women do not have access to birth control, then this could result in a boom of pregnancies   Walker should have taken a look at Texas.Together the two laws could block more than $7 million of federal funding from reaching the clinics.  All of this proves that GOP cares less about preventing abortions and much more about punishing women and Planned Parenthood.

But it wasn t long before the students began to realize that there were no white students at the assembly. Someone in the group asked, why are there no other kids except for African-American kids here?  Aaron Perkins, whose sister attended the event, told KATV.  She felt that it was very racist. But school officials insist the assembly was only part of the effort to desegregate the school, which somehow has been allowed to skirt federal law since it was founded in 2011. It s as if they have never heard of Brown v. Board of Education at all.According to school spokeswoman Deborah Roush, Freshmen students were identified by the school because it is a time of transition when they are more easily influenced. Black students were selected with the intent that the assembly would be an extension of the district s court-ordered desegregation efforts, which encourage programs and opportunities tailored to minority students. And that is just complete bullshit. The very definition of desegregation is the ending of policies that keep people of different races apart. So in no way could this assembly be part of that effort. If anything, it s an effort to cling onto segregation, which keeps the races separate.Here s the video via KATV.Not only does this school apparently not know the definition of desegregation, they apparently don t realize how racist this assembly was either. By only including black students at this assembly, the school is assuming that only black kids join gangs or do drugs and that is simply an outrageous stereotype. The school claims students could  opt out  of the assembly, but when a student is called via intercom to go somewhere by the school office, you go. So it definitely looks like these students had no choice and are the victims of racism at their school.Understandably, parents are outraged and the ACLU is now involved. Maumelle High School owes these parents and the students they singled out an apology. And perhaps another court visit is in order to make sure school officials understand what desegregation means.

Now, a GOP politician has come out with another accusation: that president Obama has a soft spot for homosexuals because he was once a gay prostitute. Mary Lou Bruner, a retired teacher and a Republican candidate for the Texas State Board of Education said: That s how he paid for his drugs. He has admitted he was addicted to drugs when he was young and he is sympathetic with homosexuals; but he hasn t come out of the closet about his own homosexual/bisexual background. What is her evidence? Well, as is the case with Republicans when they make terrible accusations, they usually have no evidence but they simply play on the fears of people. What s especially troubling about this case is that Bruner s a serious contender for the 15 member education body which already has a vein of lunacy.

She also said that scientists have hidden hard evidence that humans and dinosaurs lived at the same time.Despite these crazy accusations and far fetched theories, Bruner is not an anomaly. She has become a standard bearer of the Republican party. Featured image from Wikimedia Commons.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

His results in the two early-voting states so far have alarmed more traditional Republicans, who fear that a Trump nomination would solidify for nonwhite voters an image of Republicans as an angry and intolerant party. More traditional Republicans  means the Republicans who are perfectly fine with their base being rabidly racist as long as they keep it out of sight. But after 50 years of the Southern Strategy in which Republicans appealed, almost nonstop, to the racial resentment and petty entitlement of white people in order to secure their vote, the base of the Republican Party has no room left for diversity.In other words, they built that.Just to be clear on how screwed Republicans are, Nate Silver s 538 predicts an 81% chance of a Trump victory in South Carolina. He s currently projected to win with 32% of the vote with Rubio and Cruz coming in at 19.4% and 18.8% respectively.The Times, like much of the media, is trying really, REALLY hard to blame the racism of the GOP base on Trump as if he summoned it from thin air. This is part and parcel of the unspoken pact to pretend that the Republican Party is not an angry and intolerant party. But anyone who s paid the slightest attention to what Republicans say and what they do is very aware that the rest of the party is exactly as racist as Trump, they re just smart enough not to say it out loud. As long as they use dog whistles and coded language, Republicans, aided by the corporate media, were able to pander to their racist base while still appealing to low-information independents that didn t pay attention. Trump is a threat because he s exposing them for who they really are and that will make them toxic to the majority of the country.If Trump, a pro-choice New Yorker that is not religious in any meaningful way can win big in Bible-thumping South Carolina, it shows that racism is, indeed, the prime motivating factor of the Republican Party.Good luck spinning that, corporate media!Featured image via AI archives""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Donald Trump just got caught lying about one of his biggest claims as the South Carolina primary approaches.Throughout his campaign, Trump has hammered Jeb Bush over his brother George W. Bush s terrible decision to go to war with Iraq, a war that cost America trillions of dollars and thousands of lives.He has even claimed to be the only candidate in the GOP field who opposed the war before we invaded and he did so again during the GOP Debate on Saturday night. I m the only one on this stage that said,  Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq,  Trump declared. Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn t a politician, fortunately. But I said it, and I said it loud and clear,  You ll destabilize the Middle East.  That s exactly what happened. Trump repeated himself again on Thursday night during the GOP Town Hall event, even going so far as to say that George H. W. Bush dealt with Iraq the right way when we went to war against Saddam Hussein in order to protect Kuwait in 1992.Up to this point, Trump s claims had gone unchallenged. But now an audio recording has popped up of a Trump interview with Howard Stern that blows both of Trump s claims about both wars in Iraq out of the water.As it turns out, Trump not only lied about his opposition to the Iraq invasion in 2003, he lied about believing that Operation Desert Storm was handled correctly. Are you for invading Iraq?  Stern asked Trump point-blank back in 2002, a year before the first troops set foot in Iraq.TRUMP:  Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly. Here s the damning audio via Buzzfeed.And when Anderson Cooper asked Trump about the Stern interview on Thursday, here is what Trump had to say. I could have said that. Nobody asked me that. I wasn t a politician. It was probably the first time anyone has asked me that question. When you re in the private sector, you get asked things, and you re not a politician, and probably the first time I was asked. By the time the war started, I was against it, and shortly thereafter, I was really against. Note to Donald: It doesn t matter if you were a politician or not. A lie is a lie and your time in the private sector does not exempt you from being called out for it, nor does it excuse it.
