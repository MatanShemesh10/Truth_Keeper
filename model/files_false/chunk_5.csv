 Internet Erupts In Mockery After Sarah Palin Posts Something Monumentally Stupid Again (TWEETS),"For like the eleventy-billionth time, Sarah Palin posted a broken link to a Facebook post on Twitter Sunday. Now, at first glance her months of posting dead links and not figuring out how to fix the problem might seem moderately stupid   until you see the content of the actual post on the half-term, half-wit former Governor of Alaska s Facebook timeline.Referencing Clinton s recent, mundane campaign stop at a bar, Palin   who regularly appears to be heavily intoxicated whenever she has a camera in front of her and was involved in a drunken hillbilly brawl in 2014   quipped,  she s gonna drive us all to drink. Thinking she is clever, she then adds that Clinton should have been  thinking Sam Adams  rather than  drinking Sam Adams. Naturally, as Palin brought up drinking, the internet decided it couldn t let this one go:@SarahPalinUSA I see you've already started  Clodagh Smith (@Clodagh831) October 30, 2016@SarahPalinUSA Any excuse to drink, eh Sarah? #Lush  John Yuma (@JohnYuma) October 30, 2016@SarahPalinUSA Have you been day drinking again?

 Kellyanne Conway LOSES IT On Jake Tapper When He Calls Out Trump’s Bigoted Fans (VIDEO),"One thing that has continuously dogged the Donald Trump for president campaign is the fact that racists, anti-semites, xenophobes, misogynists, and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign. No matter how much Trump s people try to say he doesn t want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. So, naturally, when Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat down with an interview with CNN s Jake Tapper on Sunday, that particular issue came up again. Of course, Conway was not happy. Tapper began: There are a lot of anti-Semites and racists and misogynists who support the Trump candidacy. Conway immediately went on defense, saying,  wow.  Tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting  JEW-S-A  at the press pen at a recent Trump rally, and directly asked Conway if she would refer to such people as  deplorable.  She responded: Yes, I would. Wow, I have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe   I hope you ve been to Trump rallies and I hope that you ve seen the tens of thousands. I mean, he s had over half a million people easily, I think in excess of that. These are U.S.A.-loving Americans. Tapper went on to say that no, he isn t putting all Trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force Conway s hand on this one: But without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic and racists and on and on. And these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti-Semitic fans,  Tapper continued.  He just has. He says things like,  Oh, sure, I disavow, I disavow.  But he has never serious said,  I don t want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me.  He has never seriously done it. Conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the Trump campaign is winning, saying: I think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence I have that we re actually going to win in nine days because the idea that we re going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that Hillary Clinton would bring to the Oval Office in such an important week. No, Kellyanne, it s not a sign that Trump is winning. It s pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began: That Donald Trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. Dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and it s all because of Donald Trump. He embraces these bigots because he s one of them. The quicker you learn that, the better.Watch the exchange below:[ad3media campaign= 1279 ]Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Fans At Wisconsin Game Wear Obama Mask With Noose Attached (TWEETS),"There s no doubt that two men seated near the front row at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wis., are not Hillary Clinton supporters, nor do they support America s first black president. One of the unidentified men wore a Barack Obama costume to Saturday s Nebraska vs. Wisconsin game which displayed a noose around the neck of the president. The other man was pulling the rope around Obama s neck.I can t imagine what it must be like for people of color who have this experience this disgusting amount of hate everyday. I feel sick pic.twitter.com/KmkxkWNcv3  ? (@woahohkatie) October 29, 2016Here s that image again:Employees at the Wisconsin arena ask the football fan to remove the display.The fan also toted a sign critical of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Although the writing on the sign was difficult to decipher in the tweet, judging by the costume we re guessing it wasn t too kind.The situation was brought to the attention of university police on Twitter, but the fan was not removed from the game. The university cited the fan s right to free speech. The Wisconsin police answered tweets from those upset by the costume. Each one said,  While we don t support the offensive image of a noose, its a form of free speech. Guest Svcs. asked them to remove it, they did. @mk_rodgers While we don t support the offensive image of a noose, its a form of free speech. Guest Svcs. asked them to remove it, they did.  UW-Madison Police (@UWMadisonPolice) October 30, 2016At some point, the men exited the arena, this time with one wearing a Donald Trump costume with a noose around Hillary Clinton s neck.It APPEARS the men were first asked to removed the Obama mask then asked to leave. This was their exit  pic.twitter.com/Xv1UxMOfaW  ? (@woahohkatie) October 30, 2016The University of Wisconsin released a statement:During the first half of this evening s Wisconsin football game against Nebraska, UW officials were made aware that an individual in the seating bowl had donned a highly insensitive and offensive costume. UW Athletics  guest services staff were dispatched to the individual s seating area where they asked him to remove the offensive components of the costume. He complied.UW Athletics  policy regarding admission into the stadium with a costume stipulates that no one may be wearing a mask upon entering the facility. Once inside, it is permissible to wear a mask. The costume, while repugnant AND COUNTER TO THE VALUES OF THE UNIVERSITY AND ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT, was an exercise of the individual s right to free speech. The university also exercised its rights by asking the individual to remove the offensive parts of the costume.UW-Madison is dedicated to promoting a campus environment where all people feel valued, safe and able to thrive. To that end, the university continues to encourage all of our community members to engage in discussion over vital issues in ways that promote greater understanding and respect for all persons.What s even more unnerving about the display would be the white people standing around the men seeing nothing wrong with their actions. This was at a football game, not a political event, not that either is acceptable for this sort of behavior.Earlier this month, a man featured a float in a parade displaying Donald Trump executing Hillary Clinton. The float displayed a Trump/Pence sign and a Make America Great Again sign, along with something to do with the Democratic presidential nominee s health.Trump supporters on Twitter are defending the football fans  deplorable behavior, but just as the Indiana man questioned Hillary s health, we should question the mental health of Donald s supporters.Only Trump supporters would find this behavior acceptable while disparaging Colin Kaepernick for his form of silently protesting racial inequality.Image via Twitter.

 SHAME: Proof Trump Doesn’t Care About Military Veterans,"Donald Trump has often invoked the U.S. military and treatment of military veterans while he has campaigned as the Republican presidential nominee. But time and time again, when it comes to actions and deeds, Trump s behavior is that of someone who doesn t really care at all.The latest evidence of that comes from reporting on how he behaved while attacking the family of Captain Humayun Khan, the soldier who died protecting his unit in Iraq in 2004. Trump responded to the Khan family s speech during the Democratic Convention by attacking the family, but now we are learning just how ignorant Trump was while he was involved in this smear.New York Magazine s Gabriel Sherman reported on Saturday that when one adviser warned Trump he had just attacked a Gold Star family, the GOP nominee responded  what s that?  The term is commonly used to refer to any family that has lost a loved one in war. The United States has officially recognized these families since 1936.[ ]Sherman also reported that Paul Manafort, who was then Trump s campaign chairman, had to explain what  Gold Star family  meant.Reporting has shown that with Trump, the Republicans have nominated an extreme narcisst, who doesn t understand any more of the wider world than he has to contend with on a day-to-day basis. Trump neither cares nor does he have the curiosity to care, even if the welfare of soldiers is the issue.His staff has been reduced to being a series of sitters for a wealthy baby.Captain Khan s father, Khizr Khan, is still involved in the 2016 election. Within the last week, Mr. Khan was on the campaign trail speaking about and advocating on behalf of the candidate he believes in and who he trusts to defend Muslims, soldiers, and Muslim soldiers: Hillary Clinton.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Newt Gingrich Unwittingly Makes STARTLING Prediction For 2020 – Before This Election Even Happens,"Newt Gingrich, who s totally, utterly and completely up Trump s ass except for when he s not, claims to know who will be in the general election four years from now. Gingrich seriously thinks that there could be a Trump/Clinton rematch in 2020. No, seriously, that s what he thinks. The rationale he gave to Politico for that prediction is well beyond ridiculous: The challenge for everybody s going to be,  What if he gets 48 or 49 percent?  Gingrich said in a video interview for POLITICO s  Open Mike  series.  And what if he says:  You know, I like this campaign and stuff. I ain t leaving ? There will then be a Trump Party.' Har de har har, don t make us laugh too hard. It hurts.Trump might like the campaign stuff because it helps him promote his businesses, but whether the GOP even allows him to get very far in the process remains to be seen. That s especially true since oh, wait we haven t even had this election yet!Gingrich still thinks that the  odds are better than even  that Trump will win this election. Politico says that Gingrich was on  Open Mike  a few hours before FBI director James Comey released his vaguer-than-vague letter about new emails tied to Hillary, so that revelation must have made ol  Newt cream his shorts.Alas, though, the latest so-called scandal turned out to be nothing, much to the disappointment of all the Hillary-haters out there.Gingrich isn t exactly the best prognosticator the GOP has. He s spent a lot of time predicting that Hillary s numbers will fall, while Trump s will soar. Before anyone takes that seriously, remember that he also predicted that Mitt Romney would win in a landslide in 2012. Not exactly groundbreaking, breathtaking, accurate stuff here.Trump s numbers soaring, while Hillary s crash, hasn t happened. At this point, doesn t look like it s going to happen. 10 days out from an election means most voters even many of the undecided have figured out who they d rather see in the White House.Newt Gingrich is a fucking tool.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"October 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Military Expert Vows To Take Trump Up On His Challenge,"Donald Trump, like any bully, loves to talk crap, but when his victim stands up to him, he always, every single time, backs down. While Trump is a bit beyond the age of schoolyard scuffles (don t tell him that), he does like to challenge people who are much smarter than him to intellectual  scuffles.  One such smart person is retired Col. Jeff McCausland, who is a military expert   one Trump thinks he can teach  a couple things.  McCausland says, bring it on. Trump won t.McCausland is a visiting professor of international security studies at Dickinson University. He s the former dean of the Army War College. He s also a retired army colonel, so, yes, he knows a thing or two about military strategy. He says Trump doesn t  know a damn thing  about it.Trump, when asked about it by George Stephanopoulos, couldn t leave well enough alone. Instead, Trump said about McCausland,  You can tell your military expert that I ll sit down and I ll teach him a couple of things. McCausland, on Dickenson University s website, had a response for Trump: I can t wait to sit down with Mr. Trump and hear what he has to teach me about military strategy. I m happy to compare my record of over 45 years working in national security affairs with his any time. First, let s review Donald Trump s record on military strategy. He never served in the military and never served the government. During the primary campaign, Mr. Trump also made it very clear that he had no understanding of the nuclear triad or nuclear strategy. This is perhaps the most important thing any potential commander-in-chief needs to understand. He goes on to talk about specifics and how Trump is literally wrong about everything, but especially his assertion that Mosul is a  disaster. The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2016McCausland wrote: When it comes to the question of the Mosul offensive, Mr. Trump doesn t understand that 99.9 percent of the troops involved are Iraqi. War remains politics by other means, as Clausewitz once said. The Iraqi government has had a political imperative to publicly state that they would liberate Mosul since it was occupied by ISIS over two years ago. It is the second largest city in the country, and consequently Prime Minister Abadi has had a political imperative to reassure the Iraqi people that this was a goal. Iraq is a sovereign state, which has always been a goal of U.S. policy, so once cities like Ramadi or Fallujah in southwestern Iraq were liberated, everyone knew Mosul was next. He also criticized Trump s plan to take the oil from Iraq, saying that it would take a mind boggling number of troops and would create a lot of casualties. He also says that the population of Iraq would never stand for it. Why would they. Plus, it s a war crime. Not that Trump cares about that.In the end, he simply says,  I reassert my statement to the New York Times: Mr. Trump doesn t know a damn thing about military strategy. The fact is, Trump has literally zero experience with military strategy. Like so many rich kids, he never served in Vietnam. In fact, the man who touts his stamina on the campaign trail was excused from the war for having bone spurs on the heels of his feet. Trump is dangerous, and as so many have said, he should be allowed within miles of the nuclear codes.Featured image via Dickinson.edu.

 Trump Supporters Caught Making Anti-Semitic Chants At Official Rally (VIDEO),"Donald Trump and his political campaign have become, over the last year, ground zero in America for anti-Semitic activity from white supremacists, neo-Nazis and others who hate Jews and ethnic minorities.The latest example comes from a Trump rally in Phoeniz, Arizona, where a man was caught on video yelling  JEW-SA  to reporters sitting in the cordoned off section of Trump s rally.Guy chants ""Jew-S-A"" in front of press pen pic.twitter.com/2yqgA6dD4k  Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) October 29, 2016The video was recorded by Nick Corasantini who is covering the Trump campaign for the New York Times.Trump s campaign has been embraced and supported by the so-called  alt-right,  a rebranding of white nationalists who seek to remove the influence of anyone who isn t a white Christian from America. The  alt-right  regularly promotes Nazi memes online and off, and has repeatedly abused reporters and commentators who are Jewish with death threats, online attacks, and more.Instead of rejecting these people, Trump s campaign has supported them. Trump has re-posted their messages through retweets on his Twitter account, while he has also given them official credentials to cover his campaign and to report from the floor of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.Additionally, Trump s son Donald Jr. gave an interview to a white supremacist radio show, where he and the host lamented  political correctness. Trump s policies have been lauded by white supremacists, specially his anti-Muslim policies, especially his proposal to ban immigration to the United States by Muslims.Former KKK member and leader David Duke has endorsed Trump, and said he was inspired by the support for Trump and decided to run for the U.S. Senate from Louisiana. Duke has attracted enough support within the Republican Party there to qualify for an invitation to a Senate debate, which is being held at a historically black university.In a CNN interview, Trump refused to directly rebuke or renounce Duke s support, choosing to do so only after he was on TV. Many white supremacists took this as a sign of support from Trump for their movement.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" New York Magazine Confirms: Trump LITERALLY Only Cares About One Thing, And It’s NOT Winning","With just ten days to go until the election, one would expect that Donald Trump and his campaign would be in a flurry of final pushes to win over undecided voters, and maybe, possibly a final push towards really reaching minorities. Instead, his campaign is just as screwed up now as it was when it launched, according to an in-depth look at the campaign courtesy of New York Magazine. Perhaps most damning is that Trump has more or less told his own campaign manager how he really feels about people, even his own followers: I got really mad at him the other day, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told me. He said,  I think we ll win, and if not, that s okay too.  And I said,  It s not okay! You can t say that! Your dry-cleaning bill is like the annual salaries of the people who came to your rallies, and they believe in you!' He shrugged off all his followers in that conversation, as well as Conway. While a ton of his followers are pretty disgusting people, they re still his followers, and he really ought to give half a damn about them. Honestly, though, why would a narcissist like Trump care about anyone? The biggest reason the campaign has failed to reach various sectors of the population is, in large part, because Trump thinks he can just do whatever he wants.But that s not all. It s actually to be expected that Trump wouldn t care about anyone but himself. However, he doesn t know what to do with all these followers. All he really knows how to do is keep them fired up in their righteous anger. In doing so, their blind devotion feeds his ego and helps keep him in the spotlight.And instead of listening to guidance from his advisers, he s increasingly using the campaign just to bolster his brands. His style, which bugged the hell out of his former manager, Paul Manafort, continues to bug the hell out the rest of his staff. The only exception might be Steve Bannon, who may have his own plans for all those supporters whom Trump is throwing under the bus.Some say that Trump can t handle actually taking advice, including Manafort s advice to keep a low profile and force the media to focus on Hillary: His ego couldn t handle it,  said one Republican close to the campaign.  Hillary understood that Trump needed to be the focus.  As his poll numbers climbed, Trump felt he didn t need to listen to Manafort.  The worst part about Trump is when he was ahead,  the prominent Republican said.  He d get into the lead and then he would veer off and start defending his interests and his honor and it had nothing to do with what people actually care about. He s not disciplined. And his ego is what fueled his feud with the Khans, who are a Gold Star family that lost their son in Iraq in 2004. That was all about his ego   he didn t even know what a Gold Star family was before he decided the Khans were his enemy: The election is about the American people, it s not about you,  Manafort told Trump, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Trump countered with Breitbart s report on Khan s purported belief in Sharia.  He s not running for president,  Manafort shot back.  The Clintons did this to us to waste our time getting off message. And it worked   it worked very well. Everything anyone has ever done in this campaign to get Trump off message and onto whatever just bruised his poor widdle ego again has worked.Trump might well be looking to the future   but it s very likely not a future in the White House that he sees. There have been rumors floating around that he s using this campaign to start his own media company. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is busy compiling 14 million email addresses and credit card numbers of loyal Trumpkins, which New York Magazine speculates could form the basis of a new Trump media company.While Kushner denies all of this, a spokesman for a Republican who declined to be named told the magazine: Kushner has approached Wall Street bankers and pitched ideas for media start-ups.  How do we monetize this?  he s asked. (Through a spokesperson, Kushner denied having such meetings.) Whether it s his own media company, or promoting his own business interests and ego, or both, it s clearer now than ever that Trump doesn t care what happens to his followers, let alone whether or not he wins. He wants the spotlight. How he gets it is of no consequence, and what he does with it is of even less consequence. This could be good news for us because it could solidify Hillary s win, but it lays bare the sheer lack of character that exists within Trump.Featured image by Sara D.

 Trump Supporter Kicked Out Of Trump Rally; Bet You Can Guess Why (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s popularity with African-Americans is somewhere near zero. Still, there are some African-American Trump supporters, but it appears that Trump doesn t want anything to do with them, at least not when they show up to his rallies.An African-American Trump supporter attended a rally for the GOP candidate on Wednesday in Kinston, North Carolina. Soon, Trump s other supporters began singling the man out by waving their signs in his direction. When Trump saw him, his initial response was,  That s all right, leave him alone. Then, Trump changed his mind.  We have a protester,  said the candidate to boos from the crowd.  By the Way, were you paid $1,500 to be a thug? Where s the protester? Where is he? Was he paid? This was in reference to a heavily edited video by James O Keefe that supposedly implicated Democrats in sending violent agitators to Trump rallies.Then, Trump s security detail began escorting the man out of the rally, with cheers from the audience and  You can get him out. Get him out,  from Trump.Here s the video:This man was no Democratic plant, even if the Democratic plants exist. He was a longtime Trump supporter and North Carolina resident, C.J. Cary. All he wanted to do was hand the self-described billionaire a note.Cary, in a phone interview Saturday with The Washington Post, said he had gone to the rally because he wanted to hand-deliver a note to the Republican presidential nominee. He made his way to about 20 to 30 feet from the stage and was shouting  Donald!  while waving his note around to try to catch his attention. Everyone else is waving Trump signs and I m waving this white letter,  Cary, 63, said. He said that, coupled with the fact that he was wearing sunglasses during an evening rally to deal with his sensitivity to light, may have been what set people off.Source: Washington PostStrangely, Cary still wants to vote for Trump. He believes he shares a history with the businessman. Cary wrote to Trump back in 1992 when Trump was separating from Ivana. Trump allegedly wrote back. Since then, he s been a fan   a yuuuuge fan. He has about 100 Trump signs in his yard and he wants to defeat  lying Hillary and lying Obama.  Why does he like Trump? He calls him  honest,  while Trump calls him  a thug.

 Virginia Paper Trolls Gov. Pat McCrory Hard With Its ‘Endorsement’ For His Re-Election,"After Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed HB2   dubbed the  bathroom bill    into law, the state lost a lot of business. Corporations canceled expansions in the state, therefore scrapping jobs that they were planning to offer and entertainers canceled events over the anti-LGBT law. Some of the business that N.C. lost made its way to Virginia.The Roanoke Times threw its support behind McCrory s re-election in the trolliest way possible. Which candidate would do the most to help our local economy? That s easy. It s Pat McCrory, the Republican governor of North Carolina, who s seeking his second four-year term in the November election.  reads the Friday editorial. We can point to specific and multiple ways he has helped the economy   our economy. North Carolina panicked and made a spectacle of itself by passing HB2, its so-called  bathroom bill.  In response, various companies and even sports leagues pulled events from the state,  the editorial continues.  Three of those have wound up in Salem   the NCAA Division III men s and women s soccer championships, as well as the Division II Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association football championship. That s money in the bank for us,  it says.The  endorsement  further states:McCrory has given Virginia a competitive advantage in economic development, as well. When the University Economic Development Association recently held its national conference in Roanoke, the keynote speaker highlighted a North Carolina program to encourage partnerships between colleges and companies, as a way help recruit technology companies interested in research and development. The speaker hailed it as a model for other states to follow as they try to build a  knowledge economy.  Then the speaker noted that McCrory had cancelled it. The pro-business audience groaned.On Monday, a data company picked Richmond as the site for a new office, with 730 jobs. Industry officials said it beat out Charlotte specifically because of HB2.Feel free to argue all you want which presidential candidate would be best, but it s clear that Virginia would be best served if North Carolina re-elected McCrory.In March, McCrory signed HB 2 into law which prohibits transgender people from using public bathrooms that match the gender they identify with. McCrory wants government so small it can fit in your bathroom.The state is losing money due to Gov. Bigot s insistence of signing the law. $395 million isn t exactly peanuts.And there s more:That doesn t include the $250 million and 730 jobs the state lost this week when CoStar Group, a real estate research firm, announced it chose Richmond, Virginia, for a major expansion instead of Charlotte, North Carolina, because of the law.Business boycotts and pullouts have cost North Carolina another $87.7 million, according to Wired.Roy Cooper is leading McCrory in the polls.Photo by Chip Somodevilla via Getty.",News,"October 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Says Hillary’s Emails Are Worse Than Watergate, Watergate Prosecutor SHREDS Him","When former President Richard Nixon s cronies broke into DNC Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in 1972, it was a scandal so monumental and unprecedented that Nixon became the first and only president to resign from the office.The perpetrators were trying to bug the offices and Nixon attempted to cover up the crime using government resources.Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, merely used a personal server to receive and send emails as Secretary of State. While her decision to use a personal server was a bad one, it is hardly a crime and that is what the FBI declared in July when the agency declined to charge her with a crime.Fast-forward to October and Hillary again finds herself in Republican crosshairs as Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters continue to call for her arrest after the FBI reportedly found three emails related to the email investigation on a device belonging to Anthony Weiner.As NBC s Pete Williams reported soon afterward, none of the emails were sent by Clinton or her campaign, nor were these emails hidden by Clinton or her campaign.In fact, the FBI has only just begun investigating the emails and a conclusion won t be reached until after the election and all the signs suggest the FBI will find nothing criminal about these emails either.Yet Donald Trump continues to yammer on to his supporters about how this is an  October surprise  that should derail Hillary s campaign and that her emails are worse than Watergate.Yeah, he totally thinks this situation is worse than the biggest political scandal in American history.But former U.S. Attorney Nick Akerman vehemently disagrees.Akerman was a prosecutor who worked on the Watergate case, so if anyone can compare a scandal to Watergate he s the one to ask.According to a statement provided to Mic, Akerman wrote that FBI Director James Comey acted inappropriately by writing a letter to Congress informing them of the new emails because they haven t even been reviewed yet, which means Comey didn t even bother getting all of the facts before giving Republicans something to whine about only ten days before Election Day.But Akerman saved the real ass-whooping for the Republican nominee and compared him to a past Republican who is just as disgraceful as Nixon. Donald Trump s statement that this is bigger than Watergate is totally absurd,  Akerman wrote.  There is no evidence of any violation of law. For Trump to reach that conclusion based on a total lack of evidence is reminiscent of the innuendo spread by Joseph McCarthy in the early 1950s. #Watergate prosecutor @nickakerman letting both James Comey and Donald Trump have it over today s Hillary Clinton email developments: pic.twitter.com/uWExp4VKyx  Celeste Katz (@CelesteKatzNYC) October 28, 2016That sound you just heard is the sound of all the heads of Trump supporters exploding.Featured Image: Mark Makela/Getty Images",News,"October 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" BUSTED: Trump Supporter Tries To Rig Election For The GOP, Gets ARRESTED","Donald Trump has repeatedly accused Democrats of rigging the election against him, but it turns out his own supporters are doing everything they can to rig it in his favor.And that includes voting twice, something Republicans continually claim that Democratic voters always get away with doing.The Des Moines Register reports,Terri Lynn Rote, 55, was booked into the Polk County Jail about 3:40 p.m. Thursday on a first-degree election misconduct charge, which is a Class D felony.Rote, a registered Republican, reportedly cast an early voting ballot at the Polk County Election Office, 120 Second Ave., and another ballot at a county satellite voting location in Des Moines, according to a Des Moines police report.So just to recap, Rote literally committed voter fraud in a desperate attempt to get Trump and the Republican Party an extra vote in this election.That s the precise definition of election rigging, but you won t hear Trump say anything about this because he thinks that Democrats are the ones committing voter fraud, which is why he has called for his supporters to intimidate minority voters at polling places.But this incident is far from the only time during this election that a Republican has been caught trying to rig the election.A Wisconsin city clerk was recently busted for trying to deny an extra polling place near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she argued in an email that students lean Democratic. I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,  Kris Teske wrote. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats. Imagine if a Democratic clerk denied letting a church be a polling place on the premise that most religious people are Republicans. The outrage and whining would last for days.And a right-wing group is literally creating fake badges so they can infiltrate polling places in order to intimidate voters on Election Day. Keep in mind that Republicans often accuse Democratic voters of using fake IDs to vote multiple times, but here s a right-wing group making fake IDs so they can use voter suppression tactics to swing the vote in favor of Trump.Thus far, it appears that only Donald Trump s supporters are trying to rig the election, not Democrats as he so often claims. And just think, there are still ten days left until Election Day. Still plenty of time for even more hypocritical Trump supporters to be caught trying to rig the election for the small-handed man who whines about how unfair our democratic system is.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Crudely HUMILIATED A Woman Onstage Because She Accidentally Didn’t Introduce Him,"Donald Trump is a petty thin-skinned wannabe dictator who loves revenge. And this is proof.As we all know, the Republican nominee is getting hammered by sexual assault accusations and the fact that he bragged about groping and kissing women against their will.We also know that Trump retaliates over the smallest slights or perceived slights and has no problem insulting women.Well, during a Miss Universe appearance in Australia back in 2011, Trump went on stage and promptly announced to the audience that he intended to get revenge on someone because they didn t introduce him because of a simple miscommunication. Get even with people,  Trump said.  If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that. Then he called out the name of his victim, who also happened to be the 2004 Miss Universe winner from Australia, and demanded she come on stage and stand beside him so he could make an example of her in front of everyone. I ll give you an example: Jennifer Hawkins. Where s Jennifer? Where s she sitting? Get over here, Jennifer. First of all, how beautiful is Jennifer? This is about getting even. I was so angry at her yesterday. Seriously, as I said, I thought that she dissed me. I thought that my Jennifer   I m going around saying she s my favorite Miss Universe, but I think I like the new one better, Jennifer. So I go around saying she s the greatest   then when I came here, there was no Jennifer Hawkins to introduce me. Hawkins tried to defend herself by explaining that there was a miscommunication, but Trump disregarded what she had to say and proceeded to viciously humiliate her in front of her countrymen and women. I was actually going to get up and tell you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but she s not very bright. That wouldn t have been true, but I would have said it anyway. Because I said,  You know what, it would be great. I haven t seen Jennifer in a couple of years. She s so great and she did so well, and she s a big star here, and I helped her make it   I own the Miss Universe pageant. And I heard that she wouldn t introduce me. And then to add insult to injury, Trump tried to crack a sex joke and then attempted to kiss Hawkins even though she clearly was not interested in having Trump s lips anywhere near her.Here s the video via Huffington Post.Donald Trump is a creep and a pervert who thinks revenge is the answer to any little insult or slight, real or imagined. He does not have the temperament to be president and the thing we need is a revenge-obsessed egomaniac in control of America s nuclear arsenal and military forces.Featured Image: Kena Betancur/Getty Images",News,"October 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Learn The FACTS About What The FBI Is Saying Concerning Hillary’s Emails; Trump LYING (DETAILS),"The media everywhere seems to be jumping on the new revelation of Hillary Clinton s emails without actually reading what was written by FBI Director James Comey.While Donald Trump, alongside pretty much every mainstream media branch, is saying that the FBI is  reopening  the investigation, that s not at all what was written.Comey, doing his due diligence and informing Congress that new emails had been discovered, sent the following letter: In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony. Note the word  supplement. He continued: In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that they FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to out investigation. In other words, they are looking at them to determine if they should include them in the previous investigation. Which is solidified with this next point: Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony. In other words, Comey is being completely transparent as the emails are looked at, but he never said the investigation is being reopened. Rather, the additional emails that were found are being assessed to see if they need to be subject to further scrutiny.In addition:BREAKING: US official: Newly discovered emails related to Clinton investigation did not come from her private server.

Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) October 28, 2016It s really disappointing to see the lack of reading comprehension in the media that thus gave Trump the go-ahead to use a new attack line that is built purely from hyperbolic fabrication.No, this is not Trump s  October surprise  but rather an over-reaction to someone actually showing the government can do its job.Watch Pete Williams be the person to actually explain the story with facts:  NBC s Pete Williams: Sr. officials say During separate investigation  a device  led to add'l emails not from Clinton https://t.co/QmmNoxXhOx  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016Featured Photo by Joe Raedle via Getty Images",News,"October 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 REVEALED: Trump Was A Creepy Pervert With Pregnant Women (VIDEO)," Shark Tank  star and insanely successful real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran has known Republican nominee Donald Trump for over three decades   and she recently showed that there s no one better to drop a truth bomb on America about who The Donald really is.In an epic interview with Erin Burnett, Corcoran added more weight to the allegations of the twelve women who have come forward against Trump, claiming that the business mogul sexually assaulted them. Corcoran admitted that she saw inappropriate behavior from Trump quite often, and she was even the victim of his misogynistic, degrading behavior at one point in time.Corcoran admitted that when she was pregnant, Trump began talking excessively about her breasts while they were in a business meeting. Corcoran recalled the time Trump sexualized and objectified her: I was pregnant with my first child at the time. So was his second wife [Marla Maples]. And he compared my breast size to his wife by putting his hands in the air, telling me how large they are. If a man is that way   so inappropriate   I just assume it s that way all the time. Corcoran showed solidarity with Trump s victims and not only said that she believed them, but said she thought it was preposterous that he s claiming he s done nothing like that. The popular investor also said she hoped she was wrong about her earlier prediction that Trump might win the election, noting that she thinks he will self-destruct before he gets any closer to the White House.You can watch Corcoran blow the lid off Trump s lies below:Corcoran is now the second  Shark Tank  investor to rail against Trump, following billionaire Mark Cuban, who has been destroying Trump every chance he gets for the last several weeks.Featured image via Frederick M.

 Team Trump Puts A Proverbial Gun To The GOP’s Head: Support The Nominee Or Else,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made life a living hell for party leaders since he first began to rise in the polls way back in the overcrowded GOP primary season. Against all odds, Trump s bombast and demagoguery wooed disaffected GOP base voters, and he managed to steamroll past other established, much more qualified Republican presidential candidates. In the interim since then, Trump s controversies have caused many issues for party leaders who have been forced to try to defend and vouch for their nominee. The worst instance of this, of course, was the infamous Access Hollywood tape in which Trump had a lewd and offensive conversation with Billy Bush.Well, since that tape caused condemnation across the board   even causing many leading Republicans to withdraw their endorsements- the result was a well-publicized and fiery civil war within the GOP writ large. Now, with just 11 days to go until Election Day, the Trump campaign is making an effort to hold the party hostage, and force support for the embattled Trump/Pence ticket. An email, obtained by the Washington Post, was sent around to GOP elected officials, which read: I know we are less than 11 days to the 2016 election. But it is imperative that we continue to drive Republican support for the top of the ticket. That means we need your direct, strong support for the Trump/Pence ticket. Now is the time. No waffling, no week [sic] knees. We strongly urge you today to make a statement   take a stand   and step out for the Trump/Pence ticket. So, in other words, this is a  support Trump or else  message. Trump himself has already floated the idea of punishing party leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan for disloyalty, especially since some of these people are only supporting Trump because they are forced to. Now, Team Trump is essentially holding the GOP hostage, and if their demands are not met, make no mistake   the consequences will likely be dire.Hopefully these Republicans don t cave to Trump s insane, strongman-like tactics, and can show a bit of spine and limp on to election day.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Racist Fox News Goon Gets PUNKED By Comedian On The Streets,"When Fox News goon Jesse Watters went to Chinatown in New York to put together an incredibly racist segment filled with Asian stereotypes, it caused national outrage.Now Watters is getting a taste of his own medicine thanks to comedian Jason Selvig.During Watter s racist report, he talked to residents who didn t speak much English, asked them if they know karate and if they can  take care of North Korea for us. Fox News, Bill O Reilly, and Watters disrespected and insulted the Asian-American community that day, and they have still not issued an apology despite Asian-American organizations raining hell on them with statement after statement condemning the segment.So Selvig treated Watters the same way.Selvig approached Watters on the street and gave him a hug before saying  hello  to him using a racist Asian accent. Pretty good, right?  Selvig asked Watters.  It s racist like you like. A confused Watters then realizes what s going on and tries to run away like a coward. But Selvig continues mocking him by pitching future segments Watters should consider for his next  man-on-the-streets  bit. Just a bunch of black people eating fried chicken?  Selvig suggests.  How about just Mexicans eating tacos? Selvig then suggests a segment on gay people, but then remembers that Watters already did that and shows some footage of it. Oh just like, call all Muslims terrorists,  Selvig continues before nixing the idea because  I guess you guys already do. Selvig tells Watters that he ll leave him alone if he plugs his movie  Undecided.  When Watters avoids doing so, Selvig takes matters into his own hands and declares that it s endorsed by Fox News.Here s the video via Facebook:Jesse Watters and Fox News should think twice before doing such a segment ever again. In fact, they should just not do these kinds of segments at all. But if they do, perhaps comedians from all over can approach Watters on the streets and mock him. It s called karma, and Watters just got a taste of it.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: CNN Host Calls Out Trump Supporter For Urging People To Grab Their Guns If Trump Loses,"This election is already the nastiest one on record in American political history. The aftermath could end up being the bloodiest if Trump supporters follow through on their threats. If she s in office, I hope we can start a coup,  Trump supporter Dan Bowman declared at a rally earlier this month.  She should be in prison or shot. That s how I feel about it. We re going to have a revolution and take them out of office if that s what it takes. There s going to be a lot of bloodshed. But that s what it s going to take I would do whatever I can for my country. Bowman is not alone either. Many Trump supporters are simply waiting for Trump to give the word on Election Day, like this person who aimed a gun at Hillary while she was on television during the debate.This all stems from Trump s assertion that the election is rigged for Hillary Clinton and that  Second Amendment people  should do something to stop her.And right-wing radio hosts like Joe Walsh are only throwing gas on the fire. November 8th, I m voting for Trump,  the disgraced former Tea Party lawmaker wrote on Twitter before adding,  On November 9th, if Trump loses, I m grabbing my musket. You in? On November 8th, I m voting for Trump.On November 9th, if Trump loses, I m grabbing my musket.You in?  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016During an interview with CNN on Friday, Walsh claimed that he was merely calling for  civil disobedience. If I wanted people to take up arms, why would I recommend people take up an antique like a musket?  Walsh told Chris Cuomo.  I mean, seriously, in 2016 I want people to go out and find a musket, grab their musket? That s just silly. But that doesn t explain why he said everyone should grab their guns if Trump loses. A musket is, in fact, a gun and definitely implies that people should grab their guns.In fact, Walsh doesn t even care if Trump loses fair and square, he still wants people to revolt against the government with their guns. If she wins fair and square, then the anger that a lot of Americans have toward our political system   and she s part of that   we ve got to double down and triple down and do whatever we can to defend our freedom. That phrase,  grab your musket,  is a phrase I ve used probably a hundred times in the last two or three years. Cuomo didn t let Walsh get away with trying to spin his own words, however. The CNN host reminded Walsh of another tweet he posted in the wake of the killing of police officers in Dallas. Words matter, context matters,  Cuomo pointed out.  You say,  This is now war, watch out Obama, watch out Black Lives Matter punks, real America s coming after you.  You only take this one way   you take it provocatively. Trump is the master of this, and you have to now argue whether that s a good thing or a bad thing. You tell me why it s good. Walsh then dropped his  civil disobedience  spin and went straight to talking about grabbing guns and going to war against the federal government, which would be treason. Look, when I say,  grab your musket, man, and let s go to war if Hillary wins,  the Republican Party s going to be in our sights. Because all these people are pissed off again at what we believe, Chris, is a corrupt political system. Here s the video via Twitter.Former Rep. Joe Walsh: When I said grab your musket if Trump loses, I meant we need  to defend our freedom  https://t.co/lgJho3xleM  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 28, 2016Trump supporters are dangerous threats to public safety and our democracy. This nation s government needs to be prepared for the strong possibility that right-wing nuts will attempt a bloody coup or commit acts of violence wherever they are in the country in retaliation of a Hillary victory. That means President Obama should put the military and National Guard on standby.

" Jimmy Kimmel Asks Trump Supporters To Say ONE Nice Thing About Hillary, This Is What Happened (VIDEO)","In the simplest of terms, one way to describe Donald Trump supporters would be to call them interesting. However, not interesting in a way where they have profound things to say and should be respected for all the things they do, but rather interesting in a way like when you visit a circus and wonder how so many clowns can fit into one car. That would, in fact, be interesting to find out.Catching up with a few of these interesting people was none other than Jimmy Kimmel s team on his late night show. He interviewed a number of them on the street in Hollywood and told them that it s Hillary Clinton s birthday. He then asked if they could say at least one nice thing about her for her birthday. The replies were, let s just say, less than kind.One woman said: I can t say anything positive. I d ask her if it s truly her birthday or if she s lying about that too. Another guy said: Happy birthday, Hillary. I hope you get arrested. One woman did muster up the strength to compliment Hillary s hair, but she wasn t happy about saying it.It definitely seems like there s a lot of anger coming out of the Trump campaign and their supporters, along with a lot of false information. Here s hoping they will be able to find happiness in life even when Hillary becomes president.Watch the segment and all their weird hatred towards Hillary here:[ad3media campaign= 1266 ]Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Report: Hillary Wants Joe Biden For HUGE Role In White House,"A new report indicates that Vice President Joe Biden s long tenure in Washington, D.C. may not be over just yet if Hillary Clinton has anything to do with it. According to Politico, the Clinton brain trust is considering offering Biden one of the most important roles in her administration if she wins the election. Joe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary Clinton s transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO.This would be the first major Cabinet candidate to go public for a campaign that s insisted its focus remains on winning the election, and perhaps the most central choice for a potential president who was a secretary of state herself. The report indicates that a formal offer of the position has not been discussed yet between Biden and Clinton.Biden has years of experience with foreign policy, including time leading the Foreign Relations Committee when he was a U.S. Senator from Delaware, and he has been one of President Obama s closest advisors on the topic while serving as Vice President.Biden considered running for President this year, and some polls indicated he would have been a strong challenger to Clinton. After the death of his son Beau, he decided against the campaign and has endorsed Clinton. His speech in favor of Clinton at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia was one of the highlights of the event.He has been holding campaign events on her behalf and is among the all-star team of surrogates including the President, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Senator Bernie Sanders that are promoting Clinton s campaign.Biden has also dedicated himself to leading the so-called  moon shot  project to cure cancer, a position that President Obama announced for him during his final State of the Union address.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump: ‘We Should Just Cancel The Election’,"At a rally in Toledo, Ohio, Trump made his most frightening statement of this election cycle yet. After comparing his tax plan to Hillary s, he boldly proclaimed: And just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for? What are we having it for?Her policies are so bad. Boy, do we have a big difference.  [emphasis mine]We should just cancel the election and install him as what? President? We all know he won t stay President for very long if we do that. He wants to be installed as the first King of the United States. Even if he were democratically elected in twelve days, he d probably try to make this the last election this country ever sees.Anybody who doesn t see that after what he just said is both blind and foolish.Oh wait, perhaps he was just joking, just being funny? It s a very dangerous and inappropriate joke to make on the campaign trail, particularly for someone who has long since begun displaying fascist tendencies.Trump has fallen well behind Hillary across national polls, in battleground states, and even in a few deep red states like Arizona, Utah, Texas and Georgia. They re in play for the first time in forever. Trump s only hope may well be to simply be installed as the king, rather than elected to the White House by the people.We have people like former Congressman Joe Walsh calling for armed rebellion if Trump loses. We have people like Rep. Jason Chaffetz promising years of investigations into Hillary if she s elected. We have Trump himself calling for his supporters to intimidate voters at the polls in the name of ensuring that nobody votes who isn t legally allowed to, and claiming that there s already widespread voter fraud in Texas.He s incited his crowds toward violence, and he s undermining our democracy with his cries of unfairness, election stealing, and rigging.Now he says,  We should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump.  That s the worst thing he can say as a presidential candidate in a democratic society. The worst.

 OUTRAGE: Bundy Family Terrorists Get Off Scot-Free,"The domestic terrorists who staged an armed takeover of a federal facility have been given a  not guilty  verdict by a jury in Portland, Oregon. Despite their actions not being in dispute the group led by Ammon and Ryan Bundy have just become the latest example of a justice system bending over backwards for some, while punishing others.Ammon and Ryan Bundy and five of their followers, charged in the armed takeover of a federally owned Oregon wildlife sanctuary in January, were acquitted Thursday of federal conspiracy and weapons charges.The verdict brings to a close a case that gripped the nation earlier this year with its public debate about government powers, public lands and constitutional rights.The brothers and their followers took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and held it for six weeks. Their extreme demands were that the federal government surrender control of the 188,000-acre property.The brothers also issued a call to arms to fringe militia groups across the country, asking them to stand with them on the property in the apparent hope that they could trigger another dangerous standoff with the government like Ruby Ridge or Waco, which both ended in death.The Bundy brothers came to national prominence after their father Cliven Bundy refused to pay the Bureau of Land Management after his livestock had grazed on federal property for years. Bundy, an extreme right-winger, believes that the government does not have proper jurisdiction over federal lands. But in fact, repeated court decisions show his position to be in an extreme minority.Initially, mainstream Republican and conservative figures rallied to Bundy s side, including Senator Rand Paul and Fox News host Sean Hannity. But that support faded away when video surfaced of Bundy musing that blacks may have been  better off  as slave instead of having government assistance.Featured image via Multnomah County Sheriff s Office",News,"October 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Gary Johnson Has ANOTHER Insanely Incoherent Meltdown During Interview (VIDEO),"Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson isn t doing too well in the polls, and a recently released interview is not going to help him. Apparently, Johnson is beginning to feel the pressure and he s taking it out on the press by giving unpredictable interviews   unless he s just trying to take a page out of Donald Trump s book by acting erratic.When Johnson was interviewed by the Guardian s Paul Lewis, there were several tense, uncomfortable moments   such as when he yelled at Lewis for mentioning his dwindling poll numbers or questioning his tax policy.The interview begins on an awfully uneasy note when Johnson flat-out admits to Lewis that he s stupid while sporting a very creepy smile   and it s clear that Lewis doesn t understand if Johnson s being serious or not. The interview is confusing from the start, as Johnson doesn t seem focused or able to control his mood.The worst part was toward the end of the interview when Lewis corrected Johnson that his support in the polls was now only 6%, not the 10% that Johnson claimed. Johnson responded by blowing up and yelling: Why are you even interviewing me? I don t get it. If I m doing so poorly, is this to preside over a funeral here? It s not a funeral! It s a celebration! Another horrible moment came when Lewis asked Johnson to explain his tax plan. Lewis brought up the fact that most economists disagree with Johnson s approach to nix federal income tax and enforce nationwide consumption tax   which made Johnson unravel right in front of the camera. Johnson admitted that Congress wouldn t approve of his tax plan, and then fired back with a weird detour about legalized marijuana: Look, I don t want to argue. I don t want to argue, really. Look, I came out for the legalization of marijuana, let me just use that as an example. And I will tell you, I had people in my face for years and years and years talking about how stupid and idiotic it was that we should allow marijuana to be legal. Lewis was understandably shocked, and he had to ask Johnson why he d bring up marijuana when they d been talking about taxes. Johnson yelled,  It s leadership! As we ve seen with the Aleppo situation, Johnson just doesn t do very well with interviews   and this video should be a clear sign that voting for Johnson won t get America very far, especially when that vote could have been used against Republican nominee Donald Trump.

We could care less about her birthday,  the woman continued, going on to remark that she hopes Hillary won t be in the White House.The woman then proceeded to tell Chariton that she won t be happy about a Clinton being in the White House, even though it would mark the first time in American history that a woman has been elected President of the United States.  Absolutely not,  she said.And instead of citing her policies or anything else, this Trump supporter said she opposes Clinton because of her gender.  I don t believe there should be a woman President,  she said.And that means any woman. But why? I believe in Christianity and I see that she does not stand for the Christianity,  she went on to say. Does Christianity say you can not have a female President?  Chariton followed up. It doesn t say,  she replied.  I just don t believe there should be woman leaders. I believe women should stand back from things like this, especially the White House. In other words, this Trump supporter believes that a woman s place is being submissive to men just like conservative  Christians  believe. The woman Chariton interviewed doesn t even think women should be  speakers.  Translation: women should shut up and stay in the home and not have any say in political matters whatsoever.Later in the video, the same Trump supporter reversed herself by saying that Jesus might frown upon a woman being a leader and further stated her belief that Donald Trump feels the same way.She went to say that she thinks the 12 women who have accused Trump of sexually assaulting them were paid by the Clinton Foundation to do so. It s an accusation with ZERO evidence to support it. But there is lots of evidence suggesting that Donald Trump is a sexual predator.Here s the video via YouTube.To recap, Donald Trump thinks women are sex objects for men to conquer and do with as they please. His supporters don t give a damn about the victims he has harmed over the years. Trump supporters have also been calling for the 19th Amendment to be repealed, which would strip women of the right to vote. And now we have video of a Trump supporter saying that no woman should ever be allowed to be a leader or speaker.And yet Republicans wonder why women continue to leave the GOP.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Sends Out DANGEROUS Tweet Claiming Voter Fraud In Texas, State Voting Officials Call BULLSH!T","Donald Trump has been shouting that the election is rigged against him for weeks. On Thursday morning, the GOP nominee woke up bright and early to post on Twitter that he has been receiving reports of widespread voter fraud taking place in Texas.A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2016Trump was presumably referring to already debunked reports that the votes of some people trying to vote a straight Republican ticket were being changed to Hillary Clinton, a claim believed to have originated in Tarrant County. However, Snopes reports that this  vote flipping  is due to user error, not a rigged election. Reports are not flooding in from across Texas about vote switching, and most anecdotes are identical with localities changed,  Snopes wrote on Wednesday.Texas officials were also quick to call out Trump s tweet for the load of crap that it was. Frank Phillips, the election administrator for Tarrant County, told WFAA that the claims of  vote flipping  turned out to be bogus, just like every other time there are reports of this nature. Historically, he said, these are cases of user error. Typically, we ve found it s voter error with the equipment,  Phillips said.  Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates   or do something with the wheel. There is not an issue with the equipment. Election officials have been urging voters to double-check their ballots before turning them in. Earlier this week, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also urged his constituents to make sure their selections are correct before casting their ballots. Make sure all of your selections are correct before hitting the button to cast a ballot,  Abbott posted on his Facebook page.Trump has ramped up his claims of a rigged election as the election has gotten closer and his poll number have gotten lower. This is not only bullsh*t, it is dangerous and irresponsible. He is sowing seeds of doubt about the very election process that is the foundation of our democracy, all because he can t admit that he is losing.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Problems With Women Get Worse As Another Beauty Queen Comes Forward With Assault Story,"Donald Trump keeps saying that all the women who have come forward alleging that he acted in a sexually inappropriate way toward them are liars. However, the stories are remarkably similar, and they reflect Trump s own words on the now-infamous Access Hollywood tape where he bragged to then-host Billy Bush about sexually assaulting women. Well, on Thursday, those issues deepened, as a 12th woman came forward.Ninni Laaksonen once held the title of Miss Finland. Speaking with Finnish tabloid Ilta-Sanomat, she says that Trump touched her rear end inappropriately in 2006, where the pageant participants were doing an episode of The Late Show with David Letterman. Laaksonen says: Before the show we were photographed outside the building. Trump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt. I don t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought,  What is happening? What is most interesting here is the fact that this young woman didn t go out of her way to go public with these allegations. The paper she spoke with, which is supposedly the second-biggest publication in all of Finland, went looking for women in the nation who had histories with Trump. That is how Laaksonen was found, which makes her allegations against Trump all the more credible. She didn t go looking to attach her name to this scandal unfolding in the United States presidential election, but that is what happened, just because she chose to be brave.Perhaps the grossest part of all of this is what Laaksonen says someone told her regarding Trump s attraction to her: Somebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger. This is just disgusting. The GOP really should be addressing this with the public. They are literally trying to put a sexual predator in the Oval Office. This just goes to show that they do not care about the women of this country, or about the nation itself at all. They care about their party and their careers, and that s it.Hopefully, more women are found between now and election day, and they won t be able to be ignored.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Plan To Strangle The Supreme Court To Death In Retaliation For A Hillary Victory,"Making sure that Democrats take control of the Senate just became even more important.Ever since Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Republicans have refused to let President Obama fill the vacant seat he left behind on the Supreme Court bench. President Obama even nominated Merrick Garland, whom many consider to be a moderate who has even been praised in the past by the very Republicans who are blocking him now.There had been rumors that Republicans may approve his nomination if Hillary Clinton wins the election in order to prevent her from nominating someone more liberal to the post. But now it appears Republicans have something even more sinister in mind if they end up keeping control of the Senate in November.Arizona Senator John McCain, despite joining with his fellow Republicans to declare that the next president should get to pick the next Supreme Court Justice, has already urged Republicans to block any nominee Hillary Clinton puts forward, only to backtrack when outrage ensued over his remarks.But most Republicans think that s a good idea and want to take it even further by letting the Supreme Court die.As we all know, Supreme Court Justices may be appointed to serve for life, but they don t live forever.All of the medical technology and advances in the world are not enough to provide eternal life to humans. So even if every current Justice vows to serve till their last breath, new Justices will eventually be required to make sure the Supreme Court continues.Republicans, however, would rather the high court just disappear instead of doing their jobs by holding confirmation hearings for any of Hillary Clinton s nominees. And they seem to be getting their new playbook from Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute, a right-wing organization funded by the Koch brothers.Apparently, Republicans have decided that if they can t get the conservative dominated Court they want, they ll settle for destroying it entirely so that it is no longer a functioning institution. As a matter of constitutional law, the Senate is fully within its powers to let the Supreme Court die out, literally,  Shapiro wrote for The Federalist on Wednesday. I simply can t blame politicians who follow their convictions,  he continued.  If you truly believe that a particular nominee would wreak havoc on America, why not do everything you can to stop him?  So when you get past the gotcha headlines, breathless reportage, and Inauguration Day, if Hillary Clinton is president it would be completely decent, honorable, and in keeping with the Senate s constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names. In other words, Republicans have no intention of letting the next president pick the next Supreme Court nominee, or any nominee for that matter, unless the next president is Donald Trump. For all their talk of letting the voters decide who gets to pick the next nominee, Republicans are making it clear that they will ignore the will of the people if they elect Hillary Clinton on November 8th and will reject every nominee she puts forward.That means the Court will drag on with only eight Justices, which will result in more cases that result in 4-4 ties that fail to settle the law, which would give red states the power to have state laws that conflict with our Constitution. Essentially, it s a way to shift power to the states by default. And it would only shift more as other Supreme Court Justice die or retire. Once the Court bench dwindles too much, the Justices will have an even harder time keeping up with the case load, which means justice will be delayed.And this strategy could even affect lower courts as well. Without courts to keep them in check, conservatives could pass any laws they desire knowing that courts will be too backed up or are nonexistent to stop them, meaning more anti-gay laws, voter suppression laws, and anti-women laws will be enacted by red state legislatures with impunity.It s an impending constitutional crisis that Republicans are orchestrating.This a dangerous interpretation of the Constitution and it runs contrary to the established precedent that has been set since America s founding. No Senate has outright refused to hold confirmation votes on any nominees put forward by a sitting president. While the Senate has voted a handful of nominees down, they ve never blocked any and all nominees picked by a president no matter how divided the executive and legislative branches are politically.But that s exactly what Republicans are planning to do if Hillary Clinton wins and they get to keep control of the Senate, which means at least two more years until Americans can flip the Senate to more reasonable lawmakers. And it could actually end up being four more years of gridlock since the party that controls the White House often suffers midterm election losses.In short, the only thing that can prevent Republicans from letting the Supreme Court whither on the vine and die is the American people in this presidential election. Republicans must NOT be allowed to keep control of the Senate. The viability, functionality, and survival of our judicial institutions depends on Democrats taking back majority control of the Senate. If voters fail to do this, it could mean the end of the Supreme Court and justice in America.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"October 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Jill Stein Has Millions – Thanks To Big Pharma, Big Oil And Wall Street","Jill Stein, Green Party candidate for President of the United States, has made her case this election by painting herself as being the anti-Hillary Clinton. She claims that Clinton s ties to Wall Street and her more  cozy  feelings towards big corporations and polluters make her a faux-progressive. So Stein claims that she is the true outsider progressive who has the people s best interest at heart and that she will end the too-big-to-fail mentality on Wall Street.But her investment portfolio shows something completely different.Uncovered by the Daily Beast, Stein has millions of dollars worth of investments in the very entities she rails against in her faltering presidential campaign:According to the financial-disclosure form she filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on March 30, 2016, Stein and her husband, Richard Rohrer, have investments (with the exception of real estate) valued at anywhere from $3,832,050 to $8,505,000. (Stein told The Daily Beast she inherited  over a half-million dollars  from her parents.) We don t know their exact net worth because filers are only required to provide a range of the value of their investments as opposed to exact values.Those investments, which but Stein s net worth in the millions (what an outsider), are held in mutual funds or index funds which provide more consistent, safer returns than individually picked stocks.Stein is invested in:Stein also has $50,001-$100,000 invested in a fund that represents Raytheon, which is the fourth largest defense contractor in the world and relies heavily on military contracts.So all of these entities, in which opposition to has been the cornerstone of Stein s campaign, are also her biggest benefactors financially.For years Jill Stein has made it her mission to paint Hillary Clinton and other Democrats as backstabbing, two-faced, corrupt shills while glorifying herself as a goddess in the progressive movement. Meanwhile, she s been padding her net worth thanks to big oil, big pharma, Wall Street and defense contractors.Of course the Stein campaign refused to take any shred of responsibility, telling the Daily Beast:Like many Americans who hold retirement accounts, pension funds, or who invest in the American economy, my finances are largely held in index funds or mutual funds over which I have no control in management or decision-making. Sadly, most of these broad investments are as compromised as the American economy degraded as it is by the fossil-fuel, defense and finance industries.She also left out the part where she could, if she really was the principled candidate she says she is, forgo these investments and invest the money somewhere else:While it s true that Stein would not have control over the investments of the funds she invested in, she did have a choice of whether to invest in these funds to begin with. In the past, political candidates, in an effort to avoid a conflict of interest or have their judgment called into question, have invested their entire portfolios in U.S. Treasuries, cash/cash equivalents, in socially responsible index funds, or clean-energy funds. In her statement, Stein said that she has  explored  more socially responsible funds but  found their investments in fracking and large-scale biofuels not much better than the non-green funds. I have not yet found the mutual funds that represent my goals of advancing the cause of people, planet, and peace. But apparently big pharma, oil and Wall Street investments do?Ladies and gentlemen, Jill Stein: America s hypocrite of the year.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"October 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Uncovered Video: Trump Makes CREEPIEST Comments Yet About His Daughter (VIDEO),"It s clear that Donald Trump thinks his daughter is beautiful. There s nothing wrong with that. All fathers are supposed to believe that, but Trump s fatherly admiration of Ivanka goes far beyond just thinking she s beautiful   he finds her sexually attractive and that s creepy as hell. The latest video to come out adds a new dimension to Trump s attraction to his own daughter.There is certainly history. Trump loves to have Ivanka sit on his lap, to the point of her appearing to give him a lap dance.Image courtesy of Snopes.The GOP presidential candidate (the best they apparently could come up with) has joked numerous times about dating, or even marrying, his daughter.Still, in none of these instances did Trump specifically mention sex. This newly uncovered video, from just three years ago, does. In an appearance on the Wendy Williams show, Trump and Ivanka were asked what they had in common. Ivanka answered as you might imagine the daughter of a rich person. She said that golf and real estate are their two main common interests. Her father, though, said something entirely different,  well, I was going to say sex, but I can t relate that to her. Oh, thank goodness he stopped himself from saying  sex,  right after he said  sex. Check out the look on her face:Here s the screen grab of the very brief (if you blink, you d miss it) but telling moment:Maybe this is just an innocent joke of some kind, but even if it is, it s very telling. Donald Trump seems to see women through just one prism, and that s whether or not he s sexually attracted to them. It s also highly likely that when Ivanka was a child, her father had almost nothing to do with her, so that could have something to do with the apparent fact that he doesn t have normal fatherly feelings toward his daughter. Instead, like all women, Trump sees her as a sex object.Featured image via video screen shot",News,"October 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Supporter Lynches Hillary Doll At Rally During Trump’s Appeal To Black Voters,"If Trump supporters seriously want black people to vote for the Republican nominee, they should leave their nooses at home.Because during a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday evening in which Donald Trump made another desperate appeal to black voters, one Trump supporter draped a rope around the neck of a Hillary Clinton doll and hung her in effigy above the crowd for all to see.Ginger Glover is a toy store owner, so getting her hands on a  Lyin  Hillary  doll was easy. But it was a terrible idea to promote lynching imagery in a state where black people suffered lynchings in the past.Glover claims that she was only trying to say that Hillary should be  incarcerated at the very least  and that hanging her in effigy was  just for effect. Here s the video via YouTube:From 1877 to 1950, approximately 100 African-Americans were lynched in the state of North Carolina.Hanging a political candidate in effigy is an act of violence or threatened violence that has no place in our elections.This incident is even scarier considering that many Trump supporters are openly threatening to assassinate Hillary Clinton or lead a violent overthrow of the federal government if Trump loses the election, threats that only get worse as Trump continues to claim that the election is rigged against him.Nevertheless, it s going to be damn near impossible for Donald Trump to attract black voters to his campaign, especially if his supporters are bringing nooses to rallies and threatening to hang Hillary.African-Americans are not going to appreciate that imagery and they will not vote for man who condones it.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump: The Hundreds Of People I Insulted On Twitter ‘Deserved’ It,"The New York Times published a piece displaying the 282 people Donald Trump has insulted on Twitter since he announced his run for the White House. It had to be a  daunting task for the paper because the GOP nominee uses his Twitter account like a punching bag against anyone who hurts his tender feelings. The GOP presidential nominee needs to be in an anger management group instead of social media. According to Donald, though, the people he lashed out at deserved it. It s ok, most of them deserved,  Trump said on ABC s  Good Morning America. I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I ll use that,   he continued.  And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn t come out   you have to be careful with it. Melania Trump was also interviewed. She explained that as First Lady, she would focus on social media. The wife of a cyberbully said, What s going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well. We need to teach [children] how to use it, what is right to say, what is not right to say, because it is very bad out there and children get hurt,  she added without one bit of irony.Trump said that he agreed that so many people are  hurt  by social media. She feels very strongly about. She understands it very well,  Trump said.Trump hasn t changed. Even before his run for the presidency, he insulted random Twitter users.  Are you making less than minimum wage, don t worry, the government will protect you. Afraid to give your real name? You should be,  Donald tweeted to a Twitter user in 2013. By the way, Trump blocked that Twitter user after the exchange.Imagine if Barack Obama lashed out at random people on the Internet because people hurt his feefees in 2008   then in 2012.Donald continued his  rigged election  rhetoric in the interview. That s likely because he s preparing himself for defeat in November. He won t take losing gracefully and neither will his supporters.Image via screen capture.

 BUSTED: Trump Supporters Get Caught Creating Fake Badges To Intimidate Voters At Polling Places,"Conservatives claim that voter ID is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out they re the only ones creating fake IDs to use on Election Day.Trump supporters are taking Trump s call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake ID badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them   all of which are illegal.But, Trump s deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a right-wing group known as  Vote Protectors. The group, which is affiliated with top Trump ally Roger Stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on Election Day. They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes.According to the Huffington Post,Stone s group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake  exit polls,  efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least that s what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his group s websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law.In fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a  bad idea  and  ordered them taken down. Campaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. It s inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,  she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping.  When that s being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it. Indeed, but that s exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him.As it turns out, he s right about the election being rigged, only it s conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump.Earlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,  Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats. So not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well.And that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trump s deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images ",News,"October 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Anderson Cooper And Ana Navarro NAIL Hypocrite Newt Gingrich To The Wall,"Newt Gingrich must really be regretting his little temper tantrum on Megyn Kelly s show now.Because his tirade about Kelly being more  fascinated  with sex than policy really has backfired spectacularly in the last 24 hours, culminating in a brutal takedown on CNN.All Megyn Kelly did was correctly point out that Donald Trump is possibly a sexual predator, which caused Gingrich to explode in rage and be completely disrespectful towards Kelly.Anderson Cooper and his panel discussed the former House Speaker s hissy fit on CNN on Wednesday night, and it didn t take long for Gingrich to be slammed for being a total hypocrite because of his past sexual misconduct.Cooper fired the first shot by calling it  ironic  that Gingrich would call Kelly  fascinated by sex  when he cheated on his first two wives, including an affair that took place during the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton. For Newt Gingrich to accuse Megyn Kelly of being fascinated by sex,  Cooper said after turning to Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes for a response.  This is a guy, who s what, on his third marriage, cheated on his first two wives and was having an affair when he was impeaching Bill Clinton. Isn t that right? Hughes used the  glass houses  defense and tried to turn the discussion into one about Hillary Clinton.Needless to say, Hughes and fellow Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany humiliated themselves by trying to defend Gingrich s offensive outburst.But GOP consultant Ana Navarro had no problem blasting Gingrich, and she corrected Cooper before proceeding to rip Gingrich a new one. I think the word you were looking for was  hypocritical.  Remember Newt Gingrich s wife? When he was running in 2012, told all of us, told the media, said it to the camera. Newt Gingrich offered her the choice between an open marriage or a divorce. So maybe, just maybe, if all of that baggage is on your shoulders, maybe you shouldn t be the surrogate out there wagging your finger and accusing the woman who was reporting on sexual assault   let me explain it slowly   sexual assault and sex are two things. One is unwanted. One is wanted. So maybe they need to understand that to begin with. Let us not confuse sexual assault and sex. And if you are going to get a surrogate to speak on it, and wag his finger on national TV, maybe, just maybe, go find the Pope or somebody that s been on his knees in a chapel for the last 20 years. Not Newt Gingrich. Here s the video via YouTube.Gingrich should publicly apologize to Megyn Kelly for his behavior on Tuesday night. It was unacceptable and only demonstrated precisely why Trump is getting hammered at the polls by women right now. Scottie Nell Hughes should tell Gingrich all about glass houses next time she sees him because he certainly could have used that advice before making a jackass out of himself. Or better yet, Gingrich should just keep his mouth shut and disappear from the political landscape entirely.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Democrats SUE Republicans Over Plot To Rig Election,"Democrats appear to be completely fed up with Donald Trump s bizarre conspiracy theory where he alleges   without evidence   that the presidential election will be  rigged.  Trump has also called on his supporters to show up in minority-heavy voting precincts in a move that many believe is an attempt to suppress the vote, to  rig  things in his favor.Now Democrats are suing the Republicans.The Democratic National Committee is suing the Republican National Committee for aiding GOP nominee Donald Trump as he argues that the presidential election is  rigged,  claiming that Trump s argument is designed to suppress the vote in minority communities.The suit, filed Wednesday in US District Court in New Jersey, argues that the RNC has not sufficiently rebuked Trump for the line of attack, which he has used as a rallying cry and is assumed to be a way to explain away a potential loss on Election Day.The Democrats argue in the filing that  Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be  rigged  based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in  certain areas  or  certain sections  of key states. Republicans are still bound under a consent decree due to a previous court case, which limits their ability to officially send people to polling stations to intimidate voters. At the same time, outside fringe right wing armed militia groups like  The Oath Keepers  have recently sent out calls to patrol voting booths on Trump s behalf.Knowing how vital the votes of Latinos, blacks, and others are to Democratic hopes   especially with President Obama off the ballot   Republicans appear to be highly invested in any and all schemes focused on cutting down the number of voters. If they can suppress minority turnout, which has always been anti-Republican but could now form the foundation of a landslide, Republicans think they could pull out a (tainted) victory.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Libertarian Candidate Gary Johnson STUNS America With Statement On Presidential Election,"For months, various third parties have been making all sorts of noises about how we need third-party candidates in the presidential elections if we ever want to break the tyranny of the two-party system. This has resonated especially well with people who think Hillary Clinton is about as bad as Donald Trump. However, Libertarian Gary Johnson, and his running mate, Bill Weld, have issued a surprising announcement about this election that doesn t include begging for votes for Johnson.The Johnson-Weld campaign believes that Trump is a monumentally bad choice for President of the United States, saying, in their statement on the matter: A President of the United States operates every day under a great deal of pressure   from all sides, and in furtherance of many different agendas. With that pressure comes constant criticism.After careful observation and reflection, I have come to believe that Donald Trump, if elected President of the United States, would not be able to stand up to this pressure and this criticism without becoming unhinged and unable to perform competently the duties of his office.  [emphasis mine]No, Trump wouldn t be able to handle the pressure. Johnson and Weld are both reading this quite correctly, because Trump is a) too thin-skinned to deal with hostile world leaders who might ridicule him (along with a hostile Congress that just won t do his bidding), and b) just plain too mired in fascism to be the leader of the free world. He would destroy the free world.The campaign went on to say: Mr. Trump has some charisma and panache, and intellectual quickness. These qualities can be entertaining. Yet more than charisma, more even than intellectual ability, is required of a serious candidate for this country s highest office. A serious candidate for the Presidency of the United States must be stable, and Donald Trump is not stable.  [emphasis mine]While it does sound like they re admitting defeat and endorsing Hillary, or, at least, trying to convince people to vote for Hillary, that s not quite the case, whatever other sites have claimed. The Johnson-Weld campaign wants the Nov. 8 election to be between Johnson and Hillary, rather than Hillary and Trump: Governor Weld and Governor Johnson are campaigning nonstop, with rallies and appearances scheduled over the next few days across the country from Alaska to Cincinnati, and are fully committed to giving voters the third choice they deserve in this election.Any suggestion to the contrary is the product of active imaginations and partisans in both the Republican and Democrat camps who see how many independents, millennials [sic] and other disenfranchised voters are looking to the Johnson-Weld ticket as a vote they can cast in good conscience. Either way, the Johnson campaign, despite being much closer to Republicans than Democrats ideologically, cannot stomach voting for Trump. They can t tolerate their voters voting for Trump, either, but neither do they want their voters choosing Hillary.Featured image by Bill McCay via Getty Images for SiriusXM",News,"October 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Analysis Of Trump Camp’s Spending Shows Trump Wins For The MOST Backward Campaign EVER,"Most political campaigns prefer to spend the bulk of their money on ad buys, internal polling and other research, voting lists, campaign field offices, staff   you know, the stuff a campaign actually needs if it wants to succeed. However, it seems that Trump s campaign doesn t care about any of that. Not only do they not have a ground game to speak of, but they don t spend their money on anything substantial.They re spending their money on hats.And t-shirts and signs but lots and lots of hats   promotional merchandise that doesn t really do anything to further Trump s campaign beyond his very tired slogan,  Make America great again. The Washington Post conducted an analysis of Trump s final campaign finance filing with the Federal Election Commission. They found the campaign has spent $1.8 million on polling over the last sixteen months, but they spent $3.2 million on hats. Because clearly, those hats are the most important part of the campaign and nobody else gets that.Or so you d think with how Trump loves to look like a tool wearing those hats at his rallies.Trump keeps touting his business prowess as what makes him so eminently qualified to run this country, because reasons. His campaign is running more like a business that thinks spending its money on endless advertising and promotional materials is better than, well, spending money actually running the company (or in this case, a presidential campaign).All told, Trump s campaign has spent more on hats than it has on payroll. In fact, there are allegations going around that Trump is refusing to pay a lot of his campaign staff. The Post s analysis found that the amount of money Trump has spent on hats is nearly three times what they ve spent on payroll. That could be why they act like they can t afford to pay their staff which is just sickening.Add to that the fact that his hats (and other merchandise) are made in China, presumably to cut down on costs, and you have to wonder just how many hats they ve bought and how much they ve earned back.Featured image by Mark Wallheiser via Getty Images",News,"October 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Joy Behar CRUSHES Newt Gingrich On ‘The View’ For Disrespectful Attack On Megyn Kelly,"Newt Gingrich just got owned by the ladies of  The View. On Tuesday night, the Kelly File host interviewed Trump supporter and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.As the pair argued about the accuracy of polls that show Donald Trump getting his his ass beat by Hillary Clinton, Kelly pointed out that Trump hasn t exactly been helping himself when it comes to the women s vote due to his comments about groping women and the sexual assault allegations that have been raining down on him ever since.When Kelly suggested that Trump may be a sexual predator, Gingrich exploded and flew into a disrespectful rage against her. I m sick and tired of people like you using language that s inflammatory that s not true!  Gingrich yelled while wagging his finger at Kelly.  When you use the words, you took a position. And I think it s very unfair of you to do that, Megyn! I think that is exactly the bias people are upset by You are fascinated with sex and you don t care about public policy! That s what I get out of watching you tonight! Kelly responded by telling Gingrich that he doth protests too much and then ended the interview by telling him to go deal with his anger issues.Whoopi Goldberg and her co-hosts absolutely loved the way Kelly handled herself and the way she humiliated Gingrich.Candace Cameron Bure said she admired Kelly for standing up to Gingrich, only to then ruin the moment by agreeing with him that the media is biased.Goldberg replied by pointing out that the media took Bill Clinton to task back in the 1990s and that she would love to hear Trump talk about policy if he could ignore every little slight against him long enough to do so.BUre then complained because Trump isn t getting positive coverage from the media, only to get smacked down because Hillary Clinton is talking the way Trump is on the campaign trail.Then Joy Behar chimed in with the praise of the day to save the segment from going down the rabbit hole. Megyn got him, he was bleeding from wherever,  Behar quipped about Gingrich in reference to an attack on Kelly made by Trump early in the primary when he said she has  blood coming out of her wherever  just because she asked him about the many insults about women he has made over the years.  She nailed him, you know what I mean?  Behar continued.  When I watched that, I was like,  Yes! Sara Haines also enjoyed watching Gingrich get his ass handed to him and remarked that Trump only has himself to blame for the way the media is covering him. Jedediah Bila agreed. Newt Gingrich needs to watch The Kelly File, because she is tough on everyone,  Bila said.  She s not somebody who picks favorites, she s somebody in this business who does her job. It s not her fault that Donald Trump has said and done some horrible things   that s Donald Trump s fault. Bila concluded by pointing out that if Trump  were out there talking policy well and articulating policy well, that would be the story but that s not the story because that s not what he is doing. Here s the video via YouTube.Newt Gingrich made a huge mistake attacking Megyn Kelly in the way he did. Because it only solidifies the image that Trump and his supporters have zero respect for women and that image is killing Trump and Republicans as a whole in the polls right now.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rudy Giuliani Gives The Most INSANE Reason Why Trump Isn’t A Racist (VIDEO),"The All Lives Matter movement may have just found its new spokesperson. On Wednesday morning, Rudy Giuliani gave everyone who denies racism more reason to be loud in their cause to ignore social justice issues. And unfortunately, Giuliani s words were meant to defend the most racist American of all.The former mayor of New York City went on MSNBC earlier today to argue that Trump couldn t be racist, even though Trump has been supported by white supremacists all over the country and has an ever-growing history of racist behavior. But not only did Giuliani say that Trump is not a racist, he said that NO ONE is a racist   pretty much solidifying that he should never be in any position of power considering he does not understand the current state of America or the basic human rights issues that many Americans are facing today. Giuliani said: Racist? The last thing in the world Donald Trump is is a racist. I ve known him for 28 years. The man likes white people. He likes black people. He likes Hispanic people. He plays golf with them. Giuliani has obviously forgotten the time that Trump called Mexican immigrants drug dealers, immigrants and rapists, or the fact that Trump wouldn t rent apartments to black people in the past   among several other racist things Trump has done over his lifetime. But it gets worse. In an astounding, baffling display of white privilege, Giuliani argued that racism wasn t actually a thing. To say that Donald Trump is a racist is outrageous, and to call anyone a racist is outrageous Then, Giuliani railed against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for talking about racism in America and actually treating it as the serious issue that it is. He said: If she thinks we all have implicit bias, Hillary, I got news for you: I don t. Maybe you do. I have no racial guilt. Not a single bit of it. Which is why I m willing to tell the truth about black crime and what has to be done about it. Truly, it s enough to make your brain hurt.

 Hannity Loses his Sh*t After Social Media POUNDS His Racist Offer To Send Obamas To Africa,"Sean Hannity is a dick and Twitter let him know it.During his radio show on Tuesday, the Fox News host and Trump propagandist had a meltdown because the White House ignored a fake story about President Obama saying he would move to Canada if the Republican nominee wins the election on November 8th.And so, Hannity accused Obama of not making an effort to unite behind Trump if he becomes president and retaliated by offering to send Obama and his family to Africa on condition that they can never come back to America. I ll pay   hang on a second, I m offering   I ll even rent a plane as big as Air Force One. [ ] I have an offer for the president. I will charter a plane for you and your family.

Right-wing host Charlie Sykes even admitted in August that people like Hannity have poisoned journalism and that s why we ended up with a toxic presidential candidate like Trump. We ve created this monster, he said. Look, I m a conservative talk show host. All conservative talk show hosts have basically established their brand as being contrasted with the mainstream media. So we have spent 20 years demonizing the liberal mainstream media at a certain point you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible outlet out there. And I am feeling, to a certain extent, that we are reaping the whirlwind at that. We ve basically eliminated any of the referees, the gatekeepers,  he added.And Sean Hannity is continuing that quest to destroy the credible media so he can spread his fact-free propaganda.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Hollywood Walk Of Fame Star Bashed To Bits With Sledgehammer,"Donald Trump s Hollywood star on the Walk of Fame was utterly destroyed early this morning by a man wielding a sledgehammer and a pick ax.Trump s star has been the site of vandalism before. Earlier this year, a nazi swastika was spray painted on his star and at one point a tiny wall was built around his star. It has also become a popular potty spot for passing dogs and the occasional human. For this reason, the Hollywood Historic Trust even considered removing Trump s star from Hollywood Boulevard altogether.But things went to a new level on Wednesday morning. At approximately 5:45 A.M., a man disguised as a construction worker demolished Trump s star with a sledgehammer and a pick ax.James Otis has taken responsibility for the early morning destruction of Trump s Walk of Fame star. He told Deadline that he had originally planned to remove the star in one piece and take it to New York City to be auctioned off.Otis wanted to sell the star to raise funds for the 11 women who have come forward to accuse the GOP nominee of sexual assault. During a rally last week, Trump vowed that after the election he would sue all the women who have said he assaulted them and called them liars.Although, the LA hotspot is usually packed with tourists, at this particular time of day the site was nearly deserted except for a few bystanders. No police were present at the time of the star s desecration. A cruiser reportedly arrived around 6:15 A.M., but Otis was long gone by then.The Chamber of Commerce has refused to remove Trump s star, despite repeated requests to do so via petitions. At the moment, the tattered remains of Trump s Hollywood star is covered by a small tent. There is no word yet on how the Chamber plans to respond to this latest act of vandalism.Deadline has obtained exclusive video of the star being destroyed, which you can find here.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Helen Mirren BURNS Donald Trump At Women’s Event, And It’s AWESOME","Actress Helen Mirren does not have tolerance for misogynist pigs like Donald Trump. She refuses to put up with it in Hollywood and she definitely doesn t want to put up with it in politics.So during the ELLE Women in Hollywood event in Los Angeles where she was being honored as a legend, Mirren lit into the Republican nominee by informing the audience that she will be the  nastiest of all nasty women,  a clear reference to Trump s disrespectful remark aimed at Hillary Clinton during the third and final debate last week. To make you proud that you chose to honor me tonight, I am going to be the nastiest of all nasty women,  Mirren declared.After giving women several points of advice which included drinking tips and how to have a healthy happy marriage and a career, Mirren took a final shot at Trump by calling on women to  ignore anyone who judges the way you look, especially if he or she is some anonymous miserable creep lurking on the Internet or is a bloated, small-headed dinosaury-handed candidate for President. Oh, snap!Donald Trump is going to lose what s left of his tiny mind when he hears the way Mirren burned him.Throughout his life and this campaign, Trump has hurled sexist insults at women, seeing them as nothing more than sex objects meant to be conquered by men. All of these disgusting remarks and his even more disgusting behavior have come back to haunt him in a big way in this election as over 70 percent of women have an unfavorable view of him and are poised to give Hillary Clinton a historic percentage of the women vote larger than what President Obama received in 2008 and 2012.In fact, if just women voted in this election, Hillary would win by one of the biggest landslides in history.The United States of Women vs. The United States of Menhttps://t.co/F455bP3D8I pic.twitter.com/qjr6zLh640  538 politics (@538politics) October 12, 2016Women need to vote on Election Day no matter what.

" Trump Threatens Joe Biden, Says He Would ‘Love’ To Fight ‘Mr. Tough Guy’ (VIDEO)","Republican nominee Donald Trump usually incites violence against his protesters, as well as women and minorities, but last night he went after one of America s most beloved politicians   our current Vice President, Joe Biden!At a Florida rally, Trump threatened Biden because he d dared to criticize Trump s disgusting  locker room talk  and comments about women. Of course, Trump s only answer to anything is violence. Trump shouted: Did you see where Biden wants to take me to the back of the barn? I d love that. I d love that! Mr. Tough Guy. You know, he s Mr. Tough Guy. You know when he s Mr. Tough Guy? When he s standing behind a microphone by himself. And of course, the man-baby then complained that he s going to be held to an unfair standard by saying that: If I said that, they d say he s violent, how could he have done that Trump had been responding to Biden s comments earlier this week, when the Vice President blasted the business mogul s misogynistic behavior and history with women. Biden s exact words had been: I wish we were in high school and I could take him behind the gym. Biden further clarified that remark and made sure that everyone knew that physical violence is not how you handle disagreements when you re an adult:But since Trump barely has the maturity of a high schooler, a brawl is a perfectly reasonable way for him to solve an argument.

 Trump Supporter Threatens Megyn Kelly For Putting Newt Gingrich In His Place,"Newt Gingrich completely disrespected Megyn Kelly, yet she is the one receiving threats because she refused to be treated like shit by an asshole.During her show on Tuesday night, Kelly tried to explain to Gingrich that Trump is getting destroyed in the polls because women do not appreciate his comments about groping women against their will and the fact that several women have come forward to accuse the Republican nominee of sexual assault. If Trump is a sexual predator,  Kelly continued.But Gingrich angrily cut her off and disrespectfully wagged his finger at her while telling her what she can and can t say on her own show. Trump is not a sexual predator! You can t say that!  Gingrich lectured, despite the fact that Kelly pointed out that she wasn t taking a position. But Gingrich continued his tirade and verbally assaulted Kelly. I m sick and tired of people like you using language that s inflammatory that s not true! When you use the words, you took a position. And I think it s very unfair of you to do that, Megyn! I think that is exactly the bias people are upset by. Your defensiveness on this may speak volumes, sir,  Kelly replied. When the interview ended, Kelly told Gingrich to take his anger issues elsewhere to work on them.Here s the video via YouTube.To recap, Gingrich acted like a woman-hating asshole and Kelly was the adult in the room and put him in his place.Well, that didn t sit well with Trump adviser Dan Scavino, who insulted and threatened Kelly via Twitter. Shows she is totally biased against Mr. Trump & not very smart,  Scavino wrote in the first tweet.  Mr. Trump has long known!! .@NewtGingrich just destroyed @MegynKelly. Shows she is totally biased against Mr. Trump & not very smart. Mr. Trump has long known!!  Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) October 26, 2016And then he cryptically threatened that something would happen to Kelly after the election. Megyn Kelly made a total fool out of herself tonight- attacking Donald Trump,  he wrote.

Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) October 26, 2016It sounds like Scavino just threatened violence against a woman, which is totally in conflict with his position as director of development at the Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation, which is dedicated to ending domestic violence. If Scavino is still working at this foundation, he should lose his job immediately. Because making threats against a woman is deplorable.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The FBI Just Received A Voter Suppression Complaint That Will TERRIFY Trump,"The FBI has actually received a voter suppression complaint, but not against Hillary and the Democrats despite Trump s insistence that she s rigging the entire election. No this complaint was filed against Trump himself, and targets his dangerous requests that his followers monitor polling places on Election Day.The complaint comes from the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, and a memo on the complaint specifically states: Over the weekend, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed complaints against Donald Trump with the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and with the FBI Public Corruption Unit for violations of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which guarantees the right to vote for all citizens. The complaints were filed as a reaction to Donald Trump s call for his supporters to go out and  watch the polls,  which will prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote. Trump has repeatedly called for his followers to act as poll watchers to ensure that no in-person voter fraud happens (which is almost non-existent). One man even said that he was planning on engaging in racial profiling for the purpose of intimidating anyone who didn t  look  American (read: anyone who appeared to be Mexican or Syrian). His hope seems to be to weed out people who aren t allowed to vote by making them nervous.Scott Dworkin, who wrote the memo, went on to copy the words of the DCAT s complaint, which not only went to the FBI, but also went to the Department of Justice: This complaint is against Donald Trump and his campaign for voter intimidation and suppression nationally.  Trump has encouraged his supporters to  go over and watch  polling places, the implication being to instill fear specifically to minority communities in the inner cities.By encouraging his supporters to go out and watch polling places, Donald Trump is violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Dworkin details out how violence at Trump s rallies could be enough to frighten minority voters away from polling places if they know the same violent, racist bigots will be lurking. Nobody wants to try and cast a vote with someone who hates them standing over their shoulders.Dworkin also cites Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which states that nobody, regardless of their purpose, is allowed to try and threaten, intimidate, or coerce anybody trying to cast a ballot. Trump s so-called  poll watchers  will do exactly that, which is what Dworkin is worried about.The FBI and DOJ know what Trump says at his rallies. He s claimed that Hillary has undocumented immigrants coming in specifically to vote for her; he s claimed that polls should be carefully watched so nobody votes twice, and everyone attempting to vote is legally allowed to vote, and he screams repeatedly that the election will be rigged against him.So it s not like the DCAT is grasping at straws, trying to draw a picture that doesn t exist. It does. And Trump should be terrified of it. Read the full complaint below:Dcat FBI Vra Memo by Grant Stern on Scribd If you witness or experience any type of voter suppression or intimidation when you go to vote, call this number: 1-866-OUR-VOTE.

 Megyn Kelly Called Trump A ‘Predator’; What Newt Gingrich Said Next Was DISGUSTING (VIDEO),"It s Fox News, but that doesn t mean that everyone is blindly following Donald Trump. Anchor Megyn Kelly fell off the Trump train right about the time of the first Republican presidential debate of the season, after which Trump accused Kelly of having  blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,  all because she dared ask about Trump s history of sexism.It s been more than a year since that debate, and in that time, Trump the sexist has come front and center, especially after Trump was caught on a hot mic, saying that he likes to grab women  by the pussy,  and to confirm Trump s own words, nearly a dozen women are now accusing the self-described billionaire of sexual misconduct.Kelly, when interviewing Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich, suggested that Trump is a  sexual predator.  At that point, the interview went off the rails. Gingrich became very angry and said to Kelly,Kelly responded in the best way possible,  I m not fascinated by sex, but I am fascinated by the protection of women and what we are getting in the oval office. Every woman knows that when a man tells a woman she s  fascinated by sex,  he s not saying it in a way that means she d be welcome in Trump s locker room   not at all. When a man tells a woman she s  fascinated by sex,  especially in an argumentative context, he s calling her a whore. While that statement might not have the same bite in 2016 that it might have had when Gingrich was young, the intent is there. Gingrich is trying to discredit Kelly in the exact same way that Trump is trying to discredit his alleged victims. A woman liking sex is still used as a defense in rape trials. While men grabbing pussy, or talking about grabbing pussy, is just boys being boys. Women talking about sex is taboo and any woman who dares talk about sex deserve whatever they have coming to them.Believe it or not, that exchange was the most rational part. In the now familiar Trump tactic of  I know you are but what am I,  Gingrich went on to call Bill Clinton a  sexual predator.  He even tried subtly bullying Kelly into  say(ing) the words,  Bill Clinton sexual predator.' Kelly went on to say that on her show, they ve covered the Bill Clinton story and that she s interviewed Kathleen Willey, who has accused Clinton of rape (an accusation for which a grand jury found insufficient evidence).Here s the video:Gingrich has a grudge against Clinton, to be sure. If you recall, the former Speaker of the House was one of architects of the Clinton impeachment, which only served to boost Clinton s popularity while it seriously hurt Congress s.Ironically, Gingrich and the other two Speakers who presided during the impeachment investigation and trials, were all sexual predators. Dennis Hastert molested boys while a wrestling coach in Illinois and Bob Livingston had a string of affairs. Gingrich was cheating on his second wife. Before that, though, Gingrich earned the title of sexual predator, at least that s what he s accused of:One former aide describes approaching a car with Gingrich s daughters in hand, only to find the candidate with a woman, her head buried in his lap. The aide quickly turned and led the girls away. Another former friend maintains that Gingrich repeatedly made sexual advances to her when her husband was out of town. On one occasion, he visited under the guise of comforting her after the death of a relative, and instead tried to seduce her. In certain circles in the mid-1970s, Gingrich was developing a reputation as a ladies  man.Source: SalonOh, and he also served his first wife her divorce papers while she was recovering from cancer surgery. Yes, he and Trump are a perfect match.",News,"October 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Backstreet Boys Send Harsh Message To Trump For His Use Of Their Song (DETAILS),"If you ve at all been watching the news coverage of Donald Trump rallies lately, you ve likely noticed the use of an upbeat pop song from the late 1990s. For some reason or another, the Trump campaign is using the Backstreet Boys  I Want It That Way. Well, guess what? Just like with pretty much every other artist that has asked Trump to stop using their music, so are the Backstreet Boys. They don t want to be associated, whatsoever, with his campaign.According to Steven Trachtenbroit, a publicist for the group: [The Backstreet Boys] did not approve this and we are not associated with the Trump camp. That statement was issued on October 12th. Yet, the Trump campaign can still be heard playing that song at rallies. It s become pretty obvious that Trump has no respect for the music he s using nor the artists who created it. This pretty much keeps in line with his inability to honor contracts and respect, well, anyone.When music is used, it gives the implication that the artist and musicians that created the music approve of the message being delivered by any particular candidate.You ll often hear Hillary Clinton use Katy Perry or Sara Bareilles, but they have both openly come out in support of Hillary, and clearly don t have a problem with the former Secretary of State utilizing their songs.Unfortunately for Trump, he s pretty much left with the music of Kid Rock and Ted Nugent if he wants to find music to play at his rallies.It comes down to asking permission and/or when asked to stop using music, to actually stop using the music. Trump is so quick to sue, but doesn t seem to think the same rules apply to him. This is yet another reason he needs to be kept as far away from the White House as possible.Featured Photo by Ethan Miller, Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Richard Branson: Trump Came To Me Broke And Vowing Revenge On Those Who Wouldn’t Give Him Money,"We all know Trump is vindictive. If he wasn t, he wouldn t be threatening lawsuits against everyone under the sun, and promising to change libel laws so it s easier to sue media outlets that dare to report bad things about him (even if they re true). At a private lunch, years ago, when Richard Branson was expecting to just talk with Trump about whatever over lunch, it turned out that all Trump could talk about was his bankrupt companies and the people who d refused to help him financially.In an interview on CNN, Branson flat-out said: It was just the two of us. I was expecting an interesting lunch talking about various things in the world.And instead I got a lunch where all he talked about was his bankrupt companies. Then Trump said that he d tried to get help from five different people, all of whom had told him, more or less, to go fuck himself. Branson then said what Trump had planned for those people: And then he spent the rest of this lunch telling me how he was going to spend the rest of his life destroying those five people. He s also hell bent on destroying any press outlets, like The New York Times, that won t make him look good. And he s obsessed with destroying the women who have accused him of sexual assault, because they aren t helping him either.Maybe Trump had lunch with Branson because he was hoping Branson would help him out financially? Branson is only the 288th wealthiest person in the world, but Trump is 335th, according to Forbes. That s this year. Several years ago, when this lunch took place, Trump may have been in considerably worse shape. Certainly his companies were in terrible shape.Branson went on to say that Trump s vindictive nature is dangerous for America. In fact, he couldn t believe that such a vengeful and petty man would even get this far in a presidential election. He s hoping he can get through to people who think Trump is wonderful, and will be good for America and the world.Trump is not a good man.Photo of Richard Branson by Mike Coppola via Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival.

 ‘I Don’t Rent To N*****s’: Smoking Gun Proves Trump Family Racism (VIDEO),"New video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants.As part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties.In the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him  I don t rent to the n-word,  and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy.The revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trump s run-in with the federal government over discrimination.Undercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties.One bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a  C  on the documents for  colored,  and that was a sign that they should be denied.The Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing.Donald Trump s involvement with his father s business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his father s $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organization s history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away   it s still there.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Freaks Out, Talks ‘World War Three’ (VIDEO)","Donald Trump, increasingly desperate as the election begins to slip away, has begun simply making up nightmare scenarios that he claims would occur if Hillary Clinton wins the upcoming presidential election. Speaking to Reuters, Trump said Clinton  has no plan for Syria  and  with her you ll end up in World War Three.  He went on to claim that the former Secretary of State  doesn t know what she s doing  and would be unprepared to lead if elected President.Yet despite Trump s criticism, he is the one who has been on record during the entirety of the campaign expressing extreme views about national security and foreign policy. Declaring that he  loves  war, Trump has promised to  bomb the hell  out of ISIS, torture America s enemies (even though experts say that increases danger and terrorism), and vowed to commit war crimes by killing the families of terrorists.As a result, Trump has seen an unprecedented backlash against his campaign. Many foreign policy experts who served under previous Republican presidents   George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush   now back Clinton and oppose Trump, because they believe he would be an erratic leader with access to America s gigantic nuclear arsenal and military.For her part, Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama have repeatedly made clear that with their experience in proximity to major crises that Trump would not have the mettle to make calm and level headed decisions. Clinton has cited Trump s habit of making Twitter tirades at three o clock in the morning as evidence that he has disqualified himself.Arguing without merit that Clinton would trigger World War III while polling shows that Trump at best has between a 9% to 15% chance at winning enough electoral votes to become President will not help the negative perceptions held about him amongst the public at large.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" AUDIO: Hannity Has RACIST Meltdown, Wants To Send President Obama And His Family Back To Africa","Nobody would have ever said this about any of our previous presidents. Nobody.But because President Obama and his family are black, Fox News host Sean Hannity is trying to get in as much hateful racist talk as possible before the Obamas leave the White House in January.And when President Obama leaves office, Hannity is offering to arrange for a one-way trip to Kenya for him and his family in response to a non-response the White House had to a satirical article claiming that Obama wants to move to Canada if Donald Trump wins the election on November 8th. Remember how Democrats insisted last week that we all need to be united behind whoever wins the election?  Hannity began.  Well, I guess that only applies if Donald Trump loses because apparently the president cannot bring himself to say that he ll unite behind the Trump presidency. Hannity talked about how  a White House aide failed to deny rumors that President Barack Obama was planning to leave the United States if Trump wins the election,  and then offered to send President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, and their two daughters to Africa as long as they don t come back. I ll pay   hang on a second, I m offering   I ll even rent a plane as big as Air Force One. [ ] I have an offer for the president. I will charter a plane for you and your family. I will make sure it s as big a plane as Air Force One, what you have grown accustomed to, in other words. Taxpayer-funded plane. I don t know where I m going to get  Maybe I ll just   Maybe I ll ask Trump if I can charter his plane for Obama. That s what   I will charter Donald Trump s plane if he ll let me, and I will charter it to the country of your choice. You want to go to Canada? I ll pay for you to go to Canada. You want to go to Kenya? I ll pay for you to go to Kenya. Jakarta, where you went to school back in the day, you can go back there. Anywhere you want to go. I m gonna   I ll put the finest food, caviar, champagne, you name it. I have one stipulation: you can t come back. That s fair. Here s the audio via YouTube.First of all, President Obama has already stated that he will peacefully transfer the presidency to Donald Trump in January should he actually win on Election Day. In fact, President Obama will even attend the inauguration.Second, every president in the modern era has had full use of Air Force One no matter where they go during their presidency. And it has always been taxpayer funded. Even when George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan took those 880 days of vacation during their presidencies combined while President Obama has only taken 217 days of vacation. So if Hannity wants to pretend that President Obama is somehow freeloading off of the taxpayers by using Air Force One, he should probably get all of the facts first.Furthermore, President Obama was NOT born in Kenya. His father was, but President Obama was born in Hawaii to an American mother and is a natural-born American citizen. His wife Michelle and their daughters were also born in the United States.Hannity s offer is disrespectful and hearkens back to a time when racists wanted to send blacks back to Africa just to keep America white.Fox News should be embarrassed that this jackass is still on their payroll, much less on their airwaves.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Alt-righter Gives DISGUSTING Reason Why ‘White Baby Boom’ Will Happen Under President Trump (TWEETS),"Matt Forney has an awfully disturbing prediction for what might happen as a result of Republican nominee Donald Trump running for office, and it shows just how devastatingly stupid and delusional conservatives are.Forney is an alt-right radio host who recently predicted that there s going to be what he calls a  white baby boom  after the election is over, because apparently  women are having sex dreams  about Trump. On Monday, Forney sent out a tweet that made fun of something Cosmopolitan writer Laura Beck had said when she explained that Trump s sexual assault allegations and lewd commentry about groping women had been impacting her sex life  something that many women in America can relate to at this very moment. On one hand, the thought of being touched by my husband, a man, after spending day upon never-ending day listening to Donald Trump s sexually assaultive language, is not a pleasant one. On the other, we are both so obsessed with the election that our combined anxiety is killing our sex drives. Forney decided to make the pain of American women a complete mockery when he said: I fully endorse shitlibs not having sex due to Trump, it makes them less likely to breed. TwitterForney then followed that tweet up by saying that women were actually aroused by Trump s misogynistic campaign! He wrote: [I]n my experience though, the majority of white women are having sex dreams about Trump, expect a white baby boom after he takes office. TwitterFortunately, Twitter users were more than happy to jump on Forney and set him straight.TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTo suggest that women are actually INTO a disgusting man that has degraded, assaulted and insulted them over his entire lifetime is absolutely repulsive. This election, every woman needs to get out and vote to shut this moron down!Featured image via Twitter and Scott Olson / Getty Images",News,"October 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s ‘Condolences’ To Grieving Star Were ALL About Wanting To F*ck Her,"Trump has no compassion, and he has no empathy. He only focuses on himself, which is proven with a blog post of supposed  condolences,  to Hollywood star Kelly Preston after her son died from a seizure in 2009. His mind is so warped he couldn t even say,  I m sorry for your loss,  without first going into detail about how he tried to get Preston into his bed, along with bragging about his  outstanding record  on bedding beautiful women: A long time ago, before I was married, I met Kelly Preston at a club and worked like hell to try and pick her up. She was beautiful, personable, and definitely had allure. At the time I had no idea she was married to John Travolta.In any event, my track record on this subject has always been outstanding, but Kelly wouldn t give me the time of day. She was very nice, very elegant, but I didn t have a chance with her, and that was that. Seriously. That was the first thing he said in the he dedicated to her on Trump U. s site. Only when he was done talking about trying to have sex with her, and how great he is at getting women to have sex with him, did he finally get around to actually saying what ought to be said in such letters: When I later found out she was married to John, I liked and respected her even more. Some people have values that matter to them, and she is one of them. Her loyalty was unwavering and I have always remembered that about her.Being true to someone is very close to being true to yourself. That s a valuable attribute in today s world. I m sure she was a wonderful mother to Jett and my thoughts are with her and her family after their terrible loss. He could have left  When I later found out she was married to John,  out, along with the sheer insensitivity that was the first two paragraphs, but his ego wouldn t let him. He should have simply said that he knew, liked and respected her as someone who was true to her values, and he was sorry for her terrible loss. The fact that he couldn t is yet another a clear window into the way he thinks about women.Of course, ever since the  Access Hollywood  tape came out, we ve all been more acutely aware than ever that Trump is nothing more than a womanizing sexual predator who believes he s entitled to the, ahem, company of beautiful women. Any remaining delusion any sane person had that this man-boy actually has a heart, though, is now destroyed.This man-child is a piece of primordial slime through to his core.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images",News,"October 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Texas Judge Leaves Republican Party In EPIC Video Ripping Trump And GOP,"Donald Trump s vitriol and sexism just made a Texas judge leave the Republican Party, and she announced her departure on video.The exodus from the GOP continues as yet another Republican has decided to jump off the sinking ship that Republican leaders nominated Trump to helm.Judge Lauren Parish announced and explained her decision while seated in her seat at the 115th Judicial District Court, where she works. It is with a heavy heart that I have watched as the Republican nominee for president has made a mockery of our country and our citizenry,  she began. I have watched in horror as he has disavowed our military heroes, made fun of the disabled, divided our country along racial, religious and gender lines, mocked the judicial branch of government, expounded untruth after untruth, promoted violence and disrespect, boasted about sexual assault against women, and made vitriol the platform of his campaign.In short, my family values, my Christian value, my core beliefs have been disenfranchised by my party s nominee for president. Therefore, after much thought and deliberation I have decided that it would violate my conscience to continue to be a member of the Republican Party. Parish explained that she has seen Trump s hate and incivility trickle into local politics and she is sick of it. Quite frankly, I can no longer be affiliated with a party that could tolerate such antagonism and hatred,  Parish continued.  I can no longer sit idly by while this abhorrent disease continues to infect what was once a respectable and honorable political party of the past. The Grand Old Party of Lincoln no longer exists today. Parish explained that she was taught to love her neighbor and to build people up instead of tearing them down. And she refuses to sacrifice her values and beliefs just because the Republican Party is abandoning their own. I announce today that the current national Republican Party has abandoned all the principles instilled in me by my parents, my church and my community. As a result, I can no longer tolerate being affiliated with the current Republican Party. I see no way of reconciling my Christian beliefs with the manner in which the national Republican party is conducting itself. As of today, I am resigning my affiliation with the Republican Party. Here s the video via YouTube.[ad3media campaign= 1235 ]The reality that Republicans are leaving the party in Texas is huge because the state has slowly become a battleground state since Trump won the nomination. The race there is so tight, in fact, that Hillary Clinton is only down by three points. So Texas could very well be in play, and it s because moderate Republicans can no longer stomach Trump being the leader of their party.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video ",News,"October 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Just Secured The Most Important GOP #NeverTrump Endorsement YET,"Colin Powell is a Republican, but he voted for our beloved President Obama twice, and now he is again angering the nutty wing of his party by refusing to stand by the disgraceful 2016 GOP nominee that is Donald Trump. He s gone even further than that, though, and has endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Now, considering Powell s voting habits of the last eight years, one could argue that he is just a RINO at this point (Republican In Name Only). But, we must remember   he was Secretary of State under President George W. Bush. You don t get much more traditionally Republican than that. On the other hand, he is a smart, reasonable human being who loves his country and has served it proudly in a prestigious and celebrated military career, rising all the way up the ranks to become a General in the United States Army.Powell s revelation comes after leaked emails revealed that he views Donald Trump as a  national disgrace.  To that end, one would expect that General Powell would want nothing to do with today s version of the party he has been a proud member of for so long.This is the biggest blow yet to Donald Trump and the GOP writ large, considering how respected Colin Powell is in this great nation, regardless of party affiliations or political leanings. This is especially powerful considering that we are now exactly two weeks from Election Day. This is a great sign that Americans will do the right thing, and to reject the bigotry, misogyny, and demagoguery that is Donald Trump.As for the Republican-elected officials that continue to stand behind Trump   shame on you. You know in your heart of hearts that the last place that orange buffoon belongs is anywhere near the Oval Office, and yet you continue to do all you can to put him there.Featured image via Hillary Clinton s Instagram",News,"October 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BUSTED: Wisconsin Clerk Gets Caught Trying To Rig The Election For Trump,"Donald Trump keeps claiming that the election is rigged. Well, he s right, only it s the Republicans who are doing the rigging.Wisconsin has one of the most restrictive voting laws in the nation, which Republicans have bragged would hurt Hillary Clinton in the state.The courts have ordered clerks to set up more polling locations to cut down on voting time and the long lines that plagued the state primary. But Green Bay city clerk Kris Teske, who was appointed by Republican mayor and Scott Walker stooge, Jim Schmitt, tried to get around both the court order and a request from Democratic State Rep. Eric Genrich to put a polling location near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay to make it easier for students to vote.Teske wrote an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission in an effort to get out of doing so, arguing that not only would it cost money and require resources, but it would help Democrats in the upcoming election on November 8th. I don t like the idea at all for many reasons: Staffing, ballot security, budget, etc.,  she began. I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats. Teske literally just argued for not setting up an additional polling place for students because she thinks they lean more toward voting for Democrats.That s the textbook definition of voter suppression and election rigging.Just imagine if a city clerk decided that churches can t be polling places because religious people lean more toward voting for Republicans. Or that we can t put polling places in rural areas because rural areas lean Republican. Republicans would be crying foul and throwing a temper tantrum over it.Kris Teske should be removed from her position immediately if a polling location is not placed where Rep. Genrich requested. Whether or not more students voting benefits Democrats is beside the point and that shouldn t be the position of a nonpartisan city clerk,  Genrich told The Nation.  I don t know what Kris s politics are, but it s really unfortunate to see her echoing the sentiments of Republicans in Wisconsin, who have been making it really difficult for citizens to vote in this state. We should be working hard to make sure everyone gets to vote in this country. Anything less should be considered criminal.Featured Image: Ethan Miller via Getty Images",News,"October 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Racist Fox Host Celebrates The ‘Good News’ That Black Votes Are Down (VIDEO),"After watching their Republican nominee insult nearly every minority living in America, conservatives know just how dangerous the non-white vote is in this election. As minorities make up more and more of the general population, Donald Trump has put the Republican Party at an incredible disadvantage with his divisive, racist rhetoric.So when Fox News host Bill Hemmer celebrated some interesting news on Tuesday, it became more obvious than ever that the GOP considers the minority vote a major threat to the future of its party. Fox News host Bill Hemmer actually said that he had  good news  in Ohio, which was that more white people were voting in the state and the black share of the vote is down. At this point in the election, when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is beating Donald Trump by a landslide, Republicans are grasping at straws and desperately trying to find the silver lining in anything they possibly can. Hemmer said to RNC Communications Director Sean Spicer: I m looking at early voting. You have good news in Ohio, white share of the vote is up 3 points from four years ago, black share of the vote is down 7. Spicer seemed just as giddy about this news, and also noted that the Republican Party was leading in absentee ballots. He echoed Hemmer s excitement when he said,  Our people are coming out. You can watch this despicable exchange below, in which two white men celebrate the fact that their data shows racists having the upper hand:[ad3media campaign= 1234 ]Republicans are going to be awfully disappointed at the end of this election, and November 8th can t come soon enough. Despite what conservatives want to believe, America isn t nearly as white as it used to be, and minority voters have great power now.

 WATCH: President Obama ZINGS The Hell Out Of Trump On Jimmy Kimmel,"One of the more popular segments on  Jimmy Kimmel Live  is  Celebrities Read Mean Tweets.  Sometimes Kimmel runs special editions, like sports editions, film editions, creator editions, and more. Last night, Kimmel had President Obama on his show to read mean tweets   the second time that Obama has done that. Most of the tweets are pretty standard, vanilla hate, right up until the end, when he gets to a tweet from none other than one Donald J. Trump.Trump takes potshots at Obama all the time on Twitter   that s nothing new. His Twitter feed is a cesspool of self-congratulations, pseudo-gratitude for his loyal subjects, and insults at everyone who bothers him. The tweet that Obama read said: President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States! It was Obama, though, who got the last laugh on that one with a truth that the Donald will never acknowledge: Really? Well, @realDonaldTrump, at least I will go down as a president. Bam!

 Obama Says Blame The Donald: Trump Is Such An A**hole That Michelle HAD To Hit The Campaign Trail,"Michelle Obama is arguably the strongest weapon Hillary Clinton s campaign has when it comes to fighting Donald Trump. And according to President Obama, the GOP nominee has no one but himself to thank for her presence on the campaign trail.Speaking at a fundraiser for Clinton in California on Monday, Obama said there is one force driving the first lady to fight tooth and nail for Clinton: The possibility of a Trump presidency. Some of you may be aware of the fact that Michelle does not really love politics,  Obama said.  But the passion that she s brought to campaigning this time speaks to the degree that this election is different, the choice is different. Obama said that when he was running against Sen. john McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, he disagreed with them about many, many things. But despite that, he still considered them to be  honorable people. I wasn t concerned about the Republic if they had won,  Obama said.  And so part of the reason Michelle is working the way she is, is because she understands, as I understand, that some more fundamental values are at stake in this election. It has to do with our basic standards of decency   how do we treat people. The president said that for the FLOTUS, the choices we are faced with in the 2016 election can be boiled down to this: Do we treat people who are of a different faith as part of the fabric of America, or do we label them as something foreign, not a  real American,  and thereby subject to different standards when it comes to how our laws apply? And this:  Do we think of women as equal and full citizens, capable of doing anything, or do we think of them as objects of either scorn or lust or our own satisfactions? Do we think that government is something serious, that we have an obligation to make sure that to the best of our abilities we leave the country a little bit better off than how we found it, or do we think that it s an infomercial or a reality TV show,  Obama continued.All of this has made one thing very clear to the first lady:  Michelle s conclusion is, is that we can t have [Trump] in the Oval Office,  Obama said.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"October 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump In For TREMENDOUS Shock If He Thinks He Can Just Refuse To Accept Election Night Loss,"Trump has been very clear for the last week or so   he will not accept the results of Election Night if he s not the winner. He even said at a rally in Ohio: I would like to promise and pledge, to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election   if I win. He also told Chris Wallace, the moderator of the final presidential debate, that he will keep us all in suspense until Election Night is over. And he s made noises about contesting the results if Hillary wins, presumably because there s no way  Crooked Hillary  could win in his world.He s in for a shocker, though. Election law doesn t really allow a candidate to just contest election results because he s butthurt over losing. We have 43 states that allow losing candidates to call for recounts, and half of those have  trigger margins,  where a recount is automatically triggered when the vote is within those margins.They re typically very narrow, though. If Trump is hoping that automatic recounts will be triggered in some of the battleground states, he will probably be badly disappointed. If he thinks he can just say,  I don t like the results in that state, please recount,  because he thinks that s what Al Gore did in 2000, he s got another think coming. Despite that, he s actually said: If Al Gore and George Bush had agreed three weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case. I m being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters. The truth there is that Florida s results were so close that their automatic recount was triggered. That, in turn, led to the longest, most annoying dramatic presidential election imaginable.Electoral votes are sent on to the Senate for certification in early January, and then the Senate President, who s actually Joe Biden, signs off. It s not likely that very many in Congress will want to help draw out Trump s drama if the election s results are clear in their view (which very well could be different from  clear  in Trump s view).Trump has taken a ton of flak for his cries of  RIGGED!  and for his statements that he might not accept the results if he loses. That could be true even if he loses bigly, despite his claims of being willing to accept a clear result. He ll no doubt make noises about sending investigators to all the battleground states that went to Hillary to check for the widespread fraud he ll be sure gave her the win. He won t concede, which many don t like. Even Sen. John McCain, who lost to Obama in 2008 and had to swallow that loss and give a concession speech, says: I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance. A concession isn t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader s first responsibility. Trump isn t a leader, though. He s a narcissistic toddler who plans on screaming and crying and stomping his feet in front of all of America on Nov. 8 if he loses. He ll have so much fun watching Paul Ryan, possibly alongside Mitch McConnell, give his concession speech for him.Featured image by Mark Makela via Getty Images",News,"October 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Period.Wesley Dylan Marshall is probably only going to serve 75 percent of a ridiculous 10 day jail sentence for what he did to a 19-year-old woman this past July.During a stay at the Church Hill Motel with the woman and another man, Marshall became angry and assaulted the woman by literally throwing her off the side of a balcony two stories high because she consented to having sex with the other man and not him in celebration of her birthday.According to the Kingsport Times-News,Aside from the jail time and anger management classes, Marshall was sentenced to 11 months and 29 days of probation, ordered to serve 96 hours of community service, issued fines and fees totaling $1,237 and ordered to have no contact with the victim.It all adds up to yet another light sentence for a white guy who committed violence against a woman, proving once again that the judicial system and the law does not go far enough to protect women from assholes like Marshall.Judges across the country have disgraced themselves by sentencing rapists and abusers to light sentences.In June, Judge Aaron Persky sentenced rapist Brock Turner to only six months in jail, igniting a firestorm of criticism.In August, Colorado Judge Patrick Butler gave a rapist ZERO prison time.A Massachusetts judge did the same thing during the same month and even gave the perpetrator permission to serve his probation in another state so he can attend college.And a Montana judge is facing impeachment for sentencing a man to just 60 days in jail for raping his own daughter.This latest sentencing in Tennessee is just adding to the pattern.Clearly, there are far too many judges in this country who have a frat boy attitude about the way white guys treat women and it s only getting worse.Featured Image: Raw Story",News,"October 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Eric Trump: My Dad ‘Has Carried The Weight Of This Country For The Last 18 Months’ (VIDEO),"Eric Trump, the son of the GOP presidential nominee, told George Stephanopoulos on ABC This Week that his father  has carried the weight of this country for the last 18 months.  Donald is so brave to do that for America and for freedom. Except, he certainly hasn t carried the weight of this country for minorities, the LGBTQ community, veterans, the handicapped and women. In fact, everything Donald has done during the last 18 months has been for Donald.Conspiracy theorist Donald Trump took to his Twitter account today to say that,  Major story that the Dems are making up phony polls in order to suppress the the Trump . We are going to WIN! Major story that the Dems are making up phony polls in order to suppress the the Trump . We are going to WIN!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2016Stephanopoulos brought up Donald s sinking poll numbers to Eric. The polling average shows about a 7 to 8 .,  the ABC host said.Eric said,  Look at the  L.A. Times  poll. We re up by 2 points. The  IBD  Poll, we re up by 2 points. The Rasmussen, we re up by a few points. So, you know, the polls are all over the place. And, in fact, there was a poll, and it was a Reuters Poll that came out this morning,  he continued.  There was two states, Minnesota and Michigan that were within the margin of error. I mean these states haven t been run   won by a Republican in 30 years, so. By the way, Ramussen predicted a landslide victory for Mitt Romney in 2012. Let s ask President Romney how well that worked out. So you don t think you re fighting from behind right now?  Stephanopoulos asked.Eric said,  Maybe   listen, maybe, but I can tell you, when I m on the ground, the amount of love out there is   is incredible. Eric continued to say that Democrats have told him they are voting for his father and that he has union support. Most polls do show most Democrats going for Hillary Clinton right now,  Stephanopoulos shot back.  Do you think you might be living in   in   in a bubble of your own support? Eric said he didn t think so and went on to say that his father had 10,000 people in Cleveland  at the rally. To me, as a son, he wins no matter what. I mean I m so incredibly proud,  Eric said. I mean he s carried the weight of this country for the last 18 months. I happen to think we re going to win. I mean when I m in these states   and I just came back from North Carolina and I just came back from Ohio. Eric went on to mention how many yard signs he s spotted that support his father. You don t see a single Hillary sign. I mean the enthusiasm differential between the two candidates is just   it   it s not even   it s not even close,  he said.  And I think you re going to see that on election day. Watch:As one Twitter user pointed out to Eric, Americans have been carrying Donald for 18 years by paying taxes. But according to Eric, just like Jesus carried a cross, Donald has carried the weight of this country on his shoulders for 18 months.Image via screen capture.",News,"October 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Tin-Pot Tyrant Trump Thinks The First Amendment Goes TOO FAR (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is all about free speech, as long as it means that he can verbally abuse anyone who gets in his way without having to pay consequences. Unfortunately, for Trump, though, the media, whose job it is to vet presidential candidates, isn t always sympathetic to his verbal tirades and his twitterrhea. He wants to put a stop to that.In an interview with Miami s WFOR, Trump was asked by the reporter if it should be easier to sue media and whether the First Amendment provides  too much protection. Trump didn t specifically say  yes,  but he did talk about England.Well in England they have a system where you can actually sue if someone says something wrong. Our press is allowed to say whatever they want and get away with it. And i think we should go to a system where if they do something wrong  I m a big believer tremendous believer of the freedom of the press. Nobody believes it stronger than me but if they make terrible, terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people. I m not just talking about me I m talking anybody else then yes, i think you should have the ability to sue them.Here s the video:Let s recap that for a moment. Trump says,  if they make terrible, terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people. I m not just talking about me I m talking anybody else then yes, i think you should have the ability to sue them. We already have that system in place. Trump literally described libel laws. Unfortunately for him, though, public figures, especially those running for public office, have a much harder time winning a libel suit, although if a publication knowingly writes incorrect and damaging information, he can sue.The problem for Trump, though, is that the media hasn t lied about him. They quote him directly, which for a man who clearly can t control what comes out of his mouth, is a problem.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images.",News,"October 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Top Lawyers Go After Trump, Offer To Defend His Accusers FOR FREE (TWEETS)","We all know that man-baby Donald Trump hates the First Amendment when it doesn t favor him, so you can only imagine how upset he is that women are using their freedom of speech to accuse him of sexually assaulting them. As more and more allegations have come to the surface, the Republican nominee has promised to sue these women when the election is over   as if he hasn t made them suffer through enough.Fortunately, Trump s threat to sue has attracted the attention of a few prominent First Amendment attorneys, who have recently come forward and said they would defend Trump s victims against him, pro bono! One of these high-profile lawyers is Ted Boutrous of the law firm Gibson Dunn, who tweeted that he would defend these women for free earlier this month.TwitterOn Saturday, Trump repeated his threat to file lawsuits against his accusers, and Boutrous once again renewed his commitment to going up against Trump. He even noted that since his announcement, several other lawyers were interested in joining his cause.TwitterOne of these attorneys is actually Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, who Boutrous thanked for his interest.Twitter TwitterIt looks like Trump is going down, even if he tries to somehow save himself! Trump has put his accusers through hell, and he continues to (poorly) discredit their numerous allegations and trash them in the media. As if these women haven t already been through enough, the help of these attorneys will certainly make all the difference as they go up against one of the most vile human beings American history has ever seen. The only thing more wonderful than seeing Trump lose to Hillary Clinton in November would be seeing Trump behind bars for the numerous rapes and fraudulent activities he s committed over his lifetime.Featured image via Brian Blanco / Getty Images",News,"October 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sean Hannity Just Got OWNED By George W. Bush’s CIA Director,"Sean Hannity openly supports Donald Trump for president and has turned his media platform into the Republican nominee s propaganda machine.Indeed, Hannity is Trump s chief propagandist and there is no low that he won t sink to in order to attack Hillary Clinton and defend Trump.Of course, Hannity denies that he s a propagandist, but if anyone knows what a propagandist looks like, it s the CIA and former CIA Director Michael Hayden says Hannity is a  true propagandist. After years of bashing Wikileaks and the group s founder Julian Assange, Hannity has just recently began praising them because they are releasing private emails from Hillary Clinton s campaign team.Wikileaks obtained these emails by illegally hacking servers in the United States, which constitutes foreign espionage against this country. But Sean Hannity is cheering them on anyway in what amounts to endorsing crimes against the United States.And Hayden ripped Hannity and Fox News a new one for doing so in a response to Brookings Institute senior fellow Benjamin Wittes. FOXNews has almost completely jumped the shark,  Hayden wrote.  They have given up any semblance of conservatism and focused on an almost visceral hatred of all things Clinton and Obama. Hannity has entered the pantheon of a true propagandist. And his behavior reminds me of a conversation I had with a political office in the mid-1980s when I was the air attach  to Bulgaria. I asked this officer what truth was to him. He responded without hesitation,  Truth is what serves the party.  And there you have it.

 Donald Trump Is Going To HATE What The NY Times Published This Morning,"If you needed more proof that Donald Trump is a toxic hateful bully, there s a two-page spread in the New York Times you need to read.On Monday, the New York Times published every single insult Trump has made on Twitter against every person, place, or thing since he threw his hat in the presidential race in June 2015.And it s such a long list that it take up a full two pages.Wow Today s @nytimes features a 2-page spread of all the people, places & things Trump has insulted on Twitter since declaring his candidacy pic.twitter.com/eDzwZNIjkF  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) October 24, 2016Among the people, places, and things the Republican nominee has insulted includes the United States, Saturday Night Live, Saudi Arabia, Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski, the TSA, reporter Katy Tur, sexual assault victims, Megyn Kelly, CNN, Ted Cruz, the Republican Party, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, China, immigrants, a book about William McKinley, and more. The list goes on and on.No president in the history of this country has ever been this hateful. This list could also very well be the first of its kind and it s about a major presidential candidate.Trump and the Republican Party should be embarrassed. Donald Trump has disgraced himself over and over again but his supporters still continue to back him.But Twitter users pointed out a few things about this list.@brandonwojo I think what s more important is how LONG that list is.

 Trump’s Economic Plans Just Got A HUGE Black Eye From Conservative Economists,"Economists, even conservative ones, have severe problems with Trump s economic policies. They re unrealistic, and he doesn t know what he s talking about according to both liberal and conservative economists. Trump has made a point of not listening to the experts, but the experts know what they re talking about far better than Trump ever will.Stan Veuger, from the conservative American Enterprise Institute, was very forthright in his opinion of Trump s ahem economic policy: He doesn t really know what he s talking about, and his policy platform is so incoherent that he has to make claims like that. It sounds like Veuger thinks Trump is making grandiose promises specifically to cover up the fact that he doesn t have a sane economic plan. Knowing Trump, that s exactly what he s doing. It also sounds like Veuger finds it frustrating that Trump won t listen to any experts.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody s Analytics, and someone both Trump and Hillary have claimed is batting for  the other team,  gave The Hill his own summary of his analysis of Trump s plan, saying: His growth expectations are not realistic. The economy s potential growth is 2 percent, and to get stronger growth will require immigration reform that provides a path to legalization for the undocumented and a significant increase in skilled legal immigration. He is strongly opposed to this. Trump has bragged that he can increase our GDP from its current 1.4 percent to 4, 5 or even 6 percent, which is just flat ridiculous. He s also adamantly opposed to giving undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship and, in fact, wants to create a deportation force to get rid of them. He thinks that will open up jobs for Americans and get our economy booming again, but that s a pipe dream.His strong nationalism has made him opposed to allowing more immigrants in, even legally. He believes they ll take Americans  jobs, and he s afraid they could be dangerous, too.Trump believes that the economic growth he s promising will pay for the tax cuts he s promising, but it won t happen that way. Zandi says that these plans will cripple the economy and federal revenue. Of course, Trump won t listen, because reasons. What s clear, though, is that the experts who know better than Trump are growing bolder in trashing his concept of economics.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",News,"October 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Unearthed 2012 Trump Interview Shows A COMPLETE 180 On Immigration Policy (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a liar. He will do and say anything in his never-ending quest for more and more money and power. This is never thrown into sharper relief than buy the extreme shifts in policy positions since he decided to run for president as a Republican. In doing so, Trump read the tea leaves when it comes to what it takes to appeal to the bigoted GOP base. The first thing he had to do was convince them that he hates immigrants   particularly those of the brown variety just as much as they do.

 MAJOR Trump Donor Says Rape is Just ‘Regret’,"Very few people with significant money or power in this country are voting for Donald Trump. Even the Koch brothers are publicly backing off supporting the toxic, self-described billionaire. One Silicon Valley billionaire is happy to be on the Trump train, even after the allegations of sexual assault surfaced. Perhaps that s because PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, who is also a Facebook investor and a $1.25 million Trump donor, doesn t really think sexual assault is a big deal.In 1995, Thiel wrote a book called  The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus.  If you think that sounds like a Trump-esque screed against political correctness, you d be right.The book isn t just about saying offensive words or about cultural appropriation. According to The Guardian s article on it, Thiel complained that in many cases, complaints of date rape were just regret by the victims.In a case about a 17-year-old Stanford freshman who said she was raped in a dorm room while drunk, Thiel and his cowriter and PayPal partner, David O. Sacks, wrote: Although [the alleged perpetrator] was clearly guilty of serving alcohol to an underage woman and taking advantage of her resulting lack of judgement, there was no sexual assault   Understandably, however, the woman regretted the whole incident afterwards. This argument has never made sense to me. In rape cases, the benefit of the doubt always goes with the accused rapist. A rape victim opens herself up to slander, to character assassination and to accusations exactly like the one above. Wouldn t the more logical response to regret to be to deny it ever happened?Thiel also believes that rape necessarily involves physical injuries, which would mean that those influenced by date rape drugs would likely have no claim, at least in his perfect world. It is ludicrous to believe that anyone who had been forcefully violated would not know it and bear physical marks. Then, there s this, because you know, men are always the victims: The purpose of the rape crisis movement seems as much about vilifying men as about raising  awareness.' Thiel s book, as described in The Guardian, goes on to complain about the many ways whites, and white men in particular, are victimized and vilified in this country. Is it any wonder he is supporting Donald Trump?Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images.",News,"October 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Man Who Tried To Dictate What Women Can Wear Gets ROYALLY OWNED In His Own House,"Very little is more infuriating for women than to have our appearances policed. Yet, police us people do, usually by criticizing what s in fashion and calling it too immodest, and crying that men can t stop staring and thus are sinning in their hearts, or saying that women over a certain age should not wear this or that. One of the latest incidents comes from Alan Sorrentino, of Rhode Island, who wrote a letter to editor for EastBayRI saying women over 20 should not be wearing yoga pants in public.Yoga pants draw a lot of ire from the supposedly pious and the supposedly weak-willed. Sorrentino s specific targeting of women in yoga pants earned him a  yoga pants parade  through the street in front of his house. Hundreds of people men and women participated while wearing yoga pants.Yes, there were men wearing yoga pants to stand in solidarity with women who are tired of being told what they can and cannot wear, and paraded with women in front of Sorrentino s house. Sorrentino got more than an eyeful of the  struggles with physicality  that he doesn t want to see anymore: To all yoga pant wearers, I struggle with my own physicality as I age. I don t want to struggle with yours. Thanks. His problem is that, as women age, we lose our beauty and our bodies, which, to people like him, necessarily restrict what we can wear. It s like he thinks that if we re not young and beautiful, we should hide ourselves in some way (oh wait, that s exactly what he thinks): Like the mini-skirt, yoga pants can be adorable on children and young women who have the benefit of nature s blessing of youth. However, on mature, adult women there is something bizarre and disturbing about the appearance they make in public. Maybe it s the unforgiving perspective they provide, inappropriate for general consumption, TMI, or the spector [sic] of someone coping poorly with their weight or advancing age that makes yoga pants so weird in public.A nice pair of tailored slacks, jeans, or anything else would be better than those stinky, tacky, ridiculous looking yoga pants. They do nothing to compliment a women over 20 years old. In fact, the look is bad. Do yourself a favor, grow up and stop wearing them in public.  [emphasis mine]How disgusting. If someone is dressed or presenting an appearance we don t want to see, we can, you know, just look somewhere else. Or better yet, we can accept that there are things in this world that we personally would rather not see. Truly mature people, one of whom Sorrentino clearly isn t, recognize that it s not our place to tell other people what they can and cannot wear based on our personal comfort.Sorrentino is now claiming he wrote the letter as a joke, and the paper is defending its decision to publish it by explaining that they publish all opinions as long as they aren t attacking a person or a group: In this case, Mr. Sorrentino is not attacking any individual nor specific group. It s safe to assume that his comments target a large portion of America s female population, and that group obviously has ample firepower to respond to Mr. Sorrentino and his opinions. Telling women over 20 how they can and cannot dress isn t attacking women? Okay then. That s systemic sexism, though. Here s hoping the yoga pants parade got Sorrentino s attention, and he rethinks his position. Joke or not, it was inappropriate at best.Here s a short video from the parade:The #YogaPantsParade is underway @ABC6 pic.twitter.com/VItosLSLaA  Bianca Buono (@BBuonoABC6) October 23, 2016Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"October 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Latest Polls Show Hillary Could Win One Of The MOST Important Deep Red States,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has been steadily ripping the Republican Party apart at the seams due to the embarrassing travesty of a campaign he s been running. This is especially true since the surfacing of a tape of Trump and former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush having what is quite possibly the most lewd, offensive conversation two men could have about women. As if that weren t enough, nearly a dozen women have come forward claiming Trump did to them just what he bragged about being able to do on that tape.Trump s scandals are literally doing something that no one thought possible: Turning certain reliably red states into battleground states. According to the polling organization RealClearPolitics, Trump s lack of acceptability could actually turn TEXAS, of all places, blue. As of Sunday, Trump is within the margin of error   just three points ahead of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The average of all of the available polling is a 4.8 point divide. This is likely due to the fact that there are some things that are just not partisan   open misogyny, narcissism, racism, xenophobia, and all of the other characteristics that make for huge deal-breakers on the basis of basic decency, regardless of political leanings.Other red states that could be within striking distance for Hillary include Arizona, Utah and Georgia. This would be why Trump, who is simply unable to accept losing at anything, is now talking of a  rigged election.  It s an effort to make his already angry, disillusioned supporters become even more aggrieved. This makes for a dangerous situation, and therefore it is DEFINITELY a good thing if Hillary can not only win, but run up the score around the nation and completely annihilate Trump.Featured image via Justin Sullivan via Getty Images",News,"October 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: CNN Pundit Hilariously Turns Trump’s ‘Drain The Swamp’ Slogan Against Him,"Donald Trump will probably want to dump his new favorite slogan now.The Republican nominee has for talking for weeks about how he should be elected so he can  drain the swamp  in reference to the lawmakers and federal employees who work in Washington D.C., which was a swamp prior to being drained and used as the site of our nation s capital.The phrase has become the centerpiece of Trump s effort to persuade voters to support him on Election Day.But Trump s slogan alienates members of his own party since Republicans control the Senate and the House. And Trump s own running mate Mike Pence was a congressman for 12 years, which doubles the number of years Trump says he wants to limit members of Congress to serving.Yep, Donald Trump is literally turning the old conservative line that government needs to be cleaned out against them.And Tharon Johnson couldn t help but point that out during an appearance on CNN on Sunday along with Trump supporter Paris Dennard.. A running mate who spent 12 years in the Congress, was one of the most divisive members of Congress,  Johnson began before referencing Trump s Gettysburg speech. This guy was the sole person who led a crusade to try to defund Planned Parenthood. As my friend Paris said, before Donald Trump attempted to make a presidential statesman-like policy speech, he spent the first fifteen minutes attacking his accusers. So when he makes comments about how we should enforce term limits, term limits are left up to the voters. That s why most members of the House and Senate have elections two and six years. If someone is not effective then members will vote them out. And then Johnson took Trump s favorite new slogan and crushed it. Let me respond to this really comical comment about draining the swamp. It s so laughable to me. If you drain that swamp what you would find at the bottom of that swamp would be Donald Trump. You would see to the side of him his playbook of his campaign showing you how not to run a campaign to become president of the United States. Here s the video via YouTube.Sorry, Donald.

 Reince Priebus Does WEIRD Balancing Act Regarding Trump’s ‘Rigged Election’ Talk,"Donald Trump s recent talk of a  rigged election  is dangerous, as it undermines the trust of Americans in the electoral process. There has been bipartisan condemnation of his continuing to poison the minds of his brainwashed supporters. Elected officials and leadership on both sides of the political aisle have expressed confidence in the election results, and some have even gone on television to explain the process in great detail, to show just how impossible it is to rig a national level election. There seems to be one Trump supporter, though, who isn t being as forceful with regards to pushing back against this narrative: Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus.Priebus seems to be the only member of the GOP leadership who is closely helping the Trump campaign these days, and he seems to be afraid to anger Trump. On CBS s Face the Nation on Sunday, Priebus said to host John Dickerson with regards to Trump s willingness to concede if he loses: He s saying he wants to reserve all options, and  if there is grounds for a recount, I will exercise my options. He is not willing to not concede if he loses and there s no fraud. Dickerson reminded Priebus that Trump had told his supporters that fraud is the only way he could possibly lose Pennsylvania. Instead of taking the usual line that voter fraud is not widespread, Priebus said: That s not where we re at. Losing by 100 votes is one thing. Losing by 100,000 is another thing. Sure, there have been contested elections, but that is not what Trump has been saying to his rabid base of supporters. He has instead been telling them that there is a vast conspiracy, a huge, sweeping, nationwide effort to make sure he doesn t win. Party leaders like Priebus, whether they are in Trump s camp or not, have a responsibility to put a lid on this dangerous rhetoric. Instead, Priebus is giving shameful responses to something that could cause many, many problems indeed.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images ",News,"October 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Trump Supporter Admits What ‘Make America Great Again’ Means To Her, And It’s Vile","The reason why many conservatives support Donald Trump is because they literally think he will erase the last 60 years of American history.After the third and final debate on Wednesday night, Face The Nation host John Dickerson sat down with a group of Nevada voters at a restaurant and talked to them about the candidates.But when he talked to a woman named Barbara, you could the hypocrisy, ignorance, and bigotry in her eyes as she let her crazy flag fly for all to hear and see.Barbara told the CBS host that she is voting for Trump because she believes in  morality and values. Now, many of you probably laughed out loud when you read that because the last thing the Republican nominee represents is morality and values. Trump s words about groping women, his nods and winks to white supremacists, the multiple sexual assault allegations against him, the tapes of him hitting on underage girls, and all of the nasty remarks he has made about just about every group in America completely disqualifies him from having any claim to being the moral candidate.And Barbara demonstrated that by openly revealing herself as an anti-gay bigot because she thinks Trump will take the nation back to a time when homosexuals were persecuted and women s reproductive rights were controlled exclusively by men, a time she claims the founding fathers approved of. Based on what the country was based on, I think that the laws that Obama has passed, the way the country has   I call it down turning. Some of the other people are proud of it and happy for it. I personally am against it, the homosexuals, the abortions. All the stuff, I am against. Dickerson then asked her a follow-up question for clarification. When Donald Trump says  Make American Great Again,  is that what you hear? That it s going to go back to before the time that you re now describing? That s part of it,  Barbara answered.Oh, and Barbara is, of course, a religious nut.  She needs prayer,  Barbara said about Hillary Clinton.  The country always needs prayer.

 Eric Trump Just Got PUNKED By Latina Sisters Wearing ‘Trump’ Shirts Written In Spanish (IMAGES),"When it comes to the Trump family, one thing is for certain, they love photo opportunities, especially with those who they think may boost the image of the campaign.The Trump campaign knows they re losing, by a lot, with minorities, so any chance they can get to make it look like they re not, they seem to hop on board.Seemingly knowing this, a pair of Latina sisters, Annie and Ceci Cardelle from Salisbury, North Carolina, went to go see Eric Trump as he was out campaigning for his dad in their state.The sisters, ages 23 and 17, are Hillary Clinton supporters, and Annie wore a shirt that read  Latina Contra Trump,  which of course means Latina Against Trump. However, knowing neither Trump nor his supporters would likely notice this, and maybe thought it read  Latina Con Trump  which means  with  the sisters took a chance to take advantage of the moment.Ceci tweeted out: When you protest a Trump rally but no one realizes your shirt says  Latinas AGAINST trump  so they take pics w/ you like you re supporters.

 Jan Brewer Insults EVERY American POW While Defending Draft Dodging Trump,"Prisoners of war are routinely subjected to torture. One form of torture that is regularly used is waterboarding, which is a horrific simulation of drowning. To survive that sort of thing on behalf of one s country is heroic   but not according to Donald Trump, who said that Senator John McCain is not a war hero, since he was caught and tortured. These facts make what Trump surrogate Jan Brewer (R-AZ) said regarding how her candidate is being treated in the media with regards to sexual assault accusations that have been leveled at him since the discovery of the Access Hollywood tape all the more offensive.Brewer appeared on CNN s State of the Union Sunday morning, and said: He s been waterboarded by these issues. It seems like it s really been kind of somewhat of a put up oppression of Donald Trump from all of these people lining up. It s just unbelievable. These accusations are a result of Trump flat-out denying that he had ever touched a woman inappropriately during the second debate, which came just two days after he bragged on tape about doing just that. Several of the women said that his denial of what he had done to them was too much, and brought them forward.The thing is, the best witness for these women is Donald Trump himself. It s not  waterboarding,  Gov. Brewer, for people to try to tell the public what they believe to be the truth about a major party presidential candidate.Watch Brewer s offensive remarks below:Former Gov. and Trump supporter Jan Brewer on accusers: Trump has been  waterboarded by the issues  https://t.co/U922Sh1J7G  State of the Union (@CNNSotu) October 23, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 OOPS – Trump’s Campaign Manager CAUGHT Calling Trump A Whiner (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a lot of things, but presidential is not one of them. Kellyanne Conway is Trump s campaign manager, so it s her job to  polish the turd  that the Republican party nominated and make him something palatable to the majority of American voters. Unfortunately for both Trump and Conway, even she doesn t believe that Trump is presidential, at least that s what a video dug up by CNN s Jake Tapper says.The subject was Trump s latest obsession, which is that the election is somehow rigged against him. Tapper noted, on Sunday s State of the Union, that there s no evidence whatsoever of election rigging. As proof, he pulled out a not-so-old video of Conway basically saying the same thing. Back in April when you were working against Donald Trump, when you were working for Ted Cruz and advising his super PAC, you had some tough words for Mr. Trump when he was lashing out at the time against the system being rigged,  Tapper told Conway before refreshing her memory with a video clip. We hear from the Trump campaign, the rules change, it s not fair,  Conway had said in April.  He can whine and complain all he wants that he didn t know the rules. Conway, to her credit, didn t skip a beat and said,  we love watching that clip together. That was about what was happening on the weekends. When Donald Trump would win the vote, he would basically win all the electoral votes in a state, and on the weekends, the Cruz campaign would go back and follow the rules and get back some of those delegates. So no, it s not a pattern for him. Source: Raw StoryThen, she once again tried deflecting from Trump s accusations that the election is rigged against him personally and said that the election is about the system being  rigged  against the  little guy. Here s the video:Of course, Trump s rigged election claims have never been about the  little guy,  unless Trump is trying to claim that as an alleged billionaire, born on 3rd base, he s a  little guy.

 WATCH: Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him By Alec Baldwin And Tom Hanks On SNL,"The presidential debates have been comedy gold for Saturday Night Live and a disaster for Donald Trump and that didn t change last night.Like the first two debates, SNL s cold open featured the third and final debate between Donald Trump as played by Alec Baldwin and Hillary Clinton as played by Kate McKinnon. Only this time, the show featured Tom Hanks as Fox News host and debate moderator Chris Wallace.Hanks  Wallace kicks things off by comparing the debate to the the third Lord of the Rings film,  you don t really want to watch, but hey, you ve come this far. McKinnon s Hillary was eager to feast on Trump, remarking that she  set the table  during the first debate,  fired up the grill  during the second,  and declared that she ll be carving him up and serving up the feast this time around.Baldwin s Trump announced that he would be speaking very quietly like a  baby Trump  this time around, but quickly blew that idea to smithereens when asked about reproductive rights.  They re RIPPING BABIES OUT OF VAGINAS!  he yelled.Hillary responded by sarcastically claiming that the two people most qualified to talk about women s issues are on the stage because she s had a child and used birth control while Trump is a child and his face is birth control.The next question involved immigration and upon Trump saying  bad hombres,  Hillary interrupted to inform Wallace that she filled out her bingo card.Trump then bragged about his relationship with Mexican President Mr. Guacamole and his wife Tacito as Hillary banged her head against the microphone.While trying to explain his plan for ISIS, Trump sniffled his way through a confusing statement which Wallace thankfully interrupted much to Trump s relief.The sexual assault allegation against Trump were also addressed, but when Trump claimed that  no one has more respect for women than I do,  the entire planet erupted in laughter.Trump then complained that the election is being  rigged  by the media because they  take everything I say and everything I do and put it on TV. Wallace then tries to get Trump to repeat after him the he will accept the results of the election if he loses but Trump tweaked it by saying he ll only accept the results  if I win. Here s the full video via YouTube:It s too bad there isn t a fourth debate, because while America probably doesn t want to see the two candidates again, they ll definitely miss Baldwin and McKinnon adding laughter to this madness.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Log Cabin Republicans Finally Grow A Pair When It Comes To Trump,"The idea of there being a group of people who are gay and actively support the GOP is pretty ludicrous, considering the Republican Party is bigoted against LGBTQ people as a matter of practice and policy. After all, their official 2016 party platform is easily the most anti-LGBTQ in history. Nevertheless, the Log Cabin Republicans keep trucking on, trying to make people who will always hate them allow them into their club.Well, it seems even these morons have a line, as they ve decided that there will be no endorsement for GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump from them. This is most curious, considering that the group has said that Trump is the most pro-LGBTQ presidential nominee in the history of the party. This is in no way true of course; after all, Trump picked Mike Pence as his running mate, and he is the man who rose to national prominence by signing a horribly bigoted law that effectively legalized discrimination against LGBTQ people in Indiana, the state he currently governs. Here is what the Log Cabin folks had to say about Trump, and their decision not to endorse, even though he pandered to LGBTQ people, which they say is  unprecedented  for their party: But Log Cabin Republicans have long emphasized that we are not a single-issue organization, nor are our members single-issue voters. Even if we were, rhetoric alone regarding LGBT issues does not equate to doctrine.As Mr. Trump spoke positively about the LGBT community in the United States, he concurrently surrounded himself with senior advisors with a record of opposing LGBT equality, and committed himself to supporting legislation such as the so-called  First Amendment Defense Act  that Log Cabin Republicans opposes. Well, at least they showed a bit of backbone here, but it still boggles the mind that these idiots think that they re a part of the right political party. Oh well, this is more than most people who look at the Log Cabin Republicans and shake their heads could ask for.Featured image via Brian Blanco/Getty Images",News,"October 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ivanka’s Clothing Line Could Be In A LOT Of Trouble Because Her Father Is A Sick Sexual Predator,"During all the fallout from the  Access Hollywood  tape that first revealed Donald Trump to be a sexual predator, and now, with all the women coming forward to accuse him of sexual assault, Ivanka has stood staunchly by her father. It seems, though, that such support is hurting her own business. Ivanka has a clothing line, which is sold in stores like TJ Maxx, but women who ve been forced to relive their own pain from sexual assault because of Trump are boycotting Ivanka s brand.Cosmopolitan spoke to Lindsey Ledford, a sexual assault survivor, about what seeing the Trump name on a blouse did to her: My first thought was,  Grab them by the pussy. We can do anything we want. Don t even ask,  Ledford told Cosmopolitan.com. The blouse was triggering traumatic flashbacks to physical abuse she d suffered in the past, and to times she d been grabbed or groped by men without her consent.  None of them ever asked how I felt, what I was thinking, or what I wanted. They didn t wait,  she wrote in a flurry of tweets at T.J. Maxx after fleeing the store.  That is what  Trump  means to me,  she told me: complete disregard for women and their bodies.  It doesn t matter if Ivanka s name is in front of it, or Donald s.' There s a growing coalition of women who are working to boycott both Ivanka s brand and the stores that carry it because it s too closely linked to Donald Trump. This plan came about because of Shannon Coulter, the CEO of a boutique marketing agency, just after the  Access Hollywood  tape came out. She tweeted:Not enough to not buy Ivanka s collection. She campaigns for him. We should avoid stores that carry it. #fashionnotfascism #ivankant  Shannon Coulter ? (@shannoncoulter) October 12, 2016Ivanka herself has said that she s a daughter, not a surrogate, and it s been hard for women to condemn her for supporting her father because it s hard to be objective about family members. However, increasing numbers of women see Ivanka as representative of a culture that demeans women to the point where it s okay to harass and assault them.Cosmopolitan also spoke to several other women. One said her revulsion at seeing Ivanka s name inside a shoe was a  visceral response,  because her attacker used almost the exact methods Trump spoke of in his tape.Another woman threw out some pumps from Ivanka s line, and refused to shop at stores that carried the brand, when it came to her wedding.  My wedding is a day of love. I m not going to wear clothes that represent hate,  she said.Those who are busy defending Trump don t really seem to know or care what this revelation has done to women all over the country. Perhaps worse, especially for women, is that Ivanka has actually defended her father s vile treatment of women: He recognizes it was crude language. He was embarrassed that he said those things, and he apologized. That s not language consistent with any conversation I ve ever had with him, or any conversation I ve ever overheard, so it was a bit jarring to hear. I think he was sincere in his apology. It s hard for women who have been harassed and assaulted to listen to a fellow woman defend the very type of predator that hurt them. Although Ivanka s brand hasn t yet lost a ton of business, this boycott movement will likely grow as her father makes increasingly disgusting remarks about how he s going to get his revenge on the women accusing him of assault. That will be particularly true if she continues to openly defend him.Featured image by Joe Scarnici via Getty Images",News,"October 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Supporter Aims Gun At Hillary, Asks Donald To Give The Order To Assassinate","Seriously, Trump supporters are scarily messed up people.The Secret Service needs to be on high alert through Election Day, because Trump supporters are just waiting for Donald Trump to give the word so they can launch an assassination attempt against the Democratic nominee.As the third presidential debate got underway on Wednesday, a Trump supporter watching it on television decided to aim his gun at Hillary Clinton and take a picture of it for Twitter. He a message to Donald Trump telling him he is ready to pull the trigger whenever he commands him to do so.Winning Democrats reports that  Faggotini Alfredo  (or @yunghomo), which is clearly a fake name, posted the image and tagged Trump with the caption,  Give me the go-ahead my guy. Here s the image via Winning Democrats.This isn t the first time a Trump supporter has threatened to assassinate Hillary.Trump himself called for  Second Amendment people  to do something to stop Hillary during a rally in August.Ever since then, the calls for bloody rebellion and assassination have only grown and gotten more frightening.One Trump supporter told the Boston Globe last week, If she s in office, I hope we can start a coup. She should be in prison or shot. That s how I feel about it. We re going to have a revolution and take them out of office if that s what it takes. There s going to be a lot of bloodshed. But that s what it s going to take I would do whatever I can for my country. Another Trump supporter in Georgia said he s ready for civil war if Hillary becomes president. The war that s going to break out if Hillary Clinton s elected, if that happens,  he said.  Your patriots are going to overthrow the government.' Trump s supporters are only getting more eager to commit acts of violence as Election Day approaches. These people are scary, and clearly they are just itching to start firing bullets if Trump gives the word. And if he does, he should be immediately arrested for treason.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images, tweet via Winning Democrats",News,"October 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" BUSTED: Trump Running Mate Mike Pence Caught Suppressing Up To 10,000 Black Votes","The math for the election is very simple: The more black voters, the worse the results will be for the Republican Party and the party s presidential nominee, Donald Trump. As a result, the Republicans have a perverse incentive to keep black voter numbers as low as possible.And now it appears that Trump s running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, may be doing his part to emulate the Jim Crow south and bar black voters from being registered.Connie Lawson, the Secretary of State for Indiana, sent a letter to state election officials telling them that Patriot Majority USA, a group trying to register black voters were  nefarious actors  operating in the state. Lawson told officials to snitch to authorities if they received voter registration forms from the group. Combined with state police executing a search warrant against the group, it gave the appearance of vote suppression, according to Craig Varoga, the group s president.The publicity surrounding the actions taken by Lawson and Indiana s state police have cast a shadow over the nonprofits, with many stories accusing them of voter fraud.Varoga said the Oct. 4 police action prevented the group from registering 5,000 to 10,000 additional voters ahead of Indiana s Oct. 11 voter registration deadline. He s worried that clerks won t count some of the 45,000 applications the group had already collected.Republicans, as they often do in election years, have mounted an assault on voter registration drives and mobilization efforts. They have particularly targeted these efforts to minority communities. North Carolina Republicans were recently rebuked by the federal courts when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals declared most of a 2013 law invalid, since documents revealed that it was designed specifically to target minority voters with a voter ID law, and by banning same-day registration, early voting, and out-of-precinct voting.The judge in that case, Diana Gribbon Motz, wrote, The State s very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race specifically its concern that African Americans, who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats, had too much access to the franchise. In Indiana, the Pence regime seems to be working to do the same deed.Featured image by Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 2.0 via Flickr",News,"October 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GOP Calls In Thugs To Stop Clinton From Winning Key Swing State,"Pennsylvania is always one of the most sought-after states in presidential elections, and even though it has been reliably Democratic, Republicans often believe that its 20 electoral votes are within reach. With that in mind, there s almost nothing the GOP won t do to get those votes, including busing in people from out of state in order to intimidate voters   especially minority voters.And now Pennsylvania Republicans are going to court to do just that.The Pennsylvania Republican Party filed a complaint late Friday night asking a federal court to allow out-of-county poll watchers to monitor voting stations on Election Day.Filed on behalf of eight Keystone State voters, the suit alleges that state law restricting poll watchers to the county in which they re registered violates the First Amendment and denies them their right to equal protection under the law.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been muttering for weeks that the election has been  rigged    a conspiracy theory that has coincided with him dropping in almost every national poll, from anywhere from 5 to 11 percent.As a result, many Republican voters have now convinced themselves that there is a massive national operation underway to  steal  the election from Trump. And Trump has told his backers that this effort is coming from cities in swing states, and those cities are largely the main source of votes from black and Latino voters, both of whom are overwhelmingly Democratic.Those voters are more motivated than usual to vote against Trump, because he launched his campaign by describing Mexicans as  criminals  and  rapists  and repeatedly making it seem as if black people only live in urban blight, forever under fire by drug gangs and enduring lives of complete desperation. Success and middle class livelihoods for ethnic minorities simply don t exist in Trump s view of the world.And his party doesn t want them voting.Featured image by Michael Candelori, CC BY 2.0 via Flickr",News,"October 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 FAIL! The Trump Organization’s Credit Score Will Make You Laugh,"While the controversy over Trump s personal tax returns continues, business credit rating company Nav decided to take a look at his business  credit, and published the results on their website. Nav, which actually does have an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau (as opposed to Trump U. s final rating), pulled together the factors affecting business credit scores and discovered something truly laughable.The highest possible business score is 100. The Trump Organization s score is 19. Nineteen. As in more than 15 but less than 20, and it s actually dropped 18 points. This puts the company in the medium to high-risk category:The organization is considered highly likely to default on its debts, and it averages sending payments 17 days late. They also have six derogatories, which can be delinquent loans that have been turned over to collections, as well as tax liens and judgments against the organization. According to Nav, that last one usually means the business was the defendant in a lawsuit and is now required to pay damages to the plaintiff.Compare that to the Clinton Foundation, which has a score of 42. 42 isn t great, but it s a hell of a lot better than the Trump Organization s.*Note: The Clinton Foundation has been around since 1997, but has only been known in its current form for the last three years.Despite not having stellar credit either, the Clinton Foundation also has no derogatories and makes its payments on time.This whole thing is laughable considering the wonderful businessman Trump seems to think he is. It s even more laughable considering that Trump says nobody knows debt better than he does. In August, he boasted that he has  very little debt  relative to his assets.Regardless of whether that s true, the fact that the Trump Organization s credit score is so low suggests that Trump is either not nearly as good at managing what debt he does have as well as he claims, or he s not nearly as good at managing his businesses as well as he claims.This credit score is hilarious.Featured image by Scott Olson via Getty Images",News,"October 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 WATCH: Trump Admits America Will Pay For His Dumb $25 Billion Wall,"Donald Trump just broke his biggest promise to his supporters in a BIGLY way.During his speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on Saturday, the Republican nominee listed some of the things he plans to do in his first 100 days in office if he is elected to the presidency on November 8th.One of those things is a draconian anti-immigration policy that includes deporting millions of immigrants, whom Trump called criminals and killers, back to Mexico. He also said he would cut off funding to cities that give immigrants sanctuary.But his main point, as usual, was all about his damn wall along the Mexican border.Trump has repeatedly declared that Mexico will pay for this massive structure, which experts estimate will cost up to $25 billion.But during his speech, Trump changed his tune in a way that suggests America will actually be picking up the tab and merely hoping that Mexico will reimburse us for the cost. The End Illegal Immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border,  Trump said.  Don t worry about it. Remember I said that Mexico is paying for the wall. However, he then added this remark. With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall, okay? Here s the video via YouTube. Trump s remarks on the wall are at the 32:46 mark.In other words, America will be paying for Trump s wall if he becomes president, NOT Mexico.Because in order for there to even be a need for Mexico to reimburse us, it means America would have to pay for the wall first. And that means American taxpayers would be on the hook.But just like his insistence that Mexico will pay for the wall outright, Trump has no way of forcing Mexico to reimburse us either. So Trump just promised to INCREASE the national debt by billions of dollars within his first 100 days.In short, the central promise Trump made to his supporters has just gone up entirely in smoke.The question is are Trump s supporters too dumb to notice that their hero just admitted that he has been lying to them this whole time? Probably not.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Supporters Declare WAR On Paul Ryan, And Republicans Only Have Themselves To Blame","If Donald Trump goes down, so does House Speaker Paul Ryan.At least that s what Trump supporters are suggesting in an attack on Ryan on Breitbart.com, whose CEO Steve Bannon works on the Trump campaign.An article posted on Breitbart accuses Ryan being a Hillary Clinton supporter who has a pro-Islamic agenda simply because he has been critical of Trump and some of the things he has said and done throughout the campaign.Ryan and Clinton share a progressive, globalist worldview, which is at odds with Trump s  America first  approach. Indeed, both Clinton and Ryan have said that they see themselves as representatives not only for American citizens, but also for foreign nationals and foreign interests. This view that the needs of foreign citizens are equal to the needs of American citizens reflects the belief that Americans are only part of many interest groups that a lawmaker ought to consider when crafting legislation even as he or she negotiates with other countries, which always put their citizens first. The divide between progressive globalism and nation-state conservatism perhaps helps to illuminate why Ryan has spent months both quietly and loudly undermining his own party s nominee for president,  the article continues.Of course, saying that Paul Ryan is in league with Hillary Clinton is absurd. After all, Ryan may be one of the less openly insane Republicans but he s definitely NOT a progressive.But conservatives are so enraged at Ryan for not blindly pledging allegiance to Trump that they are now calling for his head, which means Paul Ryan is in serious jeopardy of losing the tight House race he is embroiled in. And even if he wins on November 8th, Ryan faces a revolt from conservatives against him continuing to be Speaker, that is if Republicans keep control of the House.Either way, Paul Ryan is being undermined by Trump and his minions, so it continues to be a mystery why Ryan still hasn t unendorsed him.Conservatives are even questioning Ryan s loyalty to America and to the party.The push to remove Ryan as Speaker is  picking up some steam,  said Congressman Mark Meadows who also voted for Ryan last year after leading the charge to remove Ryan s predecessor, John Boehner, as Speaker. Meadows explained that a lot of conservatives now  question the loyalty of the Speaker  in light of Ryan s treatment of Trump.Frankly, Republicans only have themselves to blame for this. They gave their far right conservative base a place at the table and now these extremists have taken over the party. For years, Republicans used fear and hate to gin up their base against Democrats. Now that anger is being turned against any Republican who refuses to bow down and kiss Trump s ass.Trump has used the Republican playbook against them. And the result is a once proud party descending into chaos and tearing itself apart from within.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"October 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Jr. Says Bragging About Sexual Assault Is Just ‘A Fact Of Life’,"Donald Trump Jr. tried in vain to brush off his dad s boasts of being able to sexually assault women, arguing that when men talk, these kinds of remarks are just  a fact of life. During an interview with KIRO radio 97.3 on Friday, Junior said that men always say such lewd things about women as  grab  em by the pussy  and it is just an inevitability of life. Obviously he s not happy about that, but I think we probably all know guys who have had conversations with other guys that go a little bit in that direction, that s a fact of life, Trump Jr. said. I think he s able to relate to ordinary Americans because in many cases he is still very much like that. He does do that. He hasn t spent his whole life sitting there polishing every statement he s ever made, every conversation he s ever had,  he added.Trump Jr. started to say that his father  speaks from the heart  and then cut himself off, apparently realizing that this argument wasn t exactly helping the situation. He finally admitted that yes, his father s comments were a  mistake,  but explained that all men who aren t politicians talk like this because the only reason you don t brag about sexual assault is to con people into voting for you. He speaks from the heart, that one is obviously one that we don t want to   that was a mistake, he recognizes that, he realizes it   but he s able to make a mistake because he hasn t spent his whole life just trying to be a politician. Trump s campaign has been in a tailspin following the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood tape that featured Donald bragging about being able to sexually assault any woman he pleases thanks to his celebrity status. During the second presidential debate, he claimed that he had never actually done these kinds of things to a woman. But in the days that followed, at least ten women have stepped forward to accuse Trump of doing to them exactly what he described on the bombshell tape.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Don Lemon And CNN Panel Laugh At Trump Supporter For Denying Everything He Has Done,"One of Trump s minions just embarrassed herself on CNN and everyone laughed at her.During a discussion on Friday night, Trump supporter Gina Loudon had the gall to repeatedly claim that the Republican nominee is not a sexist or a racist and even denied much of the factual evidence presented by the other panelists as proof that she is wrong. Words matter,  Symone Sanders told Loudon.  Donald Trump is running for president of the United States, okay? So, his words are extremely important because as president, your words   I mean we can talk about the fact he s discriminated against African-Americans, Latinos in this country, Muslims  Loudon cut her off by demanding to know when Donald Trump ever discriminated against these groups of people even though there is video tape of Trump calling Mexicans  rapists  and calling for banning Muslims from entering the country just because of their religion.Bakari Sellers chimed in by citing Trump s discrimination against black people on housing applications. Trump even had to settle the lawsuit because he knew he would lose. Trump also called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five even though they were later found innocent. Gina was asking one simple questions about actions,  Sellers began.  And Donald Trump s actions, and when has he discriminated so I decided we can recite a few of his actions. We can go to his housing discrimination lawsuits, in which he had to settle not one, but two, because he literally marked  C  on applications for  colored.  We can go to the Central Park Five in which he took ads out for these five people  But once again, Loudon denied that Trump ever did these things.LOUDON:  Donald Trump had nothing do with that! LEMON:  Wait, wait wait. You said Donald Trump had nothing to do with taking out ads on the Central Park Five? LOUDON:  Donald Trump himself. It was not Donald Trump himself. Loudon also denied that Trump mocked a disabled New York Times reporter despite the fact that there is video of him doing it, which drew laughter from the panelists, Don Lemon, and even from people in the studio off camera. Stop. Stop it y alls,  Lemon said in an effort to settle everyone down.  People in the studio are even laughing. But Lemon had a hard time doing so because Loudon just droned on about how Donald Trump is a saint and how Hillary Clinton is guilty of everything. Lemon just smiled and rested his head on his hand.Here s the video via VidMe.Trump s supporters are so desperate that they are denying facts and evidence at every turn. They are trying to fool America into thinking that Trump has a clean slate. This is what we can expect from now until the election on November 8th.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Longtime Trump Friend Russell Simmons Drops Bombshell On Trump’s DISGUSTING Racism Toward Him (VIDEO),"Music mogul Russell Simmons has been friends with Republican nominee Donald Trump for the past 30 years, and has finally come forward to express his opinion on Trump s run for the presidency.In a recent interview with Fortune, Simmons revealed that although Trump had many political and personal beliefs that he didn t agree with, he still found Trump to be a likable person. However, Simmons made it perfectly clear that he didn t think Trump was a  suitable person for the presidency.  In expressing how unqualified Trump was to run the country, Simmons was candid about the racist and anti-semitic comments he heard and witnessed Trump make over the last three decades. Simmons said: People carry beliefs that are hurtful, none of us are enlightened   I would laugh off things he said that were off-color, that kind of didn t represent my viewpoints. Certainly, I heard things that seemed a little racist. Simmons observed that Trump s remarks, which were often times Islamophobic and anti-black, could have devastating consequences on the country. He said: The fear is that his statements would take people who would never even admit to having those seeds of hate in them, and water those seeds, and then those people would say things they wouldn t even imagine saying, and then it became the norm. You can watch Simmons  interview below:[ad3media campaign= 1215 ]Simmons has spoken out about Trump s racism before. Although he may have been trying to be kind to Trump during the Fortune interview, he was much more blunt in a September interview with CNN Money. Simmons told CNN: [Donald] has said racist things for 30 years. White supremacy, he s the epitome of it. He represents the image of white supremacy more than any candidate I ve seen. Having been Trump s friend for several decades, there s no one better to expose who Trump really is. Hopefully, America is listening. Trump s offensive campaign behavior isn t an act for entertainment or shock value   it s who he really is, and it s the kind of President he would be.Featured image via Win McNamee and Frazer Harrison / Getty Images",News,"October 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Has Ruined His Own Name So Badly His Hotels Resort To DRASTIC Steps To Bring In Business,"Donald Trump probably thought that running for president would be a huge boon for all his businesses. However, it s starting to look as though that may not be anything like true. Trump Hotels just announced that they re dropping Trump s name from all their new hotels. His name will stay on existing hotels, but new ones will carry the name  Scion. According to Travel and Leisure, the company insists that this move is an attempt to reach Millennials, and has nothing to do with how Trump may have damaged his own brand. They re ignoring the fact that Trump s newest hotel, built inside the historic Post Office building in D.C., actually had to reduce prices to fill rooms during the peak season.But worse than that   they had to drop prices below $500 per night to try and get people in for the International Monetary Fund conference two weeks ago.Every other luxury hotel in that same area sold out weeks ahead of time for that conference, while Trump International struggled to attract guests. As New York Magazine put it: For a five-star hotel in downtown Washington to have vacancies during major IMF meetings is a little like having empty rooms when the Super Bowl is in town.  The reason why there were vacancies is the political atmosphere. People don t want to go there for fear that they would be asked,  Why are you staying here?  says Ada Pena, a travel agent with ABA Travel in Washington, D.C. In addition to that, reservations throughout the company have plunged by well over 50 percent, too, showing that Trump s absurd campaign is destroying his name. A destroyed name means a destroyed brand   he s not nearly the wonderful, amazing, brilliant person and businessman he believes himself to be.It s so bad that, on Oct. 7, Mark Cuban tweeted that Bernard Madoff had a better brand than Trump. For those that don t know, Madoff was behind one of the biggest Ponzi schemes this country ever saw, and is now behind bars. That s how toxic Cuban believes Trump has become to his own businesses.Every single @realDonaldTrump hotel and golf course is toast. Done. Over. Bernie Madoff now has a better brand.  Mark Cuban (@mcuban) October 8, 2016Trump s bragging about being able to sexually assault women definitely doesn t help. Yet, Trump Hotels refuses to acknowledge that their namesake is a source of their problems. They re as delusional as Trump himself over what s happening.Businessman brilliant enough to get the U.S. back on track? Ha! We think not.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images",News,"October 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Curt Schilling Wants Elizabeth Warren’s Seat But Dammit He Just Can’t Figure Out These Jews (VIDEO),"Curt Schilling, who is challenging Elizabeth Warren for her senate seat, took part in an interview on CNN this Friday. And well, let s just say that it didn t go very well for him.Schilling finds himself completely baffled by Jews and just can t figure out why they vote for Democrats. So he decided to ask Jake Tapper because he s a Jewish guy. In hindsight, he will hopefully realize what an ass he made out of himself in the process. I would like to ask you something as a person who is practicing the Jewish faith and has since you were young,  Schilling began. I don t understand  and this is, maybe this is the amateur, non-politician in me  I don t understand how people of Jewish faith can back the Democratic Party, which over the last 50 years has been so clearly anti-Israel, so clearly anti-Jewish Israel,  Schilling charged. I don t know what else would need to be done, said or happen for people to understand that they don t  the Democratic Party is alive for Israel only because we have agreements in place to make them have to be. Tapper, obviously trying to hold it together after such an appalling remark, responded, Well, I don t speak for Jews   and I don t support the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. I would imagine   just to try to answer your question   that one of the reasons many Jews are Democrats has more to do with Democrat support for social welfare programs and that sort of thing than it does for Israel,  said Tapper. And I know that a lot of Jews that are very strong supporters of Israel do support the Republican Party,  he continued,  but   again, I don t speak for Jews. Well, if there was any doubt that Warren would be able to beat Schilling in the upcoming election, there shouldn t be anymore. He just shot himself and his campaign in the foot.Watch Schilling try to figure out the Jews, here:Curt Schilling: You re Jewish. Why are Jews Democrats? Dems hate Israel.

" Trump Tries To Throw Michelle Obama Under The Bus, Falls Flat On His Face Instead (VIDEO)","You would think that after President Barack Obama specifically warned Republican nominee Donald Trump not to attack his wife, Trump wouldn t want to test those waters. Then again, when has Trump ever listened to the advice of anyone other than himself?On Friday during a rally in North Carolina, Trump tried to slam First Lady Michelle Obama by taking a line out of a 2007 campaign speech to smear Michelle, President Barack Obama and his opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump tried to throw each of his biggest threats under the bus when he said:We have a bunch of babies running our country, a bunch of losers. They are babies. We have a president, all he wants to do is campaign. His wife, all she wants to do is campaign.I see how much his wife likes Hillary, but wasn t she the one that started the statement:  If you can t take care of your home, you can t take care of the White House or the country? Trump was quoting a line from Michelle s 2007 speech when she was campaigning for her husband   but he took it completely out of context. Michelle had been talking about how she managed politics, two careers and raising two children. This balancing act between family and work responsibilities is something that many Americans could relate to, which was why she said it. Her words were:One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can t run your own house, you certainly can t run the White House. Can t do it. So, so we ve adjusted our schedules to make sure that our girls are first, so while he s traveling around, I do day trips. They just know that I was at home to tuck them in at night, and it keeps them grounded, and, and children, the children in our country have to know that they come first. And our girls do, and that s why we re doing this. We re in this race for not just our children, but all of our children. It was a beautiful speech, and it is simply disgusting that Trump would use it in such a negative context. However, it s a sure sign that the business mogul is still bitter about the speech Michelle gave on Thursday, where Michelle accurately stated that Trump could not relate to the average American s struggles. She said:Perhaps living life high up in a tower in a world of exclusive clubs, measuring success by wins and losses, the number of zeros in your bank account. Perhaps you just develop a different set of values. Maybe with so little exposure to people who are different than you, it becomes easy to take advantage of those who are down on their luck. To him, most of America is  them. So basically, the only way Trump can attack Michelle is by making things up and twisting her words   but he only makes himself look stupid in the end.

 Salma Hayek Turned Donald Trump Down For A Date And His Revenge Was Classic Trump,"Donald Trump loves beautiful women. We know that because he s told us that, repeatedly. In fact, he once called hot women his  alcoholism,  especially if they are 17 or 18. Salma Hayek is undeniably beautiful. It s no wonder Trump tried to ask her out. It s also no wonder that she said  no.  What Trump did after that, though was pure Donald Trump.When I met that man, I had a boyfriend, and he tried to become his friend to get my home telephone number,  she said, describing meeting Trump early in her career before she was well-known.  He got my number and he would call me to invite me out. When I told him I wouldn t go out with him even if I didn t have a boyfriend, [which he took as disrespectful], he called   well, he wouldn t say he called, but someone told the National Enquirer,  Hayek continued, adding that she never went out with him. Someone told the National Enquirer   I m not going to say who, because you know that whatever he wants to come out comes out in the National Enquirer. It said that he wouldn t go out with me because I was too short,  she said. Later, he called and left me a message.  Can you believe this? Who would say this? I don t want people to think this about you,  she said.  He thought that I would try to go out with him so people wouldn t think that s why he wouldn t go out with me. Like most things that come out of Trump s mouth, his denial didn t ring true, especially after it was revealed that he paid $120,000 from Trump Foundation money for a prize that included dinner with Hayek.Hayek has never particularly been a fan of Trump. In August, she compared him to a first grader.[ad3media campaign= 1214 ]She is a strong supporter, though, of Hillary Clinton. Just days ago, she made a Spanish language video in support of the Secretary of State.I guess we ll have to wait and see what Trump has to say about Hayek in his next 3:00 Twitter rant.Featured image of Selma Hayek via Mike Coppola/Getty Images | Featured image of Donald Trump via Gerardo Mora/Getty Images.",News,"October 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The Daily Caller Edits Woman’s Tragic Pregnancy Story In The SICKEST, Most TWISTED Way Imaginable","The Daily Caller is disgusting. Any media outlet that isn t disgusting wouldn t have been so cold, callous and cruel to a woman who publicly shared her difficult and tragic story of having to terminate her pregnancy after 20 weeks. The New York Times was kind enough to publish Meredith Isaakson s story in an op-ed, but what reporter Rachel Stoltzfoos and The Daily Caller did to it is beyond reprehensible.What did they do? In their own words: We Edited A New York Times Op-Ed On Abortion So It Reads Correctly. Edited so it reads correctly,  does not describe the evil they just published. Isaakson found out her son wasn t likely to survive until birth, let alone after birth, because of a fatal defect in the development of his heart   half of it was missing. It was an abnormality that wasn t detectable until about 20 weeks gestation, even though his heart had stopped developing correctly at five weeks. She then says: In the days that followed, after the poking and prodding, after the meetings with pediatric cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons and geneticists, my husband and I decided to terminate our pregnancy. I was 22 weeks pregnant when they wheeled me into the operating room, two weeks shy of viability in the state of California. Here s how The Daily Caller edited that paragraph: In the days that followed, after the poking and prodding, after the meetings with pediatric cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons and geneticists, my husband and I decided to terminate our pregnancy [direct an abortionist to rip him limb from limb out of my womb in order to end his life]. I was 22 weeks pregnant when they wheeled me into the operating room, two weeks shy of viability in the state of California [the point when the state of California determined he is a human with the right to live].  [emphasis in original]How does anybody do this to a woman who wanted her baby, but learned that his chances for survival were extremely slim, and was left with a choice no parent should ever have to face? How vile can you be? How black is the heart of someone who can so completely disregard what Isaakson was going through this way?But it gets worse. Isaakson goes on to say: For us, the decision was about compassion for our unborn baby, who would face overwhelming and horribly painful obstacles. Compassion for our 2-year-old son, who would contend with hours upon hours in a hospital, missing out on invaluable time spent with his parents, and the death of a very real sibling. It was about compassion for our marriage. Perhaps most important, it was about our belief that parenthood sometimes means we sacrifice our own dreams so our children don t have to suffer. Here s how The Daily Caller tore her to shreds for that paragraph: For us, the decision was about compassion for our unborn baby, who would face overwhelming and horribly painful obstacles [if we failed to suction him out of my womb with complete disregard for the pain he may already be capable of feeling]. Compassion for our 2-year-old son, who would contend with hours upon hours in a hospital, missing out on invaluable time spent with his parents, and the death of a very real sibling [killing of his brother commissioned by his mom and dad]. It [Killing our son] was about compassion for our marriage. Perhaps most important, it [killing our son] was about our belief that parenthood sometimes means we sacrifice our own dreams [kill our baby boy] so our [other] children don t have to suffer.  [emphasis in original]The entire thing just gets worse, and worse. The Daily Caller has proven themselves to be pro-birth, but not pro-life, and shown that they don t give a flying rat s ass about the pain the original news caused Isaakson and her family, to say nothing of the pain of this decision.If this is how the pro-birth crowd sees this, then they re bereft of compassion, and they re bereft of love and they are bereft of empathy. Their hearts are the darkest of abysses. Sure, they say they re speaking for those who can t speak for themselves, but they do so at the horrific expense of those making the decision. There is no regard for Isaakson, and what she went through, in this perversion of her op-ed.This is probably the coldest, most heartless, most sickening thing a media outlet can do to someone. We sincerely hope that Rachel Stoltzfoos and everyone who was involved in publishing this never face such a terrible, gut-wrenching decision themselves, because nobody should ever have to go through this. Period. She and The Daily Caller owe Isaakson and every other woman who s had to make this awful decision a heartfelt apology, though, at the bare minimum.To read Isaakson s story, click here. To read The Daily Caller s so-called  edit,  click here, but be careful.

 Hillary’s Response To Trump Tweeting He Won The Debate Is Pure Comedy Genius (TWEET),"It s not an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump has Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He has pretty much every characteristic to classify him as such:Sorry, not  pretty much every characteristic    absolutely every characteristic.So, when Trump tweeted out that he won the last presidential debate, one where Hillary Clinton clearly wiped the floor with his haystack of hair, this only confirmed his delusional thinking.Trump tweeted out: The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON!

 KKK Poster Boy David Duke Qualifies For Louisiana Senate Debate Being Held At Black University,"Former KKK grand wizard David Duke has officially qualified to participate in the Louisiana state senate debate after pulling in a whopping five percent of the vote in a new poll. The debate will be televised and is being held at a historically black university.Duke, who is a well-known white supremacist, announced in July that he was running for a seat on the Louisiana state senate. Not only has he been disavowed by his fellow Republicans, but the Republican National Committee and Louisiana GOP also looked into ways to boot his bigoted butt out of the party altogether.The debate itself is being hosted by Dillard University, a university in New Orleans that is historically black. Regarding this ironic twist of fate, Duke said Dillard is pretty supportive of Black Lives Matter, and I ve been pretty critical of them.  He added that he plans to request extra security at the event. Go figure.The poll that determined Duke had garnered the necessary five percent of the vote was commissioned by Raycom Media, which is the owner of four television stations throughout the state of Louisiana. The poll was conducted by Mason-Dixon between Oct. 17 to Oct. 19 and included 625 registered voters.As for the rest of the candidates in the race and their standings in the poll, Politico reports:  Louisiana hold its all-party primary on Election Day. A candidate can win the seat with a majority of the vote, but the Senate seat looks almost certain to go to a Dec. 10 runoff between the two top vote-getters that day. GOP State Treasurer John Kennedy led the poll with 24 percent of the vote, followed by Democratic Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell with 19 percent and Democratic attorney Caroline Fayard with 12 percent. Republican congressmen Charles Boustany and John Fleming earned 12 and 11 percent of the vote, respectively. When Duke announced his bid for the senate seat late last summer, he said that his decision to run had been inspired by the success of Donald Trump. In the video he released, Duke said was  overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the ideas that I ve championed for years.

 Trump Declares That He Unanimously ‘WON’ The Third Debate And The Internet LAUGHS At Him,"Grab your popcorn and sit down because Trump just posted a tweet that proves how delusional he really is.It s been two days since the third presidential debate, and Donald Trump s campaign continues to roll downhill in flames like a rickety gasoline-soaked wagon on fire.But Donald Trump, in yet another lie to his supporters, actually claimed on Twitter that he won the debate by a  unanimous  decision. The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON!  Trump wrote.  Thank you, these are very exciting times. The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON! Thank you, these are very exciting times.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2016Apparently, Donald Trump is confused about what winning actually looks like.Because not only did most reaction polls indicate that Hillary Clinton won the debate, the scientific polls indicate she won as well.A CBS News poll found that 49 percent of debate watchers surveyed said Clinton won, which is 10 points higher than the 39 percent who say Trump won.Similarly, Clinton was declared the winner 46 percent to 37 percent of those surveyed by an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll.Also, the CNN/ORC poll found that Clinton won the debate as well, with 52 percent saying Hillary won versus only 39 percent who said Trump won.And that s not all. Hillary also beat the hell out of Trump in a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll by 17 points, 43 percent to 26 percent.In other words, Trump LOST the debate on Wednesday night in Las Vegas just as he lost the first two.Twitter users certainly think Trump s declaration of victory is a joke.

 Former RNC Chair Michael Steele Refuses To Vote For Donald Trump,"Donald Trump has dragged the Republican Party so far down the toilet that former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele won t vote for him.During a dinner in San Francisco on Friday, Steele declared that he  will not be voting for Trump  because he has  captured that racist underbelly, that frustration, that angry underbelly of American life and gave voice to that. Indeed, the Republican nominee has aggressively courted the angry white racist vote since the beginning of his campaign, which is why white supremacist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis have flocked to him.In fact, Steele finds Trump s rhetoric do disgusting that he admitted that he  was damn near puking during the debates. But while he won t cast his vote for Trump, Steele says he isn t voting for Hillary Clinton either.Regardless, Steele is now the third former GOP Chair to stand against Trump and that s bad news for the Republican Party and their effort to attract minority voters to the ever-shrinking tent. The longer they cling to their new leader, the more and more Republicans will be pushed away. And whether they vote for Hillary or not, the GOP is going to find it almost impossible to make up the difference with their hardcore voters.While the Republican base is rabid, it just doesn t have the numbers to overcome the loss of more moderate voters who have rejected Trump.And Republican leaders only have themselves to blame. They have been pandering to Trump s supporters for years even though racism, sexism, and ignorance are common traits among them. Rather than moving toward the center, Republicans ended up giving these extremists a seat at the table and have found themselves being pushed out of their own home ever since by fringe conservatives who only want more control. Now the party has been hijacked and Republican leaders are going to have a hell of a time trying to wrest control back from them.That may be possible after a few years, but it s likely that the Republican Party will be in chaos for many years to come, which means you can bet that more Republicans are going to find another party to vote for or they won t vote at all.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"October 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

This time, though, he teamed up with Songify to re-enact the third presidential debate, poking special fun at two of Donald Trump s many terrible moments. It also relives some of Hillary s most searing burns, and is just all-around perfect.The song is titled,  Bad Hombres, Nasty Women,  which are two of the quotes that the junkyard heap known as Donald Trump is most remembered for right now. The video not only features both Hillary and Trump autotuned to fit the music, but also features  Weird Al  himself in the role of the moderator.The first words of the song, in fact, are,  Such a nasty woman,  from Trump, and then Hillary joins in with: He choked. He choked. He goes around with crocodile tears,  to which Trump can only say,  Such a nasty woman. A little bit later on,  Weird Al  asks the candidates a very important question: To stop a Cold War, what should we be doin ? Would you go thumb-wrestle Vladimir Putin? We have so many adversaries overseas. Can we all agree to be frenemies? Finally, no song about the third debate would be complete without making fun of the Donald s ongoing use of the word,  Bigly,  and  Weird Al  works it in like the maestro he is. But, perhaps one of the best parts are the expressions on  Weird Al s  face as Hillary and King Cheeto answer his questions.

 GOP Lawmaker: ‘A Lady Needs To Be Told When She’s Being Nasty’,"A Texas lawmaker just defended Donald Trump s remark toward Hillary Clinton during the third and final presidential debate. Clinton was discussing Social Security and Medicare when Donald interrupted her to say the Democratic presidential nominee is  such a nasty woman.  Apparently Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) agrees with Donald. You know what, she s saying some nasty things,  Babin told Alan Colmes on this show. You think it s appropriate to call her a nasty woman?  Colmes asked. Well, I m a genteel Southerner, Alan,  Babin replied. So that means no?  Colmes asked. The radio host had to repeatedly press Babin to answer the question. You re ducking me, Congressman,  Colmes said when Babit tried to pivot the topic to immigration. No, I think sometimes a lady needs to be told when she s being nasty. Oh, really?  Colmes asked.Babin replied,  I do. My assessment is that Mrs. Clinton has got so much baggage,  Babin continued.  I think she s done some nasty things. Colmes asked Babin about Trump s  rigged  election  rhetoric.  We re going to have to agree to disagree,  Babin said.The Texas lawmaker went on to blame the media for Trump s negative coverage.Colmes asked who he thought would win in November.  Im sure hoping that Mr. Trump wins,  Babin said.Audio courtesy of CNN:Babin initially backed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) but later threw his support behind the GOP presidential nominee.We re glad that Babin brought up  nasty things.  Trump was recently outed in a video bragging about sexually assaulting women in 1995. Since then, he s gone on to call women fat, slobs, pigs and dogs. He s attacked his sexual assault accusers  looks. The man-baby candidate is whipping his supporters into a frenzy by telling crowds that the election is  rigged.   Trump is a Nasty Man. But thank you, Babin, for mansplaining that women need to be put in their place.The word  genteel  doesn t mean what the Texas lawmaker thinks it means.Image: Gage Skidmore via Flickr",News,"October 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John Cleese Just BURNED Trump Voters For Being The Dumbest People On The Planet (TWEETS),"Trump voters are stupid enough to defend him no matter what he does. As Trump himself has pointed out, he could shoot someone in public and not lose a single vote. This is something Monty Python s John Cleese has noticed over the course of the election   and on Friday morning he voiced his frustration on Twitter.After watching a loyal Trump voter step in to defend The Donald s comment that he greets women he finds beautiful with a kiss and pussy-grab, he couldn t take it anymore.  True stupidity,  he writes.  A Trump supporter,defending his awful taped remarks,said  He would never have said that if he d know he was being recorded. True stupidity a Trump supporter,defending his awful taped remarks,said ""He would never have said that if he'd know he was being recorded""  John Cleese (@JohnCleese) October 21, 2016No f*cking sh*t. People   even Trump   generally avoid being recorded saying horrible things. Naturally, his Twitter followers joined in the mockery:@JohnCleese ""I want a president who's only a sexual predator behind closed doors.""  Thor Benson ?

The sexually gross stuff is for persecuting women in private  Tesla (@MANX38) October 21, 2016@JohnCleese It implies that there are things Trump would never say in public, which is a mind-boggling thought considering what he does say  Henear Kryxerad (@TyphonBaalAmmon) October 21, 2016Cleese has been no stranger to tearing Trump apart, which he has been doing for at least months.

The WHOLE PLANET'S media regard Trump as a coarse,narcissistic,bullying,rambling megalomaniacI forgot Putin  John Cleese (@JohnCleese) October 16, 2016In a recent interview, Cleese  called Trump a  complete clown  with a  dead squirrel  adorning his head, saying the billionaire GOP presidential nominee could have been a character on Monty Python. That confidence that he has   which really comes from a lack of awareness   that is what people are drawn to,  the actor says of Trump.  We have some fairly stupid politicians in England, but we don t approach your scale of stupidity. I m more relaxed now but if I look at the world, I don t think it s ever been in a worse situation. I look at what s going on and there isn t much to be cheerful about,  Cleese says. I look at Trump, and I see a narcissist, with no attention span, who doesn t have clear ideas about anything and makes it all up as he goes along. The actor is exactly right. Trump and his supporters are terrible   but his people will surely be motivated to vote in November.

" Trump Spews FILTH At Charity Event, Audience BOOS Him And CHEERS Hillary (VIDEO)","Democratic and Republican presidential candidates have traditionally gone to New York City s Al Smith Dinner to help raise money for charity and to exchange sharp-tongued  roast  type jokes. But when the event kicked off on Thursday night, Donald Trump decided to head right for the gutter.Instead of light-hearted humor, Trump returned to the well-worn accusations he has peddled for months on the campaign trail. And demonstrating his inability to calmly make jokes or be on the receiving end of them was in full display with Trump yet again.He appeared to straddle the line when he talked about how  listening to Hillary rattle on and rattle on  has made him better appreciate his former nemesis Rosie O Donnell. But he then seemed to cross it when he referred to her as  corrupt  during a lengthy riff on the FBI s investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Hillary is so corrupt she got kicked off the Watergate Commission. How corrupt do you have to be to get kicked off the Watergate Commission? Pretty corrupt,  he said to loud boos and at least one call demanding he get off the stage.Trump is the ultimate  bubble  candidate. He knows how to throw red meat out to his audience of rabid  deplorables , but as the campaign shows so far, he is unable to translate that into mainstream election results.Trump turned a traditionally lighthearted charity event into yet another venue for his bile to go on display and made the watchers both in-house and watching on TV to shudder. There is just about twenty days left of the Trump campaign and they seem dead-set on losing support in any way possible. Insulting every single American comes from a place of special hatred towards the audience, and it seems this is the way Trump has chosen to go out.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Supporter Preparing For ‘WAR’ If Hillary Wins,"Donald Trump set off a lot of alarm bells with his claim in the last presidential debate that he would not graciously concede the election lost unless he had been convinced that the contest was not  rigged,  whatever that means.Commentary from across the political spectrum pointed out that Trump s rhetoric had more in comparison with a dictatorial strongman holding on to power than the democratically elected president of the United States.And now Trump s most diehard supporters are entertaining thoughts of violence if their chosen leader fails to win the race.Jim Moseley is buying extra ammunition and stocking up on canned goods.He is a Donald Trump supporter in South Carolina, and he is preparing for  war.  The civil war he thinks will start if Hillary Clinton is elected president. Once the trucks stop rolling, the grocery shelves will go empty and gasoline rationing will go into effect,  Moseley, who calls himself a  Christian soldier,  wrote in a Facebook message early this week. Liberals will have targets on their backs, as their behaviors are pretty much evident   race wars will begin as well, as your skin color will be your uniform! This is bigger than just Donald Trump, as he is just the latest manifestation of the  paranoid style  on the right, a mindset that has pushed conspiratorial and bizarre ideas for over 50 years. It is the same mindset behind Fox News and its creation by former Nixon aide Roger Ailes, as well as right-wing talk radio and its leading hosts like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh.At a certain point, if you keep telling your most devoted audience that someone is out to get them and they need guns and more to protect themselves and their families, they re going to believe it.Trump s decision to violate the norms of American elections are another sign that he cares more about his ego than the safety of Americans.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Kansas Republican Thought Touting ‘Profound’ Hitler Quote Was A Good Idea – It Wasn’t,"Republicans have a knack for making bad choices, but this one is a whopper. One Kansas Republican thought it would be a good idea to put a post on social media featuring a quote from Adolf Hitler that she deemed  profound. Speaker Pro Tem Peggy Mast, R-Emporia, who happens to also be the No. 3 Republican in the Kansas House, posted the offensive quote to her Facebook page.Great quote from Hitler in the video,  she wrote on Thursday morning, in a post that contained no video.  Please listen to it closely. His words are profound! Let s start using discernment. Christie Kriegshauser, House Speaker Ray Merrick s chief of staff, failed to follow Mast s line of thinking. Sorry, I m confused,  Kriegshauser wrote in response to her first post.  What video and how is there a great quote from Hitler? Although Mast did not return phone calls, she did take to Facebook yet again to, ahem, clarify what she meant by touting quotes from the leader of the Third Reich. She claimed that she  was not in any way agreeing with Hitler s words,  and was just trying to compare him to Planned Parenthood.About an hour later, she added a link to an article from JulieRoys.com, a Christian blog, to her Facebook page. The article contained a video of anti-abortion activist Gianna Jessen giving testimony to Congress regarding Planned Parenthood. In her testimony, Jessen quoted Hitler and argued that he used the same kind of propaganda as the women s health provider. The receptivity of the masses is very limited, their intelligence is small, but their power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these facts, all effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these in slogans until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand by your slogan,  Hitler said in the quote. Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of Kansas Interfaith Action, a group that fights against racism, was also unimpressed with Mast s post. There s nothing profound, and there s no room in American politics for the words or thought of Adolph Hitler,  Reiber said.In one of her Nazi-loving Facebook posts, Mast wrote:  To clarify the intent of my previous post: Planned Parenthood has learned well the same tactics and deception used by Hitler regarding innocent lives.   I was making a connection between the ideology he used and the arguments made by Planned Parenthood. In an email, Laura McQuade, president of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes, wrote that Planned Parenthood  is a trusted health care provider for thousands of Kansans and we reject and condemn Representative Peggy Mast s offensive remarks. Thankfully, Mast is not running for re-election.Featured image via YouTube",News,"October 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Shonda Rhimes Gives Donald Trump A HILARIOUS Education In ‘Late Term Abortion’ (TWEET),"During the last presidential debate, many people were live-tweeting their responses to the candidate s answers. One of those people happened to be the legendary Shonda Rhimes, creator of pretty much every amazing drama on ABC at the moment.During one point in the debate, Donald Trump was talking about late-term abortion. However, he didn t seem to have all his facts right, and he somehow thinks that babies are ripped from the womb in the 9th month.Not being able to refrain from Trump s clear lack of knowledge of women, pregnancy, abortion or the birthing process, Rhimes tweeted out: FYI:  ripping baby from womb in 9th month  is called C-section. #VaginaEducation FYI: ""ripping baby from womb in 9th month"" is called C-section. #VaginaEducation  shonda rhimes (@shondarhimes) October 20, 2016Which is exactly what it is. If a women is nine months pregnant and wants the baby removed, they would do that via C-section, and the baby would be fully developed. If the baby was removed for any other reason that late in the pregnancy it s likely for some tragic reason and Trump really has to keep his orange mouth shut because he has no idea what he s talking about.On the other hand, Hillary Clinton s response during the debate regarding late-term abortion was absolutely on point. She said:Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator I did not think that that was the case. The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who have, toward the end of their pregnancy, get the worst news one could get that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and health of the mother taken into account. However, Trump doesn t seem to care about women or the life of the mother and is instead catering to his dimwitted base who has no knowledge of basic science, let alone what goes on when a woman is pregnant. Nor does he himself even care to know. He just knows how to sell a point to his audience. He is, after all, a scam artist businessman.Good on Rhimes for giving Trump some  Vagina Education    it d be nice if he learned a little about them before just walking up and grabbing them.Featured Photo by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Vulture Festival   Twitter",News,"October 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bette Midler’s Response To Trump Not Accepting Election Results Absolutely MAGICAL (TWEET),"With Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claiming he may not accept the election results on November 8th if he loses to Hillary Clinton, it s left many people criticizing his crybaby behavior.Not only is not accepting the results of our democratic process unpatriotic and dangerous, but it shows what an absolute toddler Trump actually is. He basically believes that if he doesn t win, then Hillary must have cheated. It wouldn t have anything at all to do with the fact that he s a horrible candidate and an even worse human being.Well, not letting this ridiculosity slip by and go unnoticed was the legendary entertainer extraordinaire, Bette Midler. She took to Twitter and gave the Republican candidate a piece of her hilarious mind.Midler tweeted out: Trump sez he may not accept election results if he loses. I don t accept my ass, but guess what s stuffed in the back of my pants right now. Trump sez he may not accept election results if he loses. I don't accept my ass, but guess what's stuffed in the back of my pants right now  Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) October 20, 2016Basically saying, there are a lot of things in life that are hard to accept, but they are in fact true and what is actually going on.Trump needs to realize that the election results are the will of the people and he needs to accept that because that s what s best for the nation as a whole.What is most obvious is the fact that he clearly knows he is going to lose, or he wouldn t be pushing the narrative that the election is rigged as hard as he is. Hopefully, come the evening of November 8th, he does what s right and not what s best for his ego.Featured Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images   Twitter",News,"October 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Carol Costello HUMILIATES Trump Supporter For Whining About Mythical Voter Fraud,"CNN host Carol Costello was so fed up with a Trump s supporter s claims of voter fraud that she threatened to cut the interview short and then destroyed her with facts.Crazy Trump supporter Betsey McCaughey made every effort to squeeze in every little claim of voter fraud she could think of during her appearance on CNN on Thursday. This nation has been victimized by rampant election fraud,  McCaughey declared, citing a Pew report to claim that dead people are voting, forcing Costello to warn her about making claims that are  not true. McCaughey made her claims in defense of Donald Trump s assertion that the election is  rigged  in favor of Hillary Clinton.When Costello and Democratic strategist Sally Kohn ripped into the Republican nominee for refusing to say that he will concede on Election Day if he loses, McCaughey tried to spin it by claiming that Trump didn t say he wouldn t accept the results, only that he would wait until the results come in before he makes a decision.However, her spin is now void because Trump told a crowd in Ohio that he will only accept the results  if I win. When McCaughey continued to falsely claim that there is mass voter fraud in this country, Costello slammed the brakes on the discussion and told McCaughey that if she continues to lie her mic will be cut.COSTELLO:  Stop! Or I m going to have to cut this interview short. McCaughey:  You don t want people to hear the evidence? As McCaughey continued to make her claims, the discussion only became more heated as a frustrated Costello put an end to the discussion and called for a break while producers pulled up some evidence for Costello to hit McCaughey with.Here s the video via YouTube.But McCaughey had no evidence and Costello proved it after the commercial break by playing video of Ohio s Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted saying that Trump s claims are  irresponsible  and that America s system of elections are fair and secure and  we should not question the legitimacy of it. Costello then informed McCaughey that the Pew reports she cited only says that there are dead voters still registered and that the system needs to be updated. It did NOT say that these dead people are voting.Sally Kohn then pointed out that a comprehensive study found that out of one billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014, there were only 31 possible cases of voter fraud.Here s that video via YouTube.In short, voter fraud is a myth perpetuated by Republicans in order to justify voter ID laws designed to suppress voters and as an excuse to explain how Democrats are able to win elections.Donald Trump is using the myth as an excuse to why he would lose to Hillary Clinton and he is making a treasonous mockery of our democratic process by doing so.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Trump Declares He Will Only Accept Election Results ‘If I Win’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump just declared himself a threat to our democracy.During the final presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday night, Republican nominee Donald Trump told moderator Chris Wallace that he will decide on Election Day whether he will accept the results or not.  I will keep you in suspense,  he said.Trump s refusal to say that he would accept the results of the debate no matter what has caused a national outcry and concern that his supporters will cause violence and chaos on Election Day if he loses.And Trump only fanned the flames even more on Thursday when he made a stunning declaration that makes it clear how he will react on November 8th if Hillary Clinton wins. I would to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election   if I win,  Trump said at a rally in Delaware, Ohio.He then pointed at the crowd and they cheered.Here s the video via YouTube.In addition, Trump accused Hillary Clinton s campaign of inciting violence and said hers  is truly a campaign that will do anything to win. This is treason, pure and simple. Donald Trump just openly admitted that he has no intention of conceding if Hillary Clinton wins the election. Instead, he vowed to undermine our democracy and unleash his army of supporters upon the nation, the very supporters who have threatened to violently overthrow the government and assassinate Hillary Clinton if their candidate loses.Donald Trump just disqualified himself, and Republican leaders must denounce him and do everything in their power to remove him from the ballot.This kind of rhetoric is dangerous and could very well end up getting people killed, and that is unacceptable in this country.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Keith Olbermann SKEWERS Trump And GOP For Undermining Our Democracy,"In a video that everyone should see, GQ special correspondent Keith Olbermann had strong words for Donald Trump in response to his refusal to accept defeat if Hillary Clinton wins on Election Day.During the debate in Las Vegas last night, moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump point-blank if he will accept the results of the election. Trump replied by saying that he will have to look at it at the time and that  I will keep you in suspense. In other words, Trump is leaving open the possibility that he will reject the results on Election Day and refuse to concede defeat because he thinks he will be cheated of victory, which gives his rabid supporters the opening to follow through on their threats of bloody violence if the election doesn t go their way.Trump s insistence that the election is  rigged  and his refusal to say that he will accept the results and bow out with dignity like every other losing presidential candidate has done throughout American history is a threat to our democracy and the public safety.And Keith Olbermann was so outraged by Trump s debate answer that he exploded in righteous condemnation.Olbermann said Trump s remarks make him ineligible to run for president and told Trump to  burn in hell  for undermining our sacred democratic tradition of peaceful transfer of power. It was the first time in American history, through dozens of venomous painful campaigns and a series of impossibly close elections, the first and only time that a candidate of a major party had violated the fundamental precept of our democracy. It shakes every one of our freedoms, it mocks every dead American soldier, it spits in every sacrifice made under our flag. It has no comparison,  Olbermann continued, citing Al Gore, Andrew Jackson, and Samuel Tildon as examples of candidates who conceded defeats after close nasty elections. It foments revolution. It was and is the moral equivalent of treason. And this time it slipped passed no one. Not the moderator, not Fox News, not even Breitbart.com. No one. It was not a flash of anger from a man who gets angry once an hour. It was not another slab of red meat thrown to his crazed supporters. It was not another outrageous statement to throw up against the wall in this cheap reality game show version of a presidential campaign. He meant it! He means it! Olbermann made it clear that Trump is a danger to our values and Constitution and he only got angrier as he outed Trump as the unpatriotic sore loser that he is. Donald Trump is not invested in Democracy! Donald Trump is not invested in our Constitution! Donald Trump is not invested in America! Donald Trump is not invested in preventing people from being killed on the streets after an election like this were a Third World police state! Burn. In. Hell! In fact, Trump is so dangerous now that Olbermann called upon Republican leaders to to do everything within legal means to end Trump s candidacy because if they do not, they are responsible for whatever happens on Election Day and after. This is bigger than who is the next president of who is the next RNC chair or who is the next Speaker of the House,  Olbermann declared.  This is our democracy imperiled from within by a man you have permitted to speak for you. Compel him to withdraw! Now! Litigate against him, find enough doctors and have him declared psychiatrically incompetent. At minimum, cut off his funding completely and denounce him in the strongest possible terms because this nightmare, this fascist, this Trump is now your responsibility He must not be allowed the opportunity to keep us in suspense. Here s the video via Twitter.NEW: after he again subverts the sanctity of our elections, my message to @realDonaldTrump: Burn. In. Hell. pic.twitter.com/q2gvPAgq9P  Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) October 20, 2016Donald Trump is insane and his supporters are insane enough that they may end up committing acts of bloody violence whether Trump concedes or not. That s how deranged they are because of Trump s rhetoric.The Republican Party needs to be severely punished at the polls for this on Election Day.

 America’s Most Corrupt Sheriff Set To Lose Re-Election Bid In A LANDSLIDE,"Two days ago, a poll from the Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News had Democrat Paul Penzone beating out Republican Joe Arpaio for the office of Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona. Arpaio, who is seeking his seventh term, has branded himself America s  toughest  sheriff.He also has a reputation for being a lawless thug who uses racial discrimination to crack down on illegal immigration.In just two days, Arizonans have gone further with their dissatisfaction with America s  toughest sheriff. A brand new poll from the Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News, released early Thursday, shows Democrat Paul Penzone s lead growing astronomically. In just two days, Penzone has gone from a 10 point lead to a 15 point lead over Arpaio, 46 to 31 percent. Penzone skyrocketed in the polls after reports surfaced that federal prosecutors will charge him with criminal contempt after a judge recommended the charges stemming from a racial profiling case   in which the court found Arpaio and his posse willfully disobeyed the court s order not to racially profile.In August, a poll conducted by Cronkite found that 57.3 percent of registered voters in Maricopa county either found Arpaio  unfavorable  or  very unfavorable.  That was before it was announced that federal prosecutors would be charging him for breaking the law.The same poll released on Thursday also shows that 68 percent of Arizonans do not agree with deporting every illegal immigrant living in the state.Arpaio was first elected sheriff in 1992 and has won every election since. However, every election has shown Arpaio losing support. In 2000, Arpaio won with 65 percent of the vote. In 2012, the last election, he barely clinched a majority, just passing the 50 percent mark.Never before has a Democratic challenger surpassed Arpaio in the polls. Considering Clinton has a real shot at winning Arizona, and the two most recent polls show Arpaio losing by double digits, Arizona may become just a little bluer than ever before.And what a big F-You that would send to Trump s xenophobic, racist movement. Losing the state affected by illegal immigration the most and sending it s most ardent racist home with it. Forty-four percent of residents in Maricopa county do not support  the wall  Trump and Arpaio want to build, while only 13 percent do.Arizona, get ready to say goodbye to Joe Arpaio!Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"October 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump SEETHING After Congressman Obliterates Him For ‘Nasty Woman’ Debate Insult (TWEETS),"There were many notable moments from last night s presidential debate thanks to Republican nominee Donald Trump, who made it a debate to remember (not necessarily a good thing, in his case). Not only did Trump imply that he would not accept the election s results if he was defeated by Hillary Clinton, but he once again proved that he has ZERO respect for women when he insulted her on the debate stage.Ironically, this attack came after Trump insisted that  no one has more respect for women than I do . Clinton had been talking about Social Security and Medicare, and Trump jumped in to interrupt so he could call her  such a nasty woman.  It was a completely random attack, and the perfect display of Trump s lack of self control and misogyny in action.As soon as it happened, social media exploded with rage as Americans rushed to criticize Trump s blatant disrespect of not only the former Secretary of State, but women everywhere. It wasn t long before the hashtag #nastywoman was being used far and wide, slamming the business mogul for his sexist outburst. One response, however, has Trump particularly p*ssed off. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said it best when he tweeted: Women who disagree with you aren t  nasty.  In this case, they are what is known as  right.' TwitterHell yes. And we all know how much fragile Donald HATES being proven wrong! More politicians jumped into the conversation on Trump s dangerous attitude toward women while watching the debate. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) also came forward to point out how dishonest Trump s remarks about respecting women were. Her attack was flawless:TwitterIf you look at any interview, footage, etc. of Trump talking about women before or during his presidential campaign, it is extremely rare that you ll find him saying something nice about them   much less respecting them. Trump has a horrifying long history of degrading, objectifying, insulting and belittling women, as well as a track record of sexually assaulting them. This man is dangerous for women and he is dangerous for America   everything he says and does proves that he cannot and should not be our next President.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"October 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sarah Palin Calls For Executing Democratic ‘Cheaters’ On Election Day,"Sarah Palin agrees with Donald Trump that Democrats will somehow cheat to help Hillary Clinton win on Election Day, and her final solution is to kill them.In a post-debate rant on Facebook, America s village idiot wrote that Trump is  wise  for refusing to say whether he will accept the election results on November 8th if Hillary Clinton wins.During the debate, the Republican nominee said everyone will just have to wait and see because he wants to keep America in  suspense. His answer was outrageous and unpatriotic because if Trump chooses to reject the results on Election Day and claim that the contest was rigged, he would not only be causing a Constitutional crisis, his supporters have already threatened to attempt a bloody violent coup and an effort to assassinate Clinton.But Sarah Palin is okay with this. Seems silly media sheep are all chomping down on one issue after this debate, at least according to all the reporters who hollered out this same question to me:  What about Trump not accepting the election results?  Palin wrote.More power to Trump for explaining how vitally important the legitimacy of every election is to our democracy within our Republic.What reasonable person would preemptively accept any and all hypothetical questions and conditions of any hypothetical election? Trump s answer was RIGHT.Every American s sacred vote MUST be respected and legitimized in today s elections   but they must be FAIR elections. We re in the midst of proof of voter fraud and questionable   even violent   participatory elements in campaigns. That s why state legislators are now cracking down on voter fraud via tighter laws ensuring the security of our elections.When Trump is pressed on this, it harkens back to all the GOP primary candidates who screamed at Trump to support the Republican nominee   no matter what   and Trump initially responded that he could, depending on fair treatment. That is WISE and INSIGHTFUL! Trump got screwed in that deal when he eventually pledged to support the nominee and then some of his fellow candidates turned tail and refused to reciprocate when Trump won.Trump learned   why give opponents permission and incentive to act unfairly and cheat? It s shortsighted to commit to accepting the outcome of a race REGARDLESS of unscrupulous cheaters. How totally unfair that would be to the American voter!Except that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in this country despite what Palin and Trump claim. In fact, a comprehensive study found that out of one billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014 only 31 cases of fraud were found.And then Palin echoed Trump supporters with the following threat. Trump gave potential cheaters fair warning that we ll not give them any quarter,  she wrote.  We ll hold them accountable. They d better be on their toes. Cheaters will not win. Here s her full rant via Facebook.Trump has basically accused minority and Democratic voters of being cheaters, which means Sarah Palin just called for executing anyone that Trump s poll watching-thugs accuse of cheating on Election Day, and that includes Hillary Clinton and members of the media.You might point out that Palin didn t use the words  execute  or  kill,  however, she specifically said that  we ll not give them any quarter. No quarter is a term that is defined as follows:In war, a victor gives no quarter (or takes no prisoners) when the victor shows no clemency or mercy and refuses to spare the life of a vanquished opponent in return for their surrender at discretion (unconditional surrender).So, yes, Sarah Palin is among the Trump supporters who are threatening violent rebellion if the election does not go Trump s way.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Court Forces Ohio To Allow Millions Of Illegally Purged Voters Back On The Rolls,"Donald Trump is semi-right: this election might be rigged. However, this election is rigged against the people, not him.Take a look at Ohio, a key battleground state in the never-ending 2016 election. After purging more than two million voters from the roles, a high court smacked down Republican Secretary of State John Hustad for violating the National Voter Registration Act.Hustad s purge, which included some dead people and those who moved out of state, also included those who moved in the same county and those who have not voted in past elections (at least since 2011). Those who were purged were overwhelmingly black, low-income and Democratic voters. A Reuters investigation found that in the state s major cities (Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati) the voters in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods and precincts were illegally purged at twice the rate as in Republican.So, on Wednesday night, while everyone was watching the final presidential debate (in which Trump again claimed the election is rigged against him), the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, at the behest of Republican appointee Judge George C. Smith, ordered the voters   save the dead and moved   back onto the rolls immediately and have their voting rights restored.Judge Smith accused Hustad of voter disenfranchisement, writing:If those who were unlawfully removed from the voter rolls are not allowed to vote, then the Secretary of State is continuing to to disenfranchise voters in violation of federal law.The case was originally heard by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which also ruled against Hustad, but was sent back to the District Court for a rehearing. Obviously, both courts realized the illegal power grab by the state at the behest of the GOP, and they weren t having it.Time and time again the courts have struck down illegal rigging practices by the Republicans, thus saving the nation from an unbalanced electoral system. Voting is a right in this country, and partisan politicos should not have the power to take it away just because.If anyone can complain about a rigged election, it s Hillary Clinton.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"October 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Van Jones Epically SCOLDS Trump Supporters For Defending ‘Rigged Election’ Debate Talk,"When Donald Trump s CNN stooges tried to defend his remarks about whether he would accept the results of the election or not, Van Jones scolded them into humiliation.Donald Trump s debate performance once again suffered because of his big mouth and his refusal to stop claiming that the election is  rigged  against him.When asked by moderator Chris Wallace on Wednesday night if he will concede defeat if the election results favor Hillary Clinton, Trump stunned everyone by basically leaving the question into an Election Day cliffhanger. I will look at it at the time,  Trump said.  I will keep you in suspense. Trump s refusal to accept the democratic process is dangerous and is totally unprecedented in the history of our country. Whoever loses the election has always conceded defeat and acknowledged the winner as the president-elect.But Trump may do the opposite and refuse to accept the results, which could touch off a Constitutional crisis as well as riots and acts of violence by Trump supporters in protest of their candidate s defeat.Trump supporters Jeffrey Lord and Kayleigh McEnany, however, actually tried defending Trump s toddler-like behavior during CNN s post-debate discussion. And Van Jones was having none of it.He ripped both of Trump s mouthpieces to shreds and shamed them for defending a man who is unpatriotic and a disgrace to American Democracy. This is a really sad night,  Jones said.  This is a very sad night for the country. You can t polish this turd. I m going to be very, very clear about this. Al Gore respected the Constitution, respected the process, respected every voter. He went to our Supreme Court, asked for a resolution on his own terms as did George W. Bush. And when the election results were certified, he told his party and base to stand down and accept this, even though a lot of us were very, very upset. What you just got now was the nominee of a major party for the first time in our history signaling to the American people that he has so little faith in our institutions, that he has so little faith in our people, and so little faith in our courts, and so little faith in the Republican governors, the Republican secretaries of state across this country that he will not stand in front of his own country, in front of his own nation and say that he respects the process and the outcome. Indeed, despite a close race in 2000 that could have gone Gore s way had the Supreme Court allowed the recount to continue, the former vice-president accepting the Court s decision and conceded the race, something Trump may actually refuse to do on November 8th even if he loses by a landslide.Trump s refusal to say that he will accept the results of the election if he loses angered Jones tremendously, enough that he called Trump  unpatriotic  and told Lord and McEnany that they should be ashamed of themselves for defending him. That is an outrage! The appalling lack of patriotism from this man. The appalling lack of patriotism of this man to say this and praise Putin and Assad more than he has ever praised any American president. He doesn t talk about George Washington, He doesn t talk about Ronald Reagan the way he talks about Putin and Assad. This man has demonstrated an appalling lack of patriotism and you should be ashamed to defend it. Here s the video via VidMe.At this point, anyone who has defended Trump should be ashamed of themselves, and frankly, none of them should be able to get a job after this election is over. The things Donald Trump has said over the course of this campaign are indefensible and embarrassing. As Americans, Lord and McEnany should be embarrassed by their candidate s temper tantrums and outrageous claims. But they are not, and that s why Van Jones took it upon himself to put them in their place.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Said Hillary Is The Reason He’s Branded As A Sexual Predator,"In the last debate, Trump had to answer for the allegations that he d sexually assaulted women, which came out on tape courtesy of David Farenthold at the Washington Post. He was just asked about it again, and now, not only are all these allegations false, according to The Donald, but Hillary is behind all of it.He thinks Hillary and her campaign are the reason that he s now called a sexual predator.No, really. We are not even kidding. He said that during tonight s debate: First of all, the stories have been largely debunked. Those people, I don t know those people. I have a feeling how they came I believe it was her campaign that did it. Did what? Hillary contacted all of them, coerced them into accusing Trump of sexual assault, and then put it under a spotlight? Is that what he s saying?He would, no doubt, say no. However, he also claims that Hillary and Obama paid people to cause violence at his rallies: They hired people. They paid them fifteen hundred dollars and they re on tape saying be violent cause fights do bad things. Really? He extended that to Hillary, and now he seriously thinks Hillary planted people to accuse him of sexual assault to bolster her campaign. With that nonsense, there s no way to believe anything he says about his victims.Six witnesses from People just came forward, saying they know that Natasha Stoynoff s story is true. He s on tape saying that he kisses beautiful women without waiting for them to consent. He said,  Grab them by the pussy. Whatever,  when talking about how women let him do whatever he wants because he s a star.And Hillary s responsible for him being branded a sexual predator? Oh, please.Featured image by Scott Olson via Getty Images",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Said The Most Racist Thing Imaginable About Latino Immigrants,"The only way that Trump can talk about immigration, and immigrants, is in racist terms. For someone other than, well, someone in a position of power, it d probably be easy to explain his use of the term,  bad hombres,  as simple ignorance. Maybe. With him and his racist tendencies, though,it s not, and he proved that during the final presidential debate.In talking about undocumented immigrants and the crime they re supposedly committing, he said: But we have some bad hombres here that were going to get them out. Because that s what everyone wants, supposedly. What he misses isn t just that his border wall and deportation force plans aren t realistic   he also misses the fact that saying,  bad hombres,  is horribly racist. Why is that?Using a culture s own language to attack them is inherently racist.  Hombre  means  man,  in Spanish, and specifically refers to  tough men.  But using it against them like that is to demean the entire race and the entire culture.Trump doesn t care, though. He has a very long and well-documented history of racism. He doesn t care what he says, but there he is, up on that stage, calling undocumented immigrants  bad hombres,  for the purpose of painting Latinos as inherently bad people.That s not a U.S. president.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Brainless Misogynist: Women Wouldn’t Need Tampons If They Had Any Self-Control,"A 19-year old kid is upset about the debate over the U.K. s  tampon tax,  because he considers tampons to be luxury items. Why are tampons luxury items in his world? Incredibly enough, it s not because men don t need them. It s because, in this kid s eyes, women should just not bleed until they re able to get to a toilet. Because, you know, periods totally work that way.It might seem like this is satire, but it s not. This kid actually does think this way, despite having a girlfriend. He said: People are saying tampons shouldn t be taxed because they are a necessity but why can t those women just learn to control their bladders?If they are going to bleed then they should wait until they get to the toilet. It s all about self-control.If you can t control your bladder then that s not the taxpayers  problem. I don t urinate everywhere and expect free nappies. For this nonsense, he earned an awful lot of what he calls hate, and that s not surprising at all. He needs a biology lesson and everyone who s said so is right. Despite his obvious deficiencies, Ryan fancies himself a politician and  politics expert,  and says on his Instagram account,  Making the #meninist movement mainstream once again.  The meninist movement is basically the men s rights movement, which is full of poor, put-upon guys who think women are oppressing them and are the devil.The comments on the picture below, via his Instagram account, explain it all:Bumped into @brooklynbeckham #brooklynbeckhamA photo posted by @ryanwilliams97 on Sep 20, 2016 at 2:43pm PDTEven that doesn t stop him, though. In response to what he no doubt sees as the preposterous idea that he doesn t know anything about biology here, he said: People have told me that I must have skipped biology lessons but I don t understand how that is relevant. I have even had death threats.People are saying it isn t dirty, it s natural but urine and faeces are natural and still dirty. It s utter hypocrisy. He s thrilled that men agree with him on the issue of tampon taxes, because of course they do, and that may have swelled his head because he s as egotistical as he clueless. He actually said on his Facebook page:  For TV requests, contact me directly. He s also been dumb enough to start what can only be termed a sarcastic GoFundMe campaign for biology lessons, which he proved he needs because he still can t understand why women can t just hold their bladders. He believes we re all lazy because we don t, and has the most bizarre example of why it s just a matter of self control: My gorgeous Toy Poodle, castrated when she was a puppy to stop the periods and to prevent any aggression PMT would give her.If your bladder is too weak  which clearly it is for most of you, then see a doctor and have the same procedure. What does that even mean? You can t castrate a female   he s suggesting that women get hysterectomies to stop their periods. This guy thinks we actually like bleeding for a week every single month for most of our lives. Or, at the very least, that we don t mind it. Then again, he also says his girlfriend never bleeds. Too bad his GoFundMe isn t serious. He s in dire need of those biology lessons.Featured image via screen capture from embedded photo",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie HILARIOUSLY Trolls Paul Ryan On Twitter – All While Helping Down-Ballot Dems (TWEET),"Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is in full campaign mode, and it shows. He s also having a high old time trolling House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is under a seemingly crippling amount of stress due to his own party s buffoonish nominee, Donald Trump.Earlier in the week, Ryan spoke to a group of young Republicans in his home state of Wisconsin, and had dire warnings regarding what could happen if Democrats take back the Senate: that their worst nightmare would come true, and Bernie would be heading up the Budget Committee. Ryan said to the University of Wisconsin students: If we lose the Senate, do you know who becomes the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee? A guy named Bernie Sanders. You ever heard of him? Ryan s remarks were not missed by Bernie. He tweeted: I heard what @SpeakerRyan said: If the GOP loses the Senate, I ll be the Budget chairman. Sounds like a good idea. Here is the tweet:I heard what @SpeakerRyan said: If the GOP loses the Senate, I'll be the Budget chairman. Sounds like a good idea. https://t.co/9EFfzgimCX  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 19, 2016Aside from the obvious trolling, the best thing about the tweet is that it links to an opportunity to donate to Democratic candidates for the United States Senate. This is entirely possible, since Democrats only need to pick up five seats to take the Senate   four if we take the White House, since the Vice President is the tie-breaker in votes.Hopefully, Donald Trump continues to tear the GOP apart, and Paul Ryan s warning becomes a glorious reality for Democrats and assorted left-wingers everywhere.Featured image via Darren McCollester/Getty Images",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Man Just Exposed A Sorry Truth About A Vital Part Of Trump’s Campaign,"We ve been drowning in the final stretch of this presidential election cycle since August. At three weeks out, both candidates should have their ground games well-established, and even be working overtime in a lot of cases, to reach as many voters as possible. Apparently, though, none of this is true for Trump. Like his outward campaign, his ground game has no cohesion or organization at all, and what few volunteers there are don t seem to care about the actual business of campaigning for a presidential candidate: [T]hese people cared more about the reality show Trump had created, then [sic] the reality of the campaign itself. That s what Scott David Shapiro, who maintains a news blog on Medium, said after he embarked on a suicide mission to see if Trump s ground game was as  big league  as he was making it sound.First things first   it took Trump forever to open up local campaign offices a move especially perplexing in swing states where he needs a ground game and Shapiro wanted to see just what was going on after he heard that such offices were finally opening.His first stop was in Mesa, Arizona. Not quite a swing state, but in play because Trump is so awful. He immediately ran into problems when he got there. He had an address, but no phone number and the Arizona Republican Party didn t have a number either. Strange. Shapiro soldiered on with the info he had, and this is what happened: [W]hen I arrived at 1234 S. Power Road, I found a large office complex  with no cars in the parking lot. This struck me as odd considering the office was supposed to be open 7 days a week. But I pressed on, finding myself standing in front of Suite 251.This was supposed to be the Trump Victory Office, but I stood there confused as there was nothing on door indicating it as such. Then, I peered through the half-drawn blinds, noticing a ceiling fan was spinning inside. So, I took a deep breath, reached for the handle and opened the door  walking right into a COMPLETELY EMPTY ROOM. WTF? He went on to say that he finally found someone in there, but that one, single person could only say,  I think you re in the wrong place. Um. What?Anyway. Strike one, and Shapiro was off to find the next office, which had just opened up in Long Beach, CA, at the Cambodian Cultural Center. Hokay, then. That sounds like a really odd place for a presidential campaign s local office, but minority outreach, maybe?Shapiro had to go there TWICE to actually find the office, and when he did: [T]here was no  big-league  ground game to be found. This office was strictly the minors. Neither of the tiny, two staff operation had ever run a campaign office before. And it showed  they were selling yard signs for 25 bucks a pop when they should be given out for free for fuck s sake!I told them I had previous campaign experience, and they practically rolled out the red carpet for me. Completely unvetted, they placed me at the front desk, where I sat by my lonesome for an hour. In this office, he was very quickly tapped to participate on a three-person  debate the debate  panel when nobody even knew his name. He volunteered there for two weeks, astonished that all the bluster from Trump supporters and campaign staff had amounted to a severe lack of anything resembling a ground game.Finally, a friend of Shapiro s in Tampa mentioned a Trump Victory Office there, and oh my god! Trump is opening these offices all over Florida, right where they need to be! So Shapiro packed his bags again and headed down to Florida: [W]hen I arrived at the Trump Victory South Tampa office, I realized there was nothing to fear but fear itself. Unbelievably, this office had even less going on in it then freaking Long Beach! Sure, there were more staff members, but volunteers were few and far between Day after day, the excuses for the lack of bodies started to pile up, ranging from Republicans were too busy because they had JOBS to Hurricane Matthew s imminent arrival. But the hurricane came and went with nary a raindrop in Tampa. And then the  Access Hollywood  tape that proved Trump is a sexual predator came out, and the office just ground to a halt, according to Shapiro. Excuses for why people weren t coming in to volunteer turned to great weather and sports, but the fact was that the  boots on the ground  that Trump implied were everywhere just weren t anywhere.It s not just Shapiro s blog post. He tweeted about his progress throughout this project, and also found someone else who was trying to locate Trump s  ground game. Yet, when it came to debate parties, turnout was yuuuuge, showing Shapiro that Trump s supporters are  all talk and no action.  This was true even for the second debate, which was after the  Access Hollywood  tape came out. They re there for the glitz and glamour, but when it comes to doing real work, they avoid it like the plague.Featured image by Kena Betancur via Getty Images",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Ivanka Just Threw Her Father Under The Campaign Bus: ‘I’m NOT A Surrogate’ (VIDEO),"Hours before the third and final presidential debate, even Trump s own daughter is trying to distance herself from her father s failing campaign.During Fortune s The Most Powerful Women Summit, Ivanka Trump was asked about the role she has taken on as one of the most visible members of the inner circle of a Republican nominee who just in the last two weeks has body shamed a Miss Universe contestant and appeared in that [Access Hollywood] tape and suggested that other women that accused him were too unattractive [for him] to have assaulted. My brand was launched far before the presidential cycle commenced,  Ivanka responded.  And I ve always tried to maintain complete separation between that and the campaign. I hate the word surrogate,  she added.  Because what does that mean? When people talk about I m his confidante   at one point, major newspapers were writing that I was a vice presidential candidate. I m saying, no, I m a daughter. She also said that except for childcare and women s rights, she keeps her views on policy  to herself. She then reiterated that she does not consider herself to be a Republican. But I m not a surrogate,  she insisted.  I m a daughter. I stood in front of the [Republican National Convention] and shared that I m an independent, which is very consistent with many other millennials. But I do dismiss this idea of a surrogate because I don t think it appreciates the role that I m playing as my father s daughter  I m not the campaign mastermind.

 Ivanka Won’t Defend Trump’s “Rigged” Election Claims In AWKWARD Pre-debate Interview (VIDEO),"Things started to fall apart faster than ever just hours before Donald Trump would face off against Hillary Clinton in the final presidential debate.As everyone geared up and prepared for one of the most monumental moments of this election cycle, Ivanka Trump was stuck trying to defend her father s ridiculous whiney complaints at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit this afternoon. While the event was certainly not focused on Trump, he would undoubtedly come up in conversation, as America has never had a candidate that hates and disrespects women to the degree that Trump has.However, it seems that even Ivanka may be fed up with defending her father s outrageous acts and comments. When Ivanka was questioned about her father s insistence that this election has been rigged against him, Ivanka refused to back up his claims and instead tried to pivot the conversation away from The Donald s voter fraud conspiracy. Instead, Trump s favorite (and most lusted after) daughter avoided the question and said: I will tell you that the media has been vicious. Ivanka then went into a cringe-worthy rant about how the media s reports weren t  fair and fact-checked  and that Trump s campaign has been held to  a different level  than what is normally allowed (did she mean a much lower level?).As her embarrassing response dragged on, Ivanka also tried to insist that somehow her father s campaign hasn t permanently ruined the Trump brand, which is pretty preposterous. While Trump may have attracted racists, misogynists and white power advocates, the majority of America is appalled by Trump and his views and this will undoubtedly be reflected in the future of Trump s businesses. You can watch Ivanka try to get out of answering the Trump question below:[ad3media campaign= 1187 ]Poor Ivanka, always being forced to clean up the messes of Daddy Dearest.

 WATCH: Chris Hardwick BURNS Melania Trump For Complaining About ‘Negativity’ On Social Media,"@Midnight host Chris Hardwick found it very amusing to listen to Melania Trump complain about how  damaging  social media is to children when her own husband says incredibly offensive and outrageous things on Twitter every day. Yesterday, Anderson Cooper interviewed former divorcee Melania Trump and asked her what she d try to accomplish if she becomes First Lady,  Hardwick began his show on Tuesday night before playing a clip of Melania talking about how she wants to change social media. The social media, it s very damaging for the children,  she claimed.  We need to guide them and teach them about social media because I see a lot of negativity on it. Yeah, that s right. Melania Trump actually wants to focus her time as First Lady cleaning up the  negativity  on social media. But does that include her own husband s Twitter account?Because as Hardwick proceeded to point out, Donald Trump has been posting remarks that go far beyond negative ever since he joined the platform in 2009. I wonder why she thinks there s a lot of negativity on social media,  Hardwick said before scrolling through images of Trump s Twitter posts.  I don t know, maybe it s because one of the only people she follows does stuff like call other people  unattractive both inside and out,  or  a low class slob,  or  a dopey clown,  or  a total asshole,  or  a p*ssy,  or  they look like shit,  or  disgusting with nipples protruding.' Hardwick then delivered the perfect advice to Melania if she really wants to make social media less negative. Why would Melania wait until she s First Lady to reduce negativity on social media when she could just as easily replace her husband s phone with an exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Hardwick then turned to the comedians on the panel and asked them what other goals Melania has, which included  designing grab-proof women s underwear  and  whatever goals Michelle Obama has. Here s the video via Comedy Central.Just like her husband, Melani Trump should really stop talking. Because every time they open their mouths, comedians get new material to mercilessly mock them with.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 OOPS: Donald Trump’s Debate Guest Supports Terrorist Group That Wants To Kill All Jews,"This lack of oversight proves that Donald Trump is totally unfit to be president.Earlier this week, the Republican nominee winked at birthers by inviting President Obama s estranged Kenyan Muslim half-brother as his honored guest for Wednesday night s debate between himself and Hillary Clinton.It s Trump s way of trolling President Obama and giving a not so subtle shout-out to all the conservatives out there who believe the sitting President of the United States is a secret Muslim who was not born here in America.But Trump and his campaign team clearly did not do their homework on Malik Obama, because despite Trump s claims that he will be tough on terrorism, Trump s guest is allegedly a supporter of Hamas, an anti-Israel group that denies the Holocaust and commits acts of terrorism to achieve their ultimate goal of wiping Israel off the map.The Times of Israel reports,In January 2014 the Daily Mail uncovered a photograph showing Malik Obama with a traditional Arab headscarf decorated with slogans of the Palestinian terror group Hamas.The scarf, called a keffiyeh, was draped around Obama s neck and carried the Arabic phrases for  Jerusalem is ours   we are coming  and  From the river to the sea,  both popular Hamas chants.The photograph was taken at a 2010 conference in Yemen.Here s the image via Twitter.Trump fan & estranged Obama bro wears Hamas scarf blaring  Jerusalem is ours-we are coming  &  From the river to the sea  (@Green_Footballs) pic.twitter.com/npZh1AvcsZ  Noga Tarnopolsky (@NTarnopolsky) October 19, 2016On inviting Malik Obama to the debate, Trump has said  I look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik. He gets it far better than his brother. Trump apparently doesn t get it at all.After spending all of that time accusing President Obama of supporting terrorists and hating Israel, Trump literally is welcoming a man who actually does as a supporter of his campaign.Wow.

 MUTINY: Even Trump’s Own Employees Are Saying They’ll Vote For Hillary (VIDEO),"Donald Trump supporters often say that they are voting for the bombastic self-proclaimed billionaire because he s a job creator. Perhaps he is a job creator, but many of his employees think he s a horrible boss and a few brave women are appearing on a video to tell the nation all about it.Celia Vargas is an immigrant from El Salvador. Trump supporters would likely hate her. Trump rails about people like Vargas on the campaign trial. She crossed the Mexican border and arrived in the United States during the Reagan administration, in 1981. She remained an undocumented worker until 1986, when Reagan gave her and others like her amnesty.Now, she s an employee of Trump s Vegas Strip hotel and she can t stand her boss. She ll be voting for Hillary Clinton. So will many of her coworkers. We clean the rooms every single day for Mr. Trump, so he can be rich and he has no respect for us. I will vote for Ms. Hillary Clinton, and my family, too,  says Vargas, who was 23 when she came to the United States illegally.  She fights for keeping families together, she fights for the younger people, for Dreamers. Source: CNNIt s not just immigrants who appear on the video. Jeffrey Wise is a guest room attendant at the Trump s Las Vegas hotel. Superficially, Wise looks like a Trump supporter. He s white. His gray hair reveals his age. More significantly, he s a Republican. He s voting for Clinton. You say your employees love you,  said Wise,  what we d like to know is why you don t love your employees back.The allegations against Trump as an employer should have killed his campaign a long time ago. There are multiple accounts of his not paying his employees and contractors at all. Trump is also a union buster, which I suppose isn t a problem for his supporters, but what should be is this:Trump s staff is heavily comprised of immigrants whose terms of work lag behind union hospitality workers in benefits, wages, and job security.Of course, caring about hotel workers would require empathy, something Trump supporters know nothing about.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images.",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: MSNBC Host TORCHES Trump Campaign Manager To A Crisp For 18 Glorious Minutes,"Defending Satan is hard. That s what Kellyanne Conway learned during an appearance on MSNBC on Wednesday morning.With eleven hours to go before the third presidential debate kicks off, host Stephanie Ruhle relentlessly grilled Donald Trump s campaign manager on everything from the Republican nominee s claims that the election is  rigged  to the sexual assault allegations against him to him inviting President Obama s estranged half-brother to the debate.Ruhle began by asking Conway if she really believes there will be widespread fraud on Election Day. Conway responded by breaking with her boss.  No, I don t believe that,  she said but she went on to suggest that there is a conspiracy to defeat Trump among Clinton and some members of the media. Specifically, Conway cited James O Keefe and his selectively edited undercover videos as proof of Trump s claims.Ruhle called out Trump for misleading the American people. Conway tried to spin by pointing to Trump s recent introduction of an ethics plan for government, but Ruhle was skeptical because Trump could have introduced such a plan months ago but is only doing it now.Conway whined about how the media is supposedly ignoring Trump s plans but Ruhle was not having it, noting that while the media has covered Trump s policy plans, he has made it difficult for them to do so by making wild claims and saying offensive things such as his various insults aimed at women, which Ruhle talked about next.Ruhle asked Conway if she is offended by Trump s remark about grabbing women  by the pussy.  She acknowledged that she is offended but she also lied by claiming that no one in Trump s campaign has tried to defend or condone his remarks when many of his surrogates have tried to write off his comments as mere  locker room talk. Ruhle then moved on to the sexual allegations against Trump, especially those made by a People magazine contributor. Trump has repeatedly called her a liar and attacked her but it turns out there are six witnesses who can corroborate her accusations that he groped her and forcibly tried to kiss her. When there are six people corroborating the People magazine story you still say her word against his?  Ruhle said.  You ve got to look at your kids when you go home at night. Conway complained that it was fair for Ruhle to say that to her because  I get that from a lot of childless people worrying about my kids  but Ruhle actually has three kids, whom she says are not allowed to watch Trump speak because she is afraid he will say offensive things about women.Conway countered by claiming that Hillary Clinton has not done anything for women, which again, is a lie.According to Huffington Post,Globally, no candidate has done more for women s rights than Secretary Clinton. In her time as Secretary of State, she appointed the first-ever Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women s Issues at the State Department; oversaw the creation of the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security; and introduced the Global Health Initiative (GHI), investing $63 billion to help partner countries provide robust maternal and infant health services.Hillary is also a strong supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment and voted for the Lily Ledbetter Act and Paycheck Fairness Act when she was a United States Senator.She also fought for over-the-counter contraception and expanding Medicaid for family planning services.In short, her record of achievement is long when it comes to women.Conway also bragged about Hillary Clinton not reaching 65 percent support among women, but the fact is that she has a 19-point lead over Trump among women 53-34 in a new CBS poll. If the election were held today, it would be the largest margin of victory among women in history, even surpassing President Obama s wins in 2008 and 2012.For some reason, Conway also tried to criticize Hillary for  hanging out  with billionaires like Mark Cuban just because she has their support. Ruhle was quick to smack Conway down by pointing out that Trump is a billionaire who actually does hang out with billionaires.Conway also took heavy fire from Ruhle after saying that Hillary Clinton  isn t an American success story  even though she is the first woman in history to be a major party s nominee for president.Here s the video via YouTube.Overall, Conway really took a beating in this interview. She lied multiple times all while trying to soften Trump s claims, which really undermines them more than anything else.Donald Trump is unfit to be president and, quite frankly, anyone who worked for his campaign should never be able to work in politics or in the media ever again, and that includes Kellyanne Conway. They have done nothing but poison the democratic process while demonizing the press that is responsible for vetting candidates. That only weakens our country and it s unforgivable.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Poll Shows Hillary Leading Trump With This Surprising Demographic For The First Time Ever,"Until today, not one national poll had Clinton leading with male voters. Some have gotten close, but Donald Trump has always managed to lock it up. The gender gap that we have seen the last several elections was looking like a repeat for 2016.But now a new poll released the day of the third and final presidential debate shows Clinton now   for the first time   is leading with men. The newest poll from Bloomberg Politics shows Clinton edging out Trump by 2 points with men (46 to 44) and 9 points overall (47-38).The poll was conducted from October 14-17 with responses from 1,006 likely voters.So a week after the game-changing audio tape was leaked   in which Trump admits to sexually assaulting women   men have started to turn against the Republican nominee, and for good reason.Clinton is already gaining in Republican strongholds   white, college educated women, Cuban-Americans, young Republicans, Vietnamese-Americans, and now men. Such gains have turned traditionally red states like Arizona, Georgia and Texas into reachable victories for Democrats.With Trump under-performing Romney in key swing states (and red states), Trump cannot afford to lose his key voting demographics, but the damage from the tape and the accusations of sexual assault have hurt him tremendously.Republican men have distanced themselves from Trump after the revelations were leaked, invoking their wives and daughters and granddaughters as reasons they cannot support the GOP nominee. It s not clear if the shift in male support for Clinton comes from Independent or Republican defectors, but the numbers are slowly inching Clinton s way.With less than 20 days until election day, Trump is going to have to pivot hard if he hopes of bringing back all the defectors into his camp. With early voting already underway, in which millions have already cast their ballots, the window of opportunity may have passed.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren Just SHREDDED Trump For Being A ‘Sore Loser’ Before Election Is Even Over,"Have you noticed that Donald Trump has opted to not attack or retaliate against Elizabeth Warren for quite some time? That s because the Massachusetts Senator is a professional truth teller whose epic tweetstorms put the Republican nominee in his place each and every time.Indeed, every time Trump has insulted Warren on Twitter she has absolutely destroyed him. But Warren didn t shred Trump this time over mere insults against her. She did it because Trump is trying to undermine our democratic system by calling the election  rigged  against him.Despite the fact that study after study encompassing many years and over one billion votes has found that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in our country, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the media and Hillary Clinton have fixed the election in her favor.Well, Warren has something to say about Trump s whining and she used strong words to call him out, calling him a  sore loser  who is acting like a petulant child who isn t getting their way.Give me a break, @realDonaldTrump. You re not losing because it s rigged. You re losing because we see through your creepy bullying.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016Anyone with children knows that whining about imaginary cheating is the last refuge of the sore loser, @realDonaldTrump.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016You can t run a campaign based on hating women, African Americans, Muslims & immigrants & expect to win, @realDonaldTrump.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016It s not rigged, @realDonaldTrump. You re losing fair & square. Put on your big-boy pants because this is what accountability looks like.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016But @realDonaldTrump didn t come up with the  rigged  election himself. It s a longtime effort by the @GOP to delegitimize @TheDemocrats.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016It s fascinating, @realDonaldTrump:  voter fraud  only seems to plague places where lots of people might vote for @TheDemocrats.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016And @realDonaldTrump s antics   like attacking judges & calling for his opponent s imprisonment   echo the @HouseGOP s witch hunts.

 Anti-Semitism Is Rapidly Rising And It’s All Thanks To Trump Supporters,"When Hillary Clinton called half of Trump supporters  deplorables,  she said they exhibited  racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic  views and that such views made them irredeemable   at least in the political realm. The only thing that was wrong with her statement is that she left out a key prejudice among Trump supporters   anti-Semitism.It s no secret anymore that with the rise of Donald Trump the United States has seen a rise in anti-Semitic rhetoric, particularly aimed at those in the media who write unflattering (yet unbiased) articles about Trump.According to CNN:The ADL [Anti-Defamation League] says it found 2.6 million tweets  containing language frequently found in anti-Semitic speech  between August 2015 and July 2016. 19,253 of those tweets were directed at American journalists, the ADL found; the top 10 most targeted journalists (all of whom are Jewish) received 83 percent of them.The ADL says, There is evidence that a considerable number of the anti-Semitic tweets targeting journalists originate with people identifying themselves as Trump supporters,  conservatives  or extreme right-wing elements. Thanks GOP, you ve built this! The party that is pro-Israel is now becoming the party that tells Jewish reporters to go  back to the ovens  when they report on Trump in a  negative  light.Journalists such as Politico s Hadas Gold, NYT s Jonathan Weisman, and Julia Ioffe have all faced disgusting and deplorable attacks, with Trump supporters painting ovens and Nazi-era  Juden  stars and bullet holes on their profiles.Gold, who was also profiled with a  Juden  star, told CNN:Anti-Semitism has a long history, but this election has brought about a rise in fear of the  other  and despite being a vital part of American history for hundreds of years, Jews are often still seen as the other.Weisman also spoke to CNN, and noted that it s not just Antisemitism that has up-ticked this election, but hatred all around:I am troubled by the uptick of hate in this country writ large. I would not be so bold as to say that Antisemitism on Twitter is the worst of it. I would say Muslims being beat up in the street, Hispanics being ostracized at school   those are far worse. This is just a single manifestation of growing hate and bullying in this country.And we all know whose fault that is. While Trump has been openly hostile to journalists   referring to them as  absolute scum  and saying that he hates them   he has also dog whistled antisemitism through his conspiracy riddled theories as to why he is losing. When Trump says  they  are part of a globalist, banking and media conspiracy against him, it doesn t take a genius to see who  they  pertains to. Just look back through history and browse white-supremacist websites. Whenever  they  are mentioned as holding all the power and influence, it s almost overwhelmingly referring to Jews.Hillary Clinton is right: a large chunk of Trump supporters are deplorables. They exhibit racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia and xenophobia. But now we have another notch to add to their belt: anti-Semitism.Featured image via Sean Rayford/Getty Images",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" This Traditionally Red State Is Going Blue, New Poll Shows","Remember back in May when Donald Trump said he d make California, New York and Maryland compatible (and that he d win them)? Well it s now mid-October and he can barely hang on to red states Utah, Georgia, Arizona and even Texas   the latest poll out of the Lone Star state has him leading by three points. Romney won Texas by 19 points in 2012.There is one state in particular that is leaning towards Hillary Clinton   Arizona.The Grand Canyon state, home to Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Jan Brewer, and the god-awful SB 1070, should be a dead set win for Trump, whose anti-immigration rhetoric has propelled him to where he is today. However, recent polling out of the state suggests that Clinton has the upper hand, and for good reason.According to a new Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News poll released just before the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by five points, 39-34 percent. Gary Johnson took six percent while Jill Stein took one percent. Twenty percent remain undecided.However, when pressed on how those who  lean  one way or the other would solidly vote, as of right now, both Clinton and Trump expand their lead:When including  leaners  in the sample, the number of undecideds drops to 8.1 percent. Clinton s support rises to 43.3 percent while Trump s support increases to 37.8 percent. Johnson gets 6.5 percent while Stein gets 4.3 percent. The margin of error for the sample including the leaners is plus or minus 4 percentage points.In Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight general election projection, Clinton has a 58 percent chance of winning Arizona s 11 electoral votes, compared to Trump s 42 percent chance. In the last 48 polls conducted in the state, Clinton holds the edge in 26, Trump in 19, and a tie in three.It is because of these shocking poll results that the Clinton campaign is pumping more than $2 million in advertising in the state and sending a slew of high profile surrogates   including First Lady Michelle Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders   all across the state.The last time Arizona went blue was in 1996, when voters chose Bill Clinton over Senator Bob Dole by 2 percent.Imagine if Arizona, a state most affected by illegal immigration, stuck it to Trump on election day? Arizona is proving to have a rich, culturally diverse electorate, buoyed by Latino and Hispanic voters who don t take too kindly to Trump s xenophobic, racist tones.Ana Navarro was right   if Trump thought insulting Mexicans and Hispanics was the right move, he s going to have one hell of a wake up call in November.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Stooge: Women Making Assault Claims Are Too UGLY To Be Believed (VIDEO),"One of Donald Trump s top campaign officials has once again made a gross sexist comment while defending the nominee. Appearing on CNN to discuss the large group of women who have accused Trump of unwanted sexual advances and misconduct, Trump attorney Michael Cohen told the host that the women in question  aren t even women he d be attracted to. It was disgusting.Michael Cohen says Trump was saying accusers are ""not someone he would be attracted to"" so that makes the claims ""nonsense"" pic.twitter.com/2Kn2sUuPDe  Colin Jones (@colinjones) October 18, 2016 Beauty is in the eye of beholder   these aren t even women he d be attracted to,  Cohen said of Trump in a CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday.That line follows a recurring argument Trump has been making on the campaign trail   that some of the women who accused him of groping, kissing, and manhandling them were not attractive and therefore are not telling the truth.Cohen went on to say,  I think what Mr. Trump is really trying to say is that they re not somebody that he would be attracted to, and therefore, the whole thing is nonsense. The ongoing controversy over Trump s behavior and comments have helped to damage his already failing campaign. Every serious national poll now shows Trump behind from anywhere from 4% to 12%.Nobody has ever returned from a deficit that large in the history of presidential polling, and the same average that shows Clinton now well ahead correctly foresaw the winner of the last four presidential elections.Women have been key to Trump s collapse. While a slight majority of men back Trump, Clinton s advantage with women has consistently been 11% and higher, even before the latest round of revelations.In addition to rejecting his current behavior, women responding to the pollsters have said that his dismissive attitude towards them has contributed to Clinton s support.The poll drop also comes as Trump spent days attacking former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, in what was seen as a continuation of his fat-shaming of her in the 1990s.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Paul LePage Claims Election Will Be Rigged In Maine, Gets HUMILIATED By Secretary Of State","It sounds like Paul LePage just claimed that he was elected twice via a rigged system.Because that s the only real way he can honestly declare that Maine is already in the bag for Hillary Clinton.But that s exactly what the Tea Party Maine Governor said during a phone interview with WVOM radio this week in defense of his buddy Donald Trump.The Republican nominee has been desperately trying to convince everyone that the only reason he is losing in the polls and will lose on November 8th is because the media and Hillary Clinton s campaign are rigging the election against him.And Lepage, whose own constituents in Maine are calling for him to resign, believes him. I am not confident that we are going to have a clean election in Maine,  LePage said.  Will people from the cemetery be voting? Yes, all around the country. The media and the Democratic Party want everybody to vote, whether they re citizens or not. LePage also said that he doesn t  think the elections in the state of Maine or the United States are legitimate  unless voter ID laws are in place everywhere.Those are pretty strong declarations. There s just one large problem. If Maine elections are  rigged  by Democrats, how the hell did Paul LePage win in 2010?It s a good question, and one that Maine Secretary of State Michael Dunlap posed in an email to the Bangor Daily News. Maine has a proud history of full access for voters to participate in our elections,  Dunlap wrote.  It s curious that the governor would question the integrity of a system under which he was elected twice. Indeed, not only has Paul LePage won in his state twice, he did so the first time when Democrats controlled the entire state government. Democrat John Baldacci served as governor from 2003 to 2011, including during the 2010 Election that somehow swept LePage into office. In addition, Democrat Michael Dunlap was also Secretary of State at the time. Furthermore, Democrats had control of the statehouse as they had for four decades. So really, if Democrats had been in the business of rigging elections, LePage would not be in office right now. He would have lost his race in 2010.The fact is that voter fraud is incredibly rare in this country.According to the Washington Post, a comprehensive study found that out of one billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014, only 31 cases of voter fraud were found.In other words, America does not have rigged elections. So like Trump, Paul LePage would be better off shutting his big mouth.Featured Image: Cagle",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Kathy Griffin PERFECTLY Responds To Trump’s Insults Toward Women,"The hell with parody, this should be a real campaign ad.Donald Trump has a long and sordid history when it comes to talking about women.The Republican nominee especially enjoys insulting women s looks   from calling women  pigs  to calling women who have small breasts  unattractive  to criticizing their body shape. He has even said on camera that he can t say that he treats women with respect.And all of these recorded quotes came back to bite Trump on the ass in a parody ad starring comedian Kathy Griffin.In the video, Griffin is shown applying makeup and getting dressed as Trump s voice booms out some of the nasty things he has said about women over the years. At first, Griffin merely tells Trump to  f*ck off,  but as Trump s insults get more annoying Griffin only gets angrier. Oh, f*ck off you piece of shit!  she says at one point. Then she flips him off using the double bird.At the end, Griffin apologizes to Michelle Obama for taking the low road.  Sorry, Michelle, when he goes low, I go lower. A screen then pops up asking,  Is Donald Trump the president we want for our daughters? But Griffin took one last shot at Donald before the video ended.  Seriously, f*ck off, Donald. Here s the video via YouTube.Griffin, along with millions of other women across the country, have every right to be pissed off at Donald Trump. He s a scumbag who clearly has no respect for women. He treats them like sexual objects meant to be conquered, even by force.Trump has openly bragged about groping women against their will and even had the audacity to attack the various women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual assault by saying that they are not pretty enough for him to assault.This man is incapable of respecting women and he will only treat them like shit as president. And that is unacceptable.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Completely COLLAPSING In Most Important Republican State,"The only state keeping the Republican Party viable at the national level in presidential races is the state of Texas. Texas and its 38 electoral votes help to form the backbone in any Republican quest for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.Republicans have not lost Texas since 1976, when Jimmy Carter defeated Gerald Ford after Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Whether Republicans have won or lost the overall race, Texas has been blood red (Mitt Romney won by 16% there in 2012).But now with Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, suddenly the race has seriously narrowed in Texas.Donald Trump is still winning in the deep red state, but his advantage has dropped precipitously from double digits to under 5 percent in the last two weeks. The last three polls in the state show him ahead of Hillary Clinton by only 2 points in a Washington Post-SurveyMonkey poll, 3 points in a University of Houston poll and 4 points in a Survey USA/Texas Tenga poll.All of those most recent polls were conducted after the Oct. 7 release of a tape in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women. Polls conducted in the prior month show the GOP candidate leading by at least 12 and up to 22 points. A couple of earlier polls had signaled the race might be closer than expected, but there hasn t been consistent evidence until now.A Clinton win in Texas isn t required for there to be considered a major ground-shifting development. Even a single-digit Texas loss would be a huge step forward for Democrats there, and a shock to the system for Republicans.The growing Latino population in Texas has consistently raised Democratic hopes that the state could be tipped into their column like it has been in Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico. Democrats are also hoping for success in Arizona, where incumbent Senator John McCain recently denounced Trump for his crude comments with Billy Bush.Things are changing in the southwest, and they might change faster than anyone expected.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Trump’s Newest Endorsement PROVES He’s A Racist Piece Of Crap (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is obsessed with himself. So obsessed that he covers his wall with covers of magazines and newspapers that have his face on them, because  it s cheaper than wallpaper.  Well just recently The Crusader, the KKK s official newspaper, has endorsed Trump. Do you think that ll make it up on his wall? Or does he not  know anything about them?  In the past when talk of David Duke and the KKK endorsing Trump was circulating he claimed to know nothing about them. Shouldn t someone who s the potential president of the United States know what the KKK is? You can see more on that here:So while Donald Trump claims to have know idea who the Klu Klux Klan is, there have been ties from Trump s inner circle to the KKK.

However, with Trump winning the nomination, and winning in Tennessee, this tweet seems just about right.Has Hillary Clinton done anything to deserve a  lock her up  chant? No, not at all. Anything she s been accused of by the Republican party or others has been debunked, held absolutely no water, or she s been cleared.If Republicans want to look for someone to lock up, maybe they should look at Trump and his sexually predatory behavior, inability to pay taxes, and fraudulent business practices.

 CNN Host STUNNED As Trump Supporter Says Voter Fraud Got Obama Elected (VIDEO),"As Donald Trump and his supporters continue to live in a frightening amount of denial that they are losing this election, their moronic claims of the election being  rigged  is only getting louder. Their cries have gotten more desperate as Trump s campaign continues to further unravel thanks to a leaked audio tape and numerous allegations of sexual assault against Trump.CNN s Jake Tapper recently had a mind numbing experience with a Trump supporter on The Lead, when Trump spokesperson Boris Epshteyn actually tried to say that President Barack Obama won the 2008 election because of voter fraud in North Carolina. Building upon Trump s claims of a  rigged system , Epshteyn said: What Mr. Trump and our campaign are talking about is the rigged system in two ways. One, in terms of the media. 96 percent of donations, contributions in this cycle by the media are going to the Clinton campaign. Epshteyn didn t get very far before Tapper cut him off and said: Boris, That s like from like restaurant   that s like from TV critics and restaurant reviewers. That s not from me! That s not from Chris Cuomo or campaign staff or anybody covering the election. But Epshteyn didn t care how idiotic his argument was and kept right on, spewing exaggerated numbers just like his boss: Numbers by Pew show that 40 percent of people who are not citizens are registered to vote. People who are dead voting in Colorado. Those are the kind of instances, the kind of voter fraud, we want to make sure that does not happen.Barack Obama may have won   that Barack Obama may have won in 2008 in North Carolina due to illegal voting. And this is where Epshteyn went too damn far. Guest Angela Rye, who was standing beside him, blurted out  Oh my God  in disbelief, and Tapper jumped in to dispute this insanity. Tapper fired back: Boris, where are you getting that from? Barack Obama won in North Carolina because of voter fraud? Rye laughed at the bizarre claim, but Epshteyn wasn t deterred. He continued: Look at the Washington Post story saying 5 percent of voting in North Carolina may have been by non-citizens who shouldn t have been voting and swung North Carolina to Mr. Obama   to President Obama   because of how tight the race in North Carolina was in 2008. The segment then erupted in chaos as Rye and Epshteyn sparred over Trump s recent sexual assault allegations and this ridiculous voter fraud claim. Tapper just looked on, almost too stunned to do anything.

 SIX Witnesses Corroborate Sexual Assault Claim Made By ‘People’ Writer Against Trump,"Former People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff has produced six witnesses who corroborate her allegations when she said Donald Trump was  pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat. We walked into that room alone, and Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat,  she stated.Trump recently denied the story and later attacked Stoynoff while campaigning, saying,  She lies! Look at her, I don t think so. One of the witnesses is friend who was with Stoynoff when she ran into Melania Trump later in N.Y.C.Melania Trump is demanding a retraction and apology from People magazine, a move which surprises no one ever, especially since she previously threatened to sue bloggers for quoting from a source.The newest demand letter denies that Stoynoff and Melania ran into each other on the street that day. In states, in part,  The true facts are these: Mrs. Trump did not encounter Ms. Stoynoff on the street, nor have any conversation with her. Stoynoff s friend Liza Herz remembers the encounter. They chatted in a friendly way,  Herz says.  And what struck me most was that Melania was carrying a child and wearing heels. But, according to what Melania told  Anderson Cooper, that encounter never happened, saying, in part,  I was never friends with her, I would not recognize her. Stoynoff, though, was working on a profile of Melania s husband.People magazine reports:PEOPLE Editor in Chief Jess Cagle says in a statement about Stoynoff s piece,  In this week s issue of PEOPLE (which hits newsstands in New York on Wednesday), we feature a story that includes named sources who can corroborate Natasha Stoynoff s account   including one woman (a friend of Natasha s) who was actually with her when she bumped into Melania Trump on Fifth Ave., as outlined in her story. Five other witnesses also back up Stoynoff s account of her encounter with Trump.A longtime friend of Stoynoff s, Marina Grasic, said she got a phone call from her friend the day after the attack. During that call Stoynoff detailed everything about the assault.Grasic said Stoynoff felt embarrassed and even thought of Trump s then-pregnant wife Melania when deciding not to come forward about the incident. Natasha was also struggling about not hurting pregnant Melania if the story came out,  Grasic says.  Beyond just the attack, she was horrified by the vulgar circumstances under which she was attacked and propositioned to have an affair. She was there in a professional capacity, writing an article about their happy marriage, and after the incident Trump acted like nothing happened. In Trump fashion, we can expect Donald to insult the appearance of all six witnesses.Photo by Scott Olson via Getty.",News,"October 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Instead Of Tip, ‘Christian’ Trump Supporter Leaves Waitress UNBELIEVABLY Sexist Note (IMAGE)","Donald Trump is a disease. The symptoms have always been with us. We ve always been a nation that s at least 1/3 completely bigoted a**holes, but this year, Donald Trump has given them permission to fester and spread their hate germs all over the nation.Instead of receiving a tip, a waitress in South Carolina received a note. You re right if you re thinking that never ends well. It didn t. In the note, the obvious Trump supporter told the waitress that she was a disgrace to womankind and a disgrace to her husband   because she worked.Thank you for your excellent service today   you re a good waitress.Here s your tip:The woman s place is in the home. Your place is in the home. It even says so in the Bible. You may think that you re contributing to your household by coming into work, but you re not. While you re in here  working  this is the reason your husband must see another woman on his way home from a long day at his work. Because you should be home taking care of the household duties, you may think what you are doing  working  is right, it is really essentially a disgrace to his manhood and to the American family. So instead of coming to your  job  and looking for handouts to feed your family, how s about going home and cleaning your house and cooking a hot meal for your husband and children, the way your husband and God intended, and help make America great again. Praying for families and our nation.Notice  make America great again?  Obviously, that was a reference to Donald Trump. And obviously, this person has no idea what Christianity is about.The waitress did respond that she  felt mortified, embarrassed, humiliated even. I felt hurt and a bit heartbroken.  She says she s not even married, but she does have a boyfriend who is supportive.Most waitresses don t work because they have nothing better to do. Most people don t work because they have nothing better to do. People, and waitresses are no exception, work because they need money to survive. Most families these days need two incomes, but conservatives don t want to do anything to help them. Instead, they destroy unions, drive down wages and take away benefits. I m not a religious person, but something makes me think Jesus wouldn t approve.h/t and featured image: Patheos |",News,"October 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ivanka Trump FINALLY Has Something To Say About ‘Pu**ygate’,"Everybody under the sun has had something to say about Trump s boasts of sexual assault in the bombshell  pu**ygate  tape and the avalanche of accusations against him that followed. Everyone that is, except his oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.In the Access Hollywood tapes from 2005, Trump brags that he  just starts kissing  random women if he finds them attractive and can even  grab em by the pu**y  because he is  a star.  People have come out of the woodwork to weigh in on Trump s sexually predatory boasts, but until now, Ivanka has kept her silence.On Monday, Ivanka issued a statement regarding her father s disgusting comments to Fast Company. My father s comments were clearly inappropriate and offensive, and I m glad that he acknowledged this fact with an immediate apology to my family and the American people. And that s all she has to say about that. He said he s sorry, so no harm, no foul. For the record, she said nothing in the statement about her father telling Howard Stern that it was okay to refer to her as a  piece of ass. But as short as her statement was, she did go further than her brother by calling dear old dad s remarks  offensive.  Eric Trump defended his father s comments as just being  locker room talk  and the inevitable result of two  alpha personalities  having a conversation.In a separate interview with Fast Company, Ivanka said that she is able to  shrug off  all the negative reports about her father, even the long list of women accusing Trump of sexual assault. The greatest comfort I have is the fact that I know my father. Most of the people who write about him don t. I do,  she explained.  So that gives me an ability to shrug off the things that I read about him that are wrong. You can read Ivanka s interview in its entirety, here.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: President Obama Tells Whiny Trump To Shut The F*ck Up About Election Being ‘Rigged’,"Most Americans wish that the 2016 Presidential Election were already over, but we all have to wait three more weeks, which means hearing more claims from Trump that the election is rigged against him. The Republican nominee has been making such claims since the conventions for both parties ended in July and Hillary Clinton came out with a large lead over him.He has accused the media and the Clinton campaign of colluding to fix the election in Hillary s favor and is urging his supporters to go to polling places on Election Day to intimidate voters. Trump has drilled his rhetoric about election rigging into his supporters  heads so deep that many of them are already threatening bloody violence and the assassination of Hillary Clinton if she wins.Well, President Obama has had enough of Trump s bullshit whining, and he slammed him for it during a White House news conference on Tuesday.Calling Trump s claims  irresponsible,  President Obama pointed out that Trump s whining  doesn t show the kind of leadership and toughness that you want out of a president. President Obama addressed the absurdity of Trump s claim by noting that America s election system is decentralized, which means elections are run by local and state governments, and that there are way too many votes being cast across 50 states that it s impossible to rig an election.Indeed, over 100 million Americans voted in 2012 and a comprehensive study concluded in 2014 that out of one billion votes cast since 2000, only 31 credible cases of voter fraud were found.So Trump s claim that the election is rigged has no historical evidence to suggest election rigging has occurred in the past. And President Obama declared that such claims are unprecedented I have never seen in my lifetime, or in modern political history, any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. It s unprecedented,  Obama said.  It happens to be based on no facts. Trump  started whining before the game is even over,  Obama continued.  I d advise Mr. Trump to stop whining, and go try to make his case to get votes. President Obama then took the high road by saying that if Trump wins on November 8th he will meet with him at the White House like an adult and escort him to his inauguration for a peaceful transfer of power. And that is the total opposite of what Trump and his supporters say they will do if Hillary Clinton is the winner.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy. His repeated claims that the election is rigged is making his supporters paranoid and bloodthirsty. As President Obama said, Trump must congratulate Hillary Clinton if he loses and concede defeat gracefully. Calling the results rigged and refusing to admit defeat would only hurt our democratic process and could result in violence and chaos, especially if his supporters try to overthrow the federal government.If that happens, Trump and his supporters should be arrested and charged with committing treason against the United States. Period.For now, Trump needs to stop whining and abandon his rhetoric about rigged elections. It s not helping him. He s only embarrassing himself and making himself look even more unfit to be president.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Supporter Accuses Hillary Of Sexual Assault And CNN Panel Demolishes Them,"Donald Trump s new strategy to spin away from the sexual assault avalanche that is burying him apparently includes accusing Hillary Clinton of sexual assault.Because that s exactly what Trump minion Gina Loudon did during an appearance on CNN with Don Lemon on Monday night.Loudon and fellow Trump minion Betsey McCaughey tried to steer the discussion from Trump s sexual assault comments to claims of mass election fraud, which Trump has repeatedly tried to convince everyone is a thing that actually happens even though it is incredibly rare in our country.At that point, panelist Bakari Sellers had had enough and shut both women down to return the discussion to the topic at hand. This is absurd,  Sellers said.  Bless your heart, both of you, this is patently absurd. You talked about the fact that Donald Trump somehow had allegations that were unproven. No. Melania Trump was on camera today, trying to deal with his own comments coming out of his mouth. We weren t even at the allegations. We were at the point that he said he likes to sexually abuse people. You cannot be serious,  Loudon exclaimed. But Sellers refused to back down.  That s sexual assault, is it not?  he asked.Indeed, Trump bragged about groping women against their will back in 2005 while on a hot mic while on Access Hollywood. Groping women against their will is the exact definition of sexual assault. But Loudon has a totally different definition and she openly stated it on national television when she openly accused Hillary Clinton of sexually assaulting Bill Clinton s accusers. Words are not sexual assault,  she claimed.  What is sexual assault is what Hillary Clinton did to the women her husband absolutely, factually assaulted. Wow. Donald Trump s supporters literally just sunk to a new low in their desperate effort to paint Hillary as worse than the Republican nominee.Lemon and Sellers were stunned by the ridiculous accusation and former Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter told the two women that they are embarrassing themselves.Loudon insisted that Hillary paid $100,000 to a private investigator to  dig up bad stuff on these women,  but when Lemon and Nutter told her there was no evidence of her claims, the best Loudon could offer is that there is an alleged tape and that she has heard it. In other words, hearsay, which is not evidence.Nutter went on to slam Donald Trump as a liar and he actually listed off many of the things Trump has lied about, and unlike Loudon s claim, there is evidence to back him up.Here s the video via VidMe.Donald Trump has no business being a candidate for the presidency and his supporters should not be allowed on national media programs. All they have done is lie throughout this campaign and accusing Hillary of sexual assault should be the last time Gina Loudon is ever invited back on CNN or any other news outlet.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Melania Trump Makes SHOCKING Admission Disqualifying Her Husband From Office,"Most sane people have been extremely alarmed that we have a toddler in a 70-year-old man s body at the top of a major party s presidential nominee. That person is, of course, Republican Donald J. Trump.  Trump has managed to do a million things that would have destroyed any other candidate s campaign, but still he powered on to win the GOP nomination.During this travesty of a campaign, Trump s wife Melania has largely been absent from the campaign trail. She has been visible at the debates in the family box, of course, but hasn t said a word since she was humiliated by giving a conventions speech that was plagiarized from First Lady Michelle Obama s 2008 speech at the Democratic National Convention. Now, in the wake of her husband humiliating her entire family by being caught on a hot mic having a horrifically lewd and offensive conversation about women with then-Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, Melania Trump is breaking her silence.She sat down to discuss the tape and her husband s behavior with CNN s Anderson Cooper, in which while she said the language used by both men was  unacceptable,  Melania seemed to take a  boys will be boys  angle on the whole thing, and even took the whole thing a bit further by literally calling her 70-year-old husband a kid. Here is the exchange, via The Hill: It s kinda like two teenage boys   actually they should behave better, right?  the potential first lady said about her husband and former  Access Hollywood  host Billy Bush. He was 59,  Cooper said. Correct,  Trump responded. Sometimes I said I have two boys at home   I have my young son and I have my husband,  Trump said.  I know how some men talk. That s how I saw it. Melania Trump went on to say: We talk a lot, a lot about the campaign. We talk about the language because I don t allow that he uses bad language.   But I tell him that, you know, there are consequences as well, and he   he needs to be careful [with the] language he uses. Unfortunately, I ve got news for Mrs. Trump. Her husband IS a kid, just as she alluded to herself. That alone should tell her what the rest of us already know: he should not be running for president.Watch the exchange below:Melania Trump on ""locker room talk"": ""I know how some men talk and that's how I saw it, yes"" https://t.co/IDm7N1ioh5 https://t.co/0UMZBrGmw5  CNN (@CNN) October 18, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Tries To Kiss Little Girl On The Lips And She Is NOT Thrilled About It,"Donald Trump is seriously stupid.Considering all of the sexual assault allegations against him, the fact that he wants to bang his daughter, the fact that he has hit on teen girls, and talked about dating a girl when she was just ten-years old, one would think Trump would know better than to bring a girl on stage at one of his rallies.But that s exactly what he did on Monday night when he invited the child to the podium. Trump then picked her up, told her how beautiful she is and then tried to kiss her repeatedly, including on the lips, which the girl clearly did NOT appreciate. You can see it on her face as she tries to avoid Trump s lips and then runs back to her parents.Here s the video via YouTube.The optics here are absolutely terrible. If Trump had done this a year ago this probably wouldn t be much of a story. But we are three weeks out from Election Day and Donald Trump is embroiled in a mountain of sexual assault allegations and is still experiencing fallout because of his comments about groping women and not waiting to kiss women he considers  beautiful.  Apparently, that disgusting personal policy includes little girls, too.Of course, Trump trying to kiss a little girl horrified America, and they let Trump know about it on Twitter.About the gross video of Trump trying to kiss a little girl against her will: I don t even try to hug my daughter when she s not feeling it.

" New Poll: Clinton Picks Up Unprecedented, Historical Support Among Young Voters","Several weeks ago, polls and pundits were spelling doom and gloom for Hillary Clinton. Why? Support among millennial voters   the biggest voting bloc in the country   were dwindling for the Democrat nominee, and were instead attracted to third party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.Two polls, released within days of each other, showed over a third of millennials backing a third party candidate, severely cutting into Clinton s chances of winning over the Obama coalition.But as the race comes to a close, millennials are finally seeing the big picture: do we elect and accomplished, qualified politico or a racist, sexual predator? Luckily, millennials have chosen the former over the latter.A new poll just released by USA Today   Rock The Vote, with the help of Ipsos, found that Hillary Clinton holds a 40 point lead over Donald Trump when it comes to millennial voters, 68 percent to 20 percent. Johnson nabbed 8 percent and Stein a dismal 1 percent.Almost 7 in 10 young people now support Clinton. To put that into context, President Obama won the youth vote with 66 percent support in 2008, and 67 percent in 2012. That means that Clinton is on track, just barely, to ushering in a historical and unprecedented win among young voters which would propel her to the White House.A study conducted by the Center for Research and Information on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University found that, when it came to the 2012 election, the youth vote was the decisive factor in who won. The study found that because millennial voters came out in droves to support Obama, at least 80 electoral votes were awarded, all from key swing states   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida and Virginia. Coincidentally, all those states are considered swing states in the 2016 election (with the exception of Virginia).If 68 percent of just half of the millennial population votes for Hillary Clinton on November 8, she wins, hands down, and that s not even taking into consideration her gains among white, college educated women and men (who typically vote Republican). That s also not taking into consideration her gains made with Asian-Americans and Cuban Americans.Clinton has the numbers to win. She has made gains all across the board, and Trump is under-performing Mitt Romney in crucial swing states, with typical GOP voters, and with those who typically don t vote GOP. The only thing that can hold Clinton back is Democrats not showing up to vote, especially young people.This is why this year s Get Out the Vote will be detrimental to results in the coming weeks. With early voting underway (in record numbers), Democrats have a real opportunity to start off on strong footing and cruise into the November general election.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here’s The Master List Of Reasons Why Trump Would Be The Worst President EVER (CITATIONS),"We know Trump is a sexual predator. We know he s racist. We know he welches on contracts. We know he flies off the handle at the slightest hint of an insult. We know his foreign policy will get us into war with the entire planet, and his other policy positions are as solid as fresh Jell-O; all of which could destroy us even without a war. We know he lies about pretty much everything. Yet, for inexplicable reasons, people still support him, and that s incredibly maddening.However, many people don t know what to say when a Trump supporter says,  Why shouldn t I vote for him? Hillary s the devil!  Hillary Derangement Syndrome isn t a good enough reason to vote for Trump, though, especially since there s no proof of all those accusations of crimes, whatever the right-wing  We just KNOW she s a criminal!  crowd says. Here s a long list of reasons why Trump has neither the mentality, nor the temperament, to be President.Trump denied housing to black people and lied to black applicants about apartment availability in violation of the Fair Housing Act.He stereotyped black people as welfare recipients by complaining that the government was trying to force him to rent to welfare recipients in the wake of this scandal.Casino bosses felt compelled to order black people off the floors when Donald and Ivana would visit.Trump ran smear campaigns against the Central Park Five, a group consisting of four black males and one Latino male, who were sent to prison for a brutal rape they didn t commit. He still smears them.Trump actually said,  Black guys counting my money! I hate it,  and  I think that the guy is lazy. It s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is. He wanted  The Apprentice: White People vs. Black People .He was a major player in the birther lies about President Obama, including claiming Obama was a  secret Muslim. He believes well-educated black people have advantages over well-educated white people in the jobs market.He said that Obama hadn t been very good for  the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore. He openly praised some of his supporters for beating up a Black Lives Matter protester at one of his rallies.He said black people live in poverty, with terrible schools, and then asked them what they had to lose voting for him.He called Mexicans  criminals and rapists. He denigrated Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who s presiding over one of the Trump U. cases, saying his Mexican heritage meant he was biased against Trump.He said Mexicans and other immigrants were killers and rapists.He accused Mexico of sending their bad people up to us to deal with.In response to questions about these comments, he said,  Well, somebody s doing the raping, Don! I mean somebody s doing it! Who s doing the raping? Who s doing the raping? He made a very similar comment about Muslims about 9/11:  Well, somebody s blowing us up. Somebody s blowing up buildings, and somebody s doing lots of bad stuff. He said  I love Hispanics!  in a tweet of himself eating from a taco bowl in Trump Tower (this is like eating a watermelon or fried chicken and saying,  I love black people! ).He called supporters who beat up a homeless Hispanic man  passionate. He lied about Native Americans having a well-documented history of criminal activity to stop them from building a casino that would compete with his casinos in Atlantic City.He told the House Native American Affairs Subcomittee that the Mashantucket Pequot Nation, a Native American community in Connecticut near where he wanted to open a casino  don t look like Indians to me. They don t look like Indians to Indians. He s repeatedly called Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has Cherokee ancestry,  Pocahontas. He s told Jews that he s a negotiator, just like them, and doubled down on that stereotype that Jews control the world s business dealings by saying,  Is there anyone who doesn t renegotiate deals in this room? He said Jews weren t going to support him because he doesn t want their money. They re going to want  their own politician. He wanted to rent apartments only to  Jews and executives. He tweeted an anti-Semitic picture of Hillary Clinton.He wants to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S., and force the Muslims already living here to register and wear some kind of ID.He said there s no choice but to close down mosques in the U.S.When attacking the Khans the Gold Star family who lost their son in Iraq and blasted him from the stage of the DNC he mocked both Khizr and his wife, Ghazala, for their culture by saying,  If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn t allowed to have anything to say. You tell me. He will not condemn the white nationalists/supremacists that make up the core of his base, and claims not to know who some of them, like David Duke, are. He wants to punish women who get abortions.He d shut down the U.S. government if it would help get Planned Parenthood defunded.He believes sexual assault in the military is the inevitable result of putting men and women together.He believes pregnancy is an inconvenience to business.He believes that women who are sexually harassed at work should find another career. He even says his own daughter should do that.He bragged about sexually assaulting and harassing women with Billy Bush on a bus for  Access Hollywood. The women who won on  The Apprentice  did so largely on their sex appeal.He openly talked about the size of his female contestants  breasts and which ones he d like to have sex with, and wanted women he worked with on the show to wear shorter skirts and bare more cleavage.He asked the men on  The Apprentice  to rate the women there on their physical attributes.He s told women they wouldn t have their jobs if they weren t beautiful, and fired women for losing their looks.He painted women who won t sign pre-nups as calculating gold-diggers, and accused women in general of being nothing more than manipulators of men in his book, The Art of the Comeback.He believes women enable their husbands  philandering (so Melania does, too, we suppose).He admitted to ogling Hillary Clinton during the 2nd general election debate, saying he  wasn t impressed. He loves lines in movies that demean women, such as,  Bitch, be quiet,  from  Pulp Fiction. He s  joked  that if Ivanka wasn t his daughter, he d be dating her.He s talked about Ivanka as a  piece of ass. He told two 14-year old girls that he d be dating them in a couple of years.He said something similar about a 10-year old girl.He wasn t afraid to say that a 12-year old Paris Hilton was hot.He thinks walking into a dressing room full of undressed, underage girls is perfectly okay.He said that an 18-year old Lindsay Lohan  is deeply troubled and therefore probably great in bed. How come the deeply troubled women, you know, deeply, deeply troubled, they re always the best in bed? He got into a months-long feud with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly because she dared to ask him about his sexism in the 1st GOP primary debate.He s stalked and harassed other female reporters who were negative about him.He said,  Women, you have to treat  em like shit. He pitched a show he wanted to call  Lady or a Tramp?  It was to be a reality show about out-of-control party girls, and whether they could be turned into  ladies. He called a breastfeeding mother  disgusting  because she needed a break from a court deposition to pump her breasts.He has a history of calling women  ugly,   slobs,   pigs,   dogs,   bimbos,   Miss Piggy,  and other misogynistic terms.He keeps claiming that polls show that he won the first two debates in landslides (the credible polls show nothing of the sort)He claimed he never told people to check out Alicia Machado s sex tape (he literally said  check out [her] sex tape )He says Hillary has no childcare plan (it s been available for months)He said that Obama and Hillary are the founders of ISIS (no, not even close)He claimed to have sent investigators to Hawaii to investigate Obama s birth certificate, and said that they couldn t believe what they were finding (har de har har)He said that the NFL sent him a letter complaining about the debate schedule (the NFL stated they did no such thing)He claimed that Ted Cruz s father was seen with Lee Harvey Oswald when President John. F. Kennedy was shot (nobody has been able to corroborate this)He blasted the 2016 omnibus spending bill as funding a flood of undocumented immigrants (it strengthened border security)He ran an ad claiming to show Mexicans streaming across our border (the footage of people streaming across a border was actually from Morocco)He claimed thousands of Arabs in New Jersey were cheering in the streets as the Twin Towers fell (he s the only one who ever saw this)He keeps saying he can t release his tax returns because of an audit (the IRS says otherwise)He said he has a fiduciary duty to his businesses and his family to pay as little tax as possible (no such fiduciary duty exists since these are personal returns, not corporate returns)He claims it was Hillary who started the birther conspiracy (she didn t, here s who did)He says he never supported the war in Iraq (he said on Howard Stern s show that he supported it)He believes Tim Kaine oversaw a huge increase in undocumented immigration as governor of Virginia (such immigration was flat under Kaine)He claimed Hillary would print instant work permits for undocumented immigrants (they wouldn t be instant, and such permits would go to foreign graduate students already here legally)He claims NATO created a new terrorism division because of him (he had nothing to do with it)He said he saw a  top secret video  of Iranian officials offloading $400 million from an American plane (no such tape ever existed)He says Hillary filibustered away legislation that would have reformed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the bill never even faced a cloture vote)He s said we ve got no system to vet refugees (we have an extensive system to vet them)He said that the wives and families of the 9/11 hijackers were sent back to Saudi Arabia two days before the attacks for safety (total baloney)He claimed that Trump University had an A rating from the Better Business Bureau (not really; it did once, but its final rating was a D-)He accused Ted Cruz of having a double passport (there s no such thing as a double passport, and Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014)He said that Syrian Christians can t come into the U.S. (we have no religious test for refugees)He sued the Department of Justice for defamation after they sued him for violating the Fair Housing ActHe has threatened multiple outlets, including with lawsuits and even sent cease-and-desist letters, for making him look bad. Such outlets include:He threatened to sue Louisiana delegates for standing by Ted Cruz during the primaries.He also threatened to sue Ted Cruz over alleged voter fraud in Iowa after losing the primary there.He threatened to sue Cruz over a negative political ad.He wanted to sue Bill Maher after Maher bet $5 million for Trump to prove he  wasn t the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan. He tried to sue reporter Timothy O Brien for questioning his wealth in a 2005 biography called  TrumpNation. One of his advisors said,  Every critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump. He vowed to get revenge on Republicans who turned their backs on him following the revelations that he s a sexual predator.He threatened to start a super-Pac in 2018 for the sole purpose of taking down both Ted Cruz and John Kasich for perceived slights during and after the primaries.He believes that his poll numbers are falling apart because of an international conspiracy involving Hillary, Democrats, banks, and the media, rather than because of anything he s done.He believes Hillary has corrupted the FBI so they would absolve her of wrongdoing in her email scandal.He believes that immigration officials are allowing undocumented immigrants into the country specifically to vote for Hillary.He thinks that Hillary conspired with the debate organizers to hold the first two debates on NFL game days, in an effort to ensure fewer people saw him on the debate stages.He believes that the entire election is rigged because Hillary isn t in prison, and has repeatedly threatened to jail her after he s elected.There s a strong possibility that his entire circus of a campaign is his revenge on a political class that s been laughing at him for 30 years.He repeatedly and viciously attacked a Gold Star family who angered him from the stage of the DNC.He said he wanted to hit other DNC speakers  so hard, their heads will spin. He wants to  open up libel laws  after he s elected for the sole purpose of suing the press for saying bad things about him.The most well known scam is probably Trump University, in which students paid ever growing amounts to learn secrets that didn t exist from instructors that Trump didn t even know, despite his claims.He has funneled millions from his campaign to his own businesses, legally, but with clear intent to line his own pockets with campaign funds.He used Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to insulate himself from the fallout of his failed business ventures. He claims he was  just playing the game. He tried to force tenants on Central Park South out of their rent-controlled apartments so he could knock the building down and build expensive luxury condos.He used undocumented Polish immigrants to help build his signature Trump Tower, in New York. Part of the purpose of this was to avoid paying union pensions and other compensation.He had his father swoop in on one of his troubled Atlantic City casinos and buy $3.5 million worth of chips instead of getting a bank loan, which was a violation of New Jersey gaming laws.When he dabbled in the  condo-hotel  business, condo buyers often purchased from him because of his allegedly good name, and a belief that they d deal directly with him, only to find that he was barely involved.He has refused to pay his contractors, along with workers such as plumbers and even dishwashers, in his buildings. His excuses are along the lines of bad workmanship, but other employees admitted in court that some managers determined painters had already been paid enough, so he refused to pay any more.He bought up tons of his own books to drive their sales up.His non-profit organization, the Trump Foundation, can t legally solicit donations because it never filed the requisite paperwork through the State of New York. Records show that the foundation didn t always make the donations it claimed. It s also implicated in some of the donations to states  attorneys general that were initiating investigations into him.His businesses have had business in Cuba, in one way or another, for at least the last 20 years, in violation of the embargo. He claims this isn t true.How anybody can vote for Trump, knowing all of this, is beyond the realm of sanity. Trump is an evil, disgusting liar of a piece of dirty pond scum. He has no business being anywhere near the White House.

 Howard Stern: Having Trump On My Show To Demean Women With Sex Talk Was No Accident,"Time and time again, Donald Trump appeared on the Howard Stern Show. During his interviews, he rated women on a scale from one to ten, told Stern it was okay to call his daughter Ivanka a  piece of ass,  and bragged about his own sex life. (I ll wait while you gag.) These comments have come back to bite Trump in his orange derriere repeatedly throughout his run for the White House.Howard Stern, who happens to be a Democrat, is finally commenting on the impact his past shows have had on this year s election. He said that having the billionaire on his show to talk about sex and degrade women was no accident, Trump fit the part by nature. Stern also said that he was not replaying the tapes of the GOP nominee s old interviews because he considers Trump a friend and doing so would be a  betrayal. Donald Trump did the show in an effort to be entertaining and have fun with us,  Stern said on his Sirius satellite radio show.  I fully knew what I was doing when I interviewed Trump. I knew I had a guy who loved to talk about sex.   I had a guy who loved to evaluate women on a scale of 1 to 10. These are avenues I went down because I knew it would entertain the audience. Stern said that he was stunned that the tapes from his show hadn t surfaced earlier. He added that he had asked Trump what the heck he was thinking when he launched his bid for the presidency. I said,  Why are you doing this? Why would a guy with billions of dollars (run for president)?   Don t you know what they re gonna do to you? Don t you know they re gonna open up everything?' The shock jock also weighed in on the  Pu**ygate  tapes that recently turned up in which Trump bragged that he could sexually assault women because he is  a star.  Stern is known for his raunchiness, but even he said that Trump s locker room talk  defense was a load of crap. I have never been in the room when someone has said,  Grab them by the pussy,'  said Stern.  No one s ever advocated going that step where you get a little bit,  Hey I m going to invade someone s space.'

 REPORT: Trump Laughed After Woman Was Grabbed ‘By The P*ssy’ On Apprentice Set,"Donald Trump is again under fire from allegations of misbehavior on the topic of sexual conduct on the set of his reality show, The Apprentice. Trump has increasingly been criticized for his actions with women, as they have come forward one-by-one making claims that the Republican presidential nominee forced himself on them.The latest claim, uncovered by The Daily Beast, involves Trump s failure to act.Oscar nominee Gary Busey allegedly sexually assaulted a female Apprentice employee during his time on the show, five Apprentice employees tell The Daily Beast. Donald Trump knew about the incident, laughed it off, and kept Busey on his TV series, these staffers said.Multiple Apprentice employees, including the alleged victim herself, told The Daily Beast that the Academy-Award-nominated actor  grabbed  one of their colleagues  firmly between [the] legs  during the 2011 season of Celebrity Apprentice. Busey also forcibly put the female staffer s hand on the crotch of his pants. The alleged incident, which they say took place during a location shoot in SoHo in New York City, prompted a firestorm among members of the Apprentice crew.The report comes as the Trump campaign has begun a public relations offensive featuring Trump s current wife, Melania. She appeared on several outlets and claimed that the women coming forward to accuse her husband were all lying. Melania Trump also claimed that the audio tape in which Trump joked about sexually assaulting women was simply a matter of the 59-year-old Trump acting like a  boy  and being egged on by Access Hollywood host Billy Bush.Newly released polls show that a majority of woman voters do not take such a charitable view of Trump s actions, and instead are overwhelmingly choosing Hillary Clinton as their candidate. Clinton is even winning a plurality of support with married women, previously a weak spot for Democratic candidates.Featured image via YouTube",News,"October 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Expert On Voting Fraud DESTROYS Trump’s Lies In BLISTERING Twitter Attack (TWEETS),"Terrified and unable to accept that he s destroyed almost all chances of winning this election, Republican nominee Donald Trump is STILL whining that everything is rigged   from claims of media bias, sabotaged debate microphones, dishonest polls, and voter fraud. Trump isn t letting it go, and even his own party isn t willing to support him on his ridiculous claims anymore. Earlier Monday, Trump tweeted: Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive! Well, someone came forward to put Trump s lies to rest once and for all. Election law expert Rick Hasen finally had enough of Trump s idiocy and issued some brutal fact-checking on Twitter. Hasen was the perfect person to come forward and annihilate Trump   he s spent his career studying voter fraud, and was more than qualified to drop this brilliant truth bomb on unsuspecting Trump. In an epic Tweetstorm, Hasen ripped Trump a new one and proved that Trump s fear mongering about voter fraud has been taken way out of proportion and is a blatant exaggeration:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterAnd these are only a FEW of the tweets of Hasen slamming Trump. You can see the full sh*tshow here. Hasen didn t stop with a social media rant, either   he wroteHasen didn t stop with a social media rant, either   he wrote a scathing op-ed on Talking Points Memo: Claims of voter fraud are often exaggerated by orders of magnitude. Consider the claims about non-citizen voting. Matt Drudge recently had a headline stating:  Report: 1,000+ Illegal Voters in Virginia.  And Dan Scavino, Jr. tweeted:  Terrible. We know who the 1,000+ illegal aliens ARE NOT VOTING FOR! A fixed presidential election in the making .will we ever know!?!?  But if you look at the underlying report, they have identified only 31 actual non-citizen voters in Virginia over the last 10 years. No doubt there are some more, as not all the counties have responded yet. But it is not 1,000 plus non-citizens voting in Va. ( In the 8 jurisdictions that provided us with lists of aliens recently removed from their voter rolls, we discovered that 31 non-citizens had cast a total of 186 votes between 2005 and 2015. The most alien votes were cast in 2012 followed by 2008, the year President Obama was elected to his first term.  (emphasis omitted)). Don t believe all the hype. Non-citizen voting is a real, but pretty small, problem (because the penalties are high and the payoff low). Unfortunately, we know Trump isn t going to shut up because he only gets louder after being proven wrong. Thank goodness we only have to tolerate a few more weeks of him.Featured image via Jeff Swensen / Getty Images",News,"October 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Wolf Blitzer SILENCES Trump Supporter’s Whining About No Equal Air Time For Clinton Accusers,"Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway ran into a buzzsaw named Wolf Blitzer on Monday and she was absolutely shredded with facts.The CNN host grilled Conway for being a hypocrite when it comes to women who are accusing Republican nominee Donald Trump of sexual assault versus the women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault twenty years ago. Why do you believe that voters should believe Bill Clinton s accusers, there are several of them, but not Donald Trump s accusers?  Blitzer asked during The Situation Room after pointing out a tweet by Conway saying that she agrees with Hillary Clinton that  every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard. Conway responded by basically walking back her tweet and then started ranting about evidence and that belief should only apply if the women take Trump to court. Of course, the statute of limitations pretty much prevents any meaningful judgment from coming down. Meanwhile, Bill Clinton s accusers did not file their own claims in court until after they went public in the media. Juanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of raping her, even filed a sworn affidavit claiming that the rape allegations were not true, thus contradicting her own retraction later on.Conway also tried to change the subject, but Wolf didn t let her off the hook, and that led to Conway whining about how little air time Bill Clinton s accusers supposedly received at the time they made their accusations. These woman got nearly no air time compared to the air time that was given on CNN and other places, Wolf, to the accusers of Donald Trump,  she complained.  It s simply unfair and unbalanced. It s also a complete fabrication. You see, Wolf Blitzer was a Senior White House Correspondent at the time so he remembers the media circus surrounding the accusations against Clinton and he brutally reminded Conway of that fact and the fact that she should know better since she was there as well. Let me just point out, I was CNN s Senior White House Correspondent in 1998, 1999, 2000, when these women, including of course Monica Lewinsky, got tons and tons and tons of air time. You remember those days, I remember those days. We all remember those days, we went through all of those cases, these women who have come forward. We gave them a lot of reporting time. When Blitzer continued by asking Conway if she would encourage Trump s supporters to go to court, she quickly denied doing that. You know, because Trump would be forced to go to court as well.Conway proceeded to argue that Hillary s conduct toward the women is relevant but then turned around and cheered on Melania Trump for calling her husband s accusers liars and accusing them of  fabricating  these allegations for  financial and political reasons. In other words, Conway is okay with Melania Trump believing her husband and treating these women like moneygrubbers and liars, but she thinks Hillary Clinton is evil for doing the same thing back in the 1990s?That s some professional hypocrisy Conway is practicing.Here s the video:The bottom line here is that Bill Clinton is not running for president. Donald Trump IS.Hillary Clinton was First Lady twenty years ago. And she acted as any wife would in defense of her husband. But again, Hillary Clinton has never been accused of sexual assault. Trump IS being accused of sexual assault. But Trump and his team are pretending that Hillary Clinton s conduct toward her husband s accusers is worse than Trump s conduct toward women and that is a false equivalency that should be blown to smithereens the same way Wolf Blitzer torpedoed Kellyanne Conway s whining about equal air time.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Pro-Trump ‘Christian’ Leaders Just Got Taken To The Woodshed By 700 Christian Women,"Conservative  Christian  leaders who still support Donald Trump despite his sexism and remarks about sexual assault are feeling the wrath of Christian women right now.When Donald Trump was caught bragging about groping women, hitting on teen girls, and accused of sexual assault, conservative  Christians  like Tony Perkins, Ralph Reed, and Pat Robertson all said that they continue to support the Republican nominee, thus proving that they care more about power than they do about morals.Indeed, the hypocrisy of conservative  Christian  leaders, when it comes to Trump, has been stunning to watch unfold because these men are literally giving Trump a pass. If Trump had sexually assaulted men instead of women, you can be sure Perkins and the rest of his ilk would not only be calling for Trump to be removed from the ballot, they d be calling for his execution.But because Trump assaulted and insulted women, these so-called  men of God  don t give a damn.And they pissed women off in the process, which is why 700 Christian women from across the country signed a letter to these male leaders calling them out for continuing to support Trump. As Christian women we are appalled by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s recorded remarks that disparage women and condone sexual assault,  the women wrote.  Such language cannot be dismissed as  locker room talk. Mr. Trump must offer public contrition that fully acknowledges the seriousness and depravity of his actions.The sin of misogyny has caused many of us to experience sexual assault or sexually abusive language that threatened our safety, dignity and well-being.Christian leaders cannot condone such violent speech about women as a minor mistake or an innocent attempt to be  macho.  These excuses teach our young people that such language is acceptable and do further harm to those who have been abused.We urge all religious leaders to preach, teach and help their communities heal from the twin sins of sexual violence and misogyny. While we are disheartened by Mr. Trump s toxic words, we believe this moment presents an opportunity to teach our daughters and sons that they are loved, and to teach all Americans how to speak out against sexually violent language.Unlike the charlatans who still support Trump and dare to call themselves  Christians,  these 700 women are demonstrating true Christian values.Donald Trump s words and behavior is unacceptable and should be condemned by religious leaders, not ignored or excused. Ignoring and excusing his behavior and words only sends a message to men within and outside of the congregation that it is okay to treat women like shit. But it s not okay and Donald Trump should not be allowed to be President of the United States.Any conservative  Christian  who still supports Trump after these latest revelations even after whining for years about how America supposedly needs a president with strong moral values in the White House, should be ashamed of themselves because they not only revealed themselves as hypocrites, they disgraced their church and their God.Featured Image: Dashboard Jesus via Amazon",News,"October 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama Teams Up With Stephen Colbert For Brutal Trump Diss; Trump LIVID (VIDEO),"President Barack Obama hasn t exactly kept his disgust and disdain for Republican nominee Donald Trump a secret, but he made it hilariously obvious when he appeared on Monday night s Late Show With Stephen Colbert, as the two men brutally mocked the GOP s sorry excuse for a presidential candidate.On the show, Obama sat down with host Stephen Colbert, who tries to disguise himself so he can subtly ask the President how he feels about this election s presidential candidates. Because he couldn t flat-out ask Obama how he really felt, Colbert found an interesting way to get the information out of our commander-in-chief: by asking him to choose between two snacks.Colbert asked Obama to make a decision between  an extra fiber nutrient bar which has traveled to more than 100 countries, or this shriveled tangerine covered in golden retriever hair, filled with bile, that I wouldn t leave alone with the woman I love.  By the description alone, we all know just which snack represented what candidate but the visual made the whole thing even more hilarious. In all honesty, the tangerine wasn t too far off from being an exact replica of Trump anyway.You can watch the clip below to see Colbert and Obama both poke fun of America s worse presidential candidate to date:Wherein @POTUS makes an important snack decision. (Watch the rest tonight on #LSSC!) pic.twitter.com/Wkeqs6tMU8  The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) October 17, 2016Judging by Trump s Twitter activity over the last few hours, the business mogul may have already seen this clip   because he was caught dissing Obama shortly after Colbert tweeted the clip (and Obama s decision):TwitterBitter, much? Trump s emotions are running high right now, and he must be terrified to face off with Clinton again during Wednesday night s debate. He s unraveling fast, and I m sure having the President of the United States insult you only adds insult to injury.Featured image via screenshots",News,"October 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BOMBSHELL: Melania Trump Refuses To Believe Access Hollywood Tapes In BIZARRE Interview (VIDEO),"With the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood tape revealing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump saying lewd remarks that revealed him to be a sexual predator, there hasn t been anyone capable of defending him.However, now, in an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, Melania Trump is coming to her husband s defense and seemingly blaming Billy Bush, the other man on the Access Hollywood tape.According to Melania, Bush  egged  Trump on. Although, if you listen to the tapes it was clearly the other way around.Melania told Cooper: I said to my husband that, you know, the language was inappropriate. It s not acceptable. And I was surprised, because that is not the man that I know. She also said, now making excuses for his horrific behavior: And as you can see from the tape, the cameras were not on   it was only a mic. And I wonder if they even knew that the mic was on. Then when asked if she s ever heard her husband speak like that, she said: No. No, that s why I was surprised, because I said like I don t know that person that would talk that way, and that he would say that kind of stuff in private. Melania seems to either be in complete denial that her husband does, in fact, speak that way, or she s been instructed by her husband and his campaign to shift blame to Billy Bush and away from Donald. Either way, it s very, very bizarre.In a statement after the tapes were released, Melania had said: The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me. But now she s making excuses for them. Who knows what the hell is going on, really? Yet, what we do know is that Donald Trump said those horrific remarks and needs to be kept as far away from the Oval Office as possible.Watch the video here:Melania thinks Billy  egged on  Trump into saying  dirty and bad stuff,  like these two are school boys at recess. https://t.co/fCL9SgXhP3 pic.twitter.com/UfnTQrSMad  Andrew Kirell (@AndrewKirell) October 17, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" In STUNNING Admission, John McCain Just Handed Democrats The Senate (AUDIO)","If Republicans want to lose Congress, there s one surefire way: let Americans know that they will be in for at least two more years of gridlock and obstruction if they win. John McCain, in a stunning admission, promised exactly that.In a radio interview on Philadelphia s 1210 WPHT radio on Monday, McCain wasn t able to say with certainty that Donald Trump would be better at nominating Supreme Court justices than Hillary Clinton would be, but he does promise that if Clinton wins, there s no way the Senate will ever vote on one of her Supreme Court nominees.Later in the interview, McCain used the opportunity to make the case for fellow Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who is locked in a close battle to retain his Senate seat in Pennsylvania. McCain promised that Republicans would be  united against any Supreme Court nominee  put forth by Clinton. I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up,  McCain said.  I promise you. This is where we need the majority and Pat Toomey is probably as articulate and effective on the floor of the Senate as anyone I have encountered. Source: CNNHere s the audio:Voters won t buy it. While McCain s seat is pretty safe, the Senate as a whole is not. Republicans have to win at least 21 seats to retain their majority in the Senate. Democrats only need 15. It s not just that, either. Voters know that it s Congress, not President Obama, who is responsible for the gridlock in Washington, and they are sick of it. Most Americans want the Senate to give Obama s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a hearing and ultimately, an up or down vote. Instead, McCain and Republicans are promising more of the same, which is absolutely nothing. Trust me, Americans will punish them at the polls, especially as Donald Trump s campaign continues its downward spiral.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"October 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Letter To The Editor Claims Hillary Is Unfit Because She Might Get Her Period (IMAGE),"A Pennsylvania man apparently failed basic biology, but he s a strong Donald Trump supporter. Carl Unger of Montgomery Pennsylvania wrote a letter to the Williamsport Sun-Gazette. The letter was supportive of Trump, but in protesting being called sexist, he makes one of the most sexist, and stupid attacks on Hillary Clinton yet. Now the liberals and Obama are calling for social justice and it is just code for socialism,  the letter begins. Now they have college students who are talking about being triggered and taking away freedom of speech while the liberal politicians work on taking our guns so we cannot defend ourselves when the government comes.  I hate to break it to you, Carl, but the government is everywhere. The government is the military, it s the police. If they wanted your guns, they would take them. They don t want them. They call us sexist just because we are critical of Hillary Clinton and her health.  Critical of her health? Do you expect her to apologize for the apparent federal offense of getting pneumonia?Read this next sentence/paragraph twice.Gee, Carl, we totally believe you aren t sexist, especially after that zinger. Women get sick and have their time of the month all the friggen time. Most of us still go about our business, because we have no other choice. As for Clinton, though, um, she s 68 years old. She probably hasn t had her time of the month since the last millennia. The last time, she likely lived in the White House. If she is still getting her period, well, we should be in complete awe.In case Carl s sexist argument for why he s not sexist hasn t convinced you, he also made a racist argument for why he s not racist. The liberals call us racist to silence us because they cannot handle the truth that when they give out money to people of all races it makes them lazy.

 The White House Just MOCKED Trump’s ‘Drug Test’ Request; Says He’s The One On Drugs (VIDEO),"One of Donald Trump s latest conspiracy theories he s been spreading far and wide about his opponent Hillary Clinton is that she s on drugs and there should be a drug test before the next debate.Of course, he s likely saying this, because as per usual, anything said about him he turns around to say about Hillary. He s a master projector and this  drug test  poppycock is no different. He s been sniffing constantly through the debates, and many have asked if he may be on cocaine or something else.When White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was just asked about a potential drug test, he said: You re telling me that the candidate who snorted his way through the first two debates is accusing the other candidate of taking drugs? That s a curious development in the campaign. Watch for yourself here:.@PressSec on Trump's call for candidate drug test: Trump ""snorted his way through the first two debates "" https://t.co/pcmFmEUlDY  POLITICO (@politico) October 17, 2016Of course, when pressed if he was insinuated Trump was on drugs, Earnest said he was joking.However, one does wonder why Trump keeps sniffing. Is he sick? Does he lack stamina? Is he taking drugs to stay awake? Who s really to know, but since Trump did raise the question of drug tests, maybe we should find out. Maybe he s saying it to deflect because everyone has been questioning him.See, two can play at this conspiracy theory game.How about we stick to the issues? Or the fact that Trump is still deflecting from his lack of showing his taxes. You know someone has something to hide when they can t answer questions and choose to make lame claims about their opponent.Good on Earnest for laughing it off, as we all should.Featured image via video screen capture   Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Democrats Raise Money To Rebuild Firebombed GOP Office While Selfish Trump Demonizes Them,"As Donald Trump condemned Democrats as  animals  on Sunday because a GOP office was firebombed on Saturday night, it was the Democrats who raised money to help rebuild the office while Trump didn t send a dime.Let s make one thing clear. Whoever firebombed the GOP office in Hillsborough, North Carolina is a terrorist. But we don t actually know who committed the act and we certainly don t know where the perpetrator(s) stand politically.But that didn t stop Trump from immediately blaming Hillary Clinton supporters in his response to the incident.Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016Of course, Hillary s response sounded way more presidential.The attack on the Orange County HQ @NCGOP office is horrific and unacceptable. Very grateful that everyone is safe.  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 16, 2016And while Donald Trump is busy demonizing Hillary supporters and Democrats, it is Democrats who are saving the day in the name of democracy and compassion.A group of Democrats started a GoFundMe account to raise money in an effort to help the Republican Party rebuild the destroyed office and get it running again as soon as possible. As Democrats, we are starting this campaign to enable the Orange County, North Carolina Republican office to re-open as soon as possible,  the account s message reads. Until an investigation is undertaken, we cannot know who did this or why. No matter the result, this is not how Americans resolve their differences. We talk, we argue, sometimes we march, and most of all we vote. We do not resort to violence by individuals or by mobs.So, let s all pitch in, no matter what your party affiliation, in and get that office open again quickly. And while Trump hasn t provided any money to help rebuild the office, these Democrats raised $13,000 in a matter of hours to give to the North Carolina GOP in a spectacular demonstration of American values. This is a moment for graciousness, not fractiousness,  said Jeff Jarvis, one of the Democrats who helped put this fundraiser together.Unlike Donald Trump s selfishness and accusatory rhetoric, Democrats displayed true patriotism and compassion for their fellow Americans even though they are divided by political beliefs. This is the true definition of citizenship and you have to wonder if Republicans would do the same if it were a Democratic office that had been bombed. Surely, they would. But it s hard to say considering Trump is painting Democrats as  animals  who hate America.Featured Image: Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",News,"October 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 T-shirts Were Sold Outside Bills Game With Rifle Sight On Kaepernick (IMAGES),"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick again took to his knee during the national anthem in Sunday s game against the Buffalo Bills, but before that, a loud chant of  USA, USA  could be heard at the stadium from those offended by his right to silently protest against racial inequality.The chants weren t even the worst thing on display. Just outside of the stadium, t-shirts were being sold with an image of Kaepernick with a rifle sight on him. The text on the t-shirt reads,  Wanted  and  Notorious Disgrace to America. Another t-shirt reads,  Shut Up And Stand Up!  along with the quarterback s last name spelled  Kaeperdick  and an image of him.Robert Klempko of MMQB tweeted,  Shirts with a rifle scope trained on Colin Kaepernick selling for $10 outside of Ralph Wilson stadium.  It gets even worse:Elsewhere outside the stadium, one group of fans were hitting a dummy wearing a Kaepernick jersey and an afro wig. Per Klemko, one fan, yelled,  Tackle the Muslim.

Robert Klemko (@RobertKlemko) October 16, 2016While conservatives consider Kaepernick s continued protest over racial inequality and oppression in the United States to be unpatriotic, they probably also think descending on Washington D.C. with t-shirts describing America s first black president as a scary black Kenyan is patriotic. I don t understand what s un-American about fighting for liberty and justice for everybody, for the equality this country says it stands for,  Kaepernick said after the game.  To me, I see it as very patriotic and American to uphold the United States to the standards that it says it lives by. But Kaepernick was not alone.

 WATCH: Elizabeth Warren MOCKED Trump So Hard He’ll Be Throwing A Temper Tantrum Any Second Now,"Elizabeth Warren went on the attack against Donald Trump again on Sunday and you can bet that the Republican nominee is fuming about it.During a rally in Colorado, the Massachusetts Senator called out the alleged billionaire for bragging about sexual assault, being a failed businessman, and for being too scared to release his tax returns. In this election, I am proud to be a Democrat,  Warren began.  I am proud that we are a party that doesn t debate who has the smallest hands. Warren talked about the years between 1935 and 1980 when the economy worked for all Americans before Ronald Reagan became president and helped Republicans push through an agenda that reversed that prosperity and gave it to the wealthy.Then she turned her ire back on to Trump, calling him a  small insecure moneygrubber  who only cares about himself because when the housing crash happened he rooted for it because he wanted to  swoop in  like a vulture and buy the properties on the cheap.Warren then took aim at Trump for stiffing the people he made contracts with to build his resorts, people like plumbers and painters who didn t get paid because Trump is  a pathetic cheapskate  who screws over the little guy when it suits him.Then she brought up Trump s refusal to release his tax returns, which could confirm that he paid no federal income taxes for 20 years.  The big brave Donald Trump is too chicken to release his tax returns,  she said before clucking like a chicken daring Trump to not be a coward.But she saved most of her anger for the way Trump has treated women and how he has bragged about sexually assaulting women. Some people say it makes them sick to hear Donald Trump talk like that,  Warren told the crowd.  Well not me. Donald Trump s words don t make me sick anymore. They make me furious. Here s the full speech via YouTube.Donald Trump has never been able to pick a fight with Elizabeth Warren and win so it would be inadvisable for him to attack her on social media again. But because Trump is so thin-skinned, we should be expecting a temper tantrum any time.Featured Image via screencap",News,"October 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Joe Biden Just SKEWERED Donald Trump For Bragging About Sexual Assault (VIDEO),"Vice President Joe Biden has been a strong advocate for sexual assault victims and he is letting it be known exactly where he stands when it comes to Donald Trump bragging about being a sexual predator.During the interview on Meet The Press, Biden told NBC s Chuck Todd that when Trump boasted that he could  grab  em by the p*ssy,  the GOP nominee was giving a textbook definition of sexual assault.  Todd asked the vice president why Trump didn t deserve to get the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the sexual assault allegations against him that have been piling up. Biden s answer was simple:  His own words. His own words, I don t even have to go to the accusers,  Biden explained.  When a man says what he said, that is a textbook definition of sexual assault. I mean, it s a textbook definition. But what makes it believable that he engaged in that kind of activity, it s not that just that he said it, but sort of his instinctive abuse of power. He acts like that in private sector and he acts in the way he treats employees,  he continued.  You know,  I live in the penthouse. I m a billionaire, I m a star and I can do what I want.  That s the most disturbing piece! You know, my father used to say,  The greatest abuse is the abuse of power.  Economic power, political power, physical power. And this is not a guy who should be representing the United States in anyway.

" Trump Amps Up Feud With Paul Ryan, Kicks GOP Civil War Into High Gear (TWEETS)","There is most definitely no love lost between GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan. This is especially true since Trump was caught on tape with then- Access Hollywood host Billy Bush having an extremely lewd conversation about women and bragging about sexual assault. Ryan uninvited Trump from their joint campaign event the next day. Trump has since been publicly attacking Ryan on Twitter, and he continued that trend Sunday.Here are the tweets Trump sent out, while the spineless speaker did nothing to control his own nominee:The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton. We have Paul Ryan, always fighting the Republican nominee!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016Even while attacking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump couldn t leave Ryan out of it:Wow, interview released by Wikileakes shows ""quid pro quo"" in Crooked Hillary e-mail probe.Such a dishonest person   & Paul Ryan does zilch!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016If Trump s previous public feuds and personal grievances are any indication, his obsession with Paul Ryan will not be ending anytime soon. In fact, it will likely go right up to election day, and Trump will blame his loss on Ryan, along with the media, the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, the women making accusations against him, and everyone but himself. Buckle your seat belt for this one Speaker Ryan. You re definitely in for a rough ride.Featured image via Sarah Rice/Getty Images",News,"October 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WOW: Republican NYT Columnist QUITS GOP, Rips Trump To Pieces In Must-Read Rant","A Republican New York Times writer just jumped ship from the GOP to become a Democrat because of Republican cowardice to unendorse Donald Trump.Josh Barro, who is also the senior editor at Business Insider, penned a column explaining why he switched parties and he did not hold back. The most important thing we have learned this year is that, when the Republican Party was hijacked by a dangerous fascist who threatens to destroy the institutions that make America great and free, most Republicans up and down the organizational chart stood behind him and insisted he ought to be president,  Barro began before focusing on Republicans who support Trump despite how dangerous he is to our country.Specifically, he called out Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and House Speaker Paul Ryan for standing by Trump anyway  for reasons of strategy, careerism, or cowardice. Referring to them as  cowards and scoundrels,  Barro points to these three as the primary reason he has left the party he grew up supporting. They are taking an action that risks the destruction of the American republic to advance their personal interests,  Barro wrote.  I can only conclude from the available evidence that they love their careers more than they love America. And they are why I quit the Republican Party this week. Barro explained that he has been a Republican for a long time because he didn t  think it was ridiculous to be in a party that I disagreed with on a lot of national issues. He had hoped to help bring change to the Republican Party from within, to  improve ideas at the margin in the long run.  But what this election has made clear is that policy is not the most important problem with the Republican Party,  Barro said.Indeed, Republicans are only really interested in power, which is why Republican leaders have thrown in their lot with Trump. They are hoping Trump will be a puppet who will pass all of their agenda, which would basically burn the government to the ground and usher in a completely ideologically pure conservative government.Barro went on to describe the  fundamental vulnerability  of the GOP.Because of the fact-free environment so many of its voters live in, and because of the anti-Democrat hysteria that had been willfully whipped up by so many of its politicians, it was possible for the party to be taken over by a fascist promising revenge.And because there are only two major parties in the United States, and either of the parties  nominees can become president, such a vulnerability in the Republican Party constitutes a vulnerability in our democracy. I can t be a part of an organization that creates that kind of risk,  Barro said.Considering part of the Republican agenda includes voter suppression and stripping civil rights away from women and minorities, Barro is spot on with his observation.He has also concluded that while moderate Republicans may try to wrestle the soul of the party back from the  conspiracy nuts and proto-fascists  that have taken it over, he believe they  will fail  and he refuses to  stick around to watch. Barro is definitely not alone. Many Republicans have been jumping ship because of Donald Trump. And on Election Day, we will find out just exactly how much the Republican Party has been damaged by this exodus. Because if Trump loses by a landslide and down-ticket GOP candidates get their asses handed to them, it will be such a disaster for the party that they will have no choice. They will have to change or go extinct.Featured Image: baystateconservativenews.com",News,"October 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Tim Kaine BURNS Unhinged Trump: He’s ‘Swinging At Every Phantom Of His Own Imagination’,"Donald Trump has been coming apart at the seams before our very eyes. The public has noticed, certainly, but so has someone else: Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine. Hillary Clinton s veep said the following of Trump s attempts to blame the rest of the world for the accusations of groping that keep coming out against him: He is swinging at every phantom of his own imagination because he knows he s losing. These remarks were made on ABC s This Week, and Kaine also made it crystal clear that Trump s allegations that Hillary s campaign had anything to do with the avalanche of unflattering stories that have come out ever since Trump was caught on a hot mic with then-Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, insisting that he could do anything he wanted to women because he is a star.While discussing Trump, Kaine also reminded America of the orange buffoon s bullying behavior, and said that the hot mic tape is what gave these women the courage to tell the stories of their experience with Trump: That s what s going on. It s not because of our campaign, but it s very characteristic of Donald Trump that now he s blaming these women.He s making weird claims that, no, I couldn t have assaulted this person, she s not attractive enough to assault. How bizarre is that? He s blaming the media; he s blaming the GOP; he s saying that America can t run a fair election. And this is what bullies do. Tim Kaine is right. Trump bullies and threatens anyone who he can t get his way with. He makes sure that people understand that he ll make their lives a living hell if they dare to go against him, no matter how horrible his behavior has been.Well, it looks like Trump has finally met his match, and the tantrum he throws when he loses on election night is sure to be one for the ages.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republican Mailer Threatens To Out Voters To Neighbors If They Vote Democrat,"New Mexico Republicans are resorting to intimidation tactics to scare voters into voting for Donald Trump.The Republican Party is literally sending out flyers to people across the state warning them that if they don t vote GOP on Election Day they will tattle on them to their neighbors and make life more difficult for them.According to the Daily Beast,The mailer shows a woman in a cold blue hue peeking through her blinds.  When the Democrats win the election and you didn t do your part  your neighbors will know,  it reads, in all caps.The back shows a map of houses, some tagged with red check marks in blue pinpoints. Do your part in this election,  it says.  After all, voting is a matter of public record. While whether you voted or not is a matter of public record, who or what party you voted for is not. Obtaining and using such information to threaten voters is election fraud and voter intimidation, both of which are federal crimes.18 U.S, Code 594 states,Whoever intimidates, threatens, coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose  shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.And a spokesman for the New Mexico GOP admitted that the party sent out the flyer, thus admitting to committing a crime. But when further questioned about the flyer, W. Tucker Keene hung up on the The Daily Beast.While Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters continue to cry about election fraud, their own party is committing that very crime in New Mexico. The question is do they have a problem with that or do they only care about non-existent election fraud that Democrats are supposedly going to commit?Because not having a problem with real election fraud just because it is perpetrated by Republicans would make them hypocrites.By outing people who vote Democrat, the New Mexico GOP would be putting Americans in danger of being persecuted or worse just because they voted a certain way.Sending out a mailer with the intent to intimidate voters is illegal and the New Mexico GOP should be under investigation by the Department of Justice. This is an outrageous dirty tactic and there needs to be serious consequences.Featured Image: Daily Beast ",News,"October 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Arizona Newspaper Just Gave Trump Fans A Lesson In Patriotism That Will Leave Them FUMING,"Trumpkins fancy themselves true American patriots, despite their lord and savior, Donald Trump, being the opposite of American patriotism. They re so secure in their not-patriotism that they threaten anyone who doesn t want to vote for Trump with violence, and death.Those anti-American threats have extended to newspapers like the Arizona Republic, which endorsed Hillary at the end of September. That endorsement represents the first time in the paper s 125-year history that they ve endorsed a Democrat.They started receiving death threats shortly after the first debate. Today, the paper s president put Trumpkins to shame by telling them what real patriotism looks like, and it looks nothing like Donald Trump. Free speech requires compassion.  The woman who answered the phone at the Republic s offices got to hear an angry caller wish doom on them, and invoke the name of one of the paper s reporters who was assassinated 40 years ago. She reported that caller to the authorities, but she also prayed for the caller, despite the threat. Free speech requires an open debate.  Nicole, the paper s editor in charge of the news staff, led her reporters to a Trump rally following their endorsement, knowing the jeers and harassment they would receive. Trumpkins had said the Republic would burn, should be shut down, etc., and still she did her job in covering both sides of the election. Free speech requires bravery.  Trumpkins also said that anyone with whom they disagree should be punished. The Republic s editorial page editor, Phil, who s a lifelong Republican, calmly denounced Trump, over and over, despite the escalating problems with Trump s fans. Free speech is part of a society that values hard work and opportunity.  This one should be obvious because Trump s fans allegedly value hard work above all. The young men and women who sell Republic subscriptions door-to-door were so frightened after getting spit on, bullied, and threatened with violence that they didn t want the paper to publish their first names. Yet, they still come to work and still go door-to-door. Free speech is sometimes the only way to hold the powerful accountable.  Trump fans called the paper s staff  hacks  and  losers.  It was an investigative reporter at the Republic who first broke the story about the horrid treatment veterans receive at the Phoenix VA. His work brought that out into the open, led to uncovering more scandals, and now, maybe real change can happen. Do Trump fans value vets? Not nearly enough. Do they know how to research? No. Free speech, and a free press, comes at a cost.  Trumpkins told the paper that one of their legacy publishers, Gene Pulliam, was spinning in his grave over their terrible transgression in endorsing a Democrat. Gene s wife, Nina, sat at the bedside of the reporter who was assassinated 40 years ago, and watched him die slowly for the crime of doing his job. Freedom of religion is a fragile and precious thing.  The Republic s current president, Mi-Ai Parrish, has a grandfather who is a Christian pastor. Trump fans who have deluded themselves into thinking they re Christian said Jesus would judge her, that she would burn in hell and that non-Christians should be kept out. She invoked her grandfather, who is an example of real Christian persecution. He and a friend were imprisoned and tortured for refusing to deny Christ.One of the biggest insults to Christians who suffer such persecution in the world is all the pseudo-Christians here who are crying about persecution because they can t force their religion down our throats. These people are sorry excuses for Christians on those grounds alone.The paper was also asked what right they had to endorse Hillary. Parrish has family that grew up under an oppressive dictator. Her mother had no right to free speech, no right to free press, no right to education, and no right to vote. The Trump fans would take all of that away from us just so they re more comfortable. One man can make a difference.  At its core, that is what America stands for. Jobe Couch, an Army cultural attach  living in Alabama, sponsored Parrish s aunts and mother when they came over from Korea. His generosity helped many immigrants, who are now citizens and earning their livings as teachers, engineers, pastors, lawyers, and more. The Trump fans who told the Republic s staff that they should go live with those immigrants they love so much, in the countries they come from, have forgotten what America is.What s the First Amendment all about? It s all about the above. Trumpkins have no clue what patriotism is   if they did, they d be appalled at anyone who behaved the way they and Trump himself do.To read the Arizona Republic s entire moving response, click here.Featured image by Zeb Micelli, Public Domain, via Wikimedia Commons",News,"October 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Jake Tapper FLATTENS Trump Supporter For Citing Child Pimp As Witness Against Groping Claims,"Using a pimp for pedophiles as a witness is something only a sleazy and desperate lawyer would do.But former NYC mayor and Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani did it anyway during an appearance on CNN to defend Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault and Jake Tapper was quick to burn him for it.From the start, it was clear that Giuliani is a hypocrite because while he absolutely believes the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, he refuses to believe the women who have come forward to say the the Republican nominee sexually assaulted them. So far, nine women made such claims about Trump. But Giuliani thinks they are all liars. Do you believe every one of these women is lying?  Tapper asked. No, I believe my friend Donald Trump when he tells me he didn t do it,  Giuliani replied.  I ve never seen him do anything like that. Well, of course you haven t, Rudy. You ve only been kissing Trump s ass since April. Trump has been groping women for decades as a private citizen.Giuliani then conceded that he hasn t investigated the women s claims but he attacked Jessica Leeds in particularly by bringing up an alleged witness to the alleged groping on an airplane in the 1980s. There is an independent witness who says it s not true,  Giuliani declared triumphantly.But a disgusted Tapper crushed Giuliani s attempt to defend Trump by pointing out that Anthony Gilberthorpe was a self-claimed pimp for pedophiles who delivered underage boys to British politicians, hardly a credible witness and certainly not the kind of witness an attorney worth their salt would want on the stand.Tapper then cornered Giuliani about his support of the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, noting that Donald Trump has paraded these women around and continues to talk about sexual assault even as his surrogates complain that the media hasn t moved on to covering something else.Hypocritically, instead of answering Tapper, Giuliani did just that and complained about the media and insisted that they move on from focusing on the sexual assault allegations against Trump. In fact, Giuliani was so desperate to stop talking about the sexual assault allegations that he rambled on and on for the remainder of the interview about other stuff Trump has talked about.Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump should have to answer for these allegations all the way through Election Day and so should his supporters. These are serious accusations that have a lot of credibility considering Trump has openly bragged about groping women whenever he wants even if they don t want him to do so.And Trump has only made things more difficult for himself by bringing in Bill Clinton s accusers and trash talking the women who have come forward against him.Republicans have also made this more of a story by continuing to support Trump despite his comments and behavior.So really, the only one Giuliani should blame for the media circus surrounding Trump is Trump himself.But again, that would require Giuliani taking his lips off of Trump s ass first.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump FURIOUS After New Poll DEVASTATES His Campaign,"NBC News third post-leaked audio, post-second debate poll shows something quite shocking (but not really): Hillary Clinton is gaining an insurmountable lead over Donald Trump, with just three weeks left to go until election day.The new poll, conducted October 10 through the 13th, with 1,000 respondents, shows Clinton with an 11-point lead, 48 to 37 percent over Trump. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, has seven percent in support and Green Party candidate Jill Stein has 2 percent.In a head-to-head matchup, Clinton maintains a 10 point lead, 51-41, with 10 percent undecided.As NBC News put it:To put Clinton s current 11-point lead into perspective, Barack Obama beat John McCain by seven points nationally in 2008. And Obama s margin of victory over Mitt Romney in 2012 was four points.Both pollsters who coordinated with NBC News, Democrat Fred Yang and Republican Bill McInturff, both came to the conclusion that Trump does not have a chance of winning the presidency.One of the biggest contributing factors to Clinton s lead in her 20 point advantage with women (55-35 percent), her 60 point advantage with non-white voters (76-16 percent), and her gain among men in which she s behind by just three points, 48-45 percent.The poll als0 shows President Obama s approval rating at 53 percent, a positive for Clinton heading into the final stretch of the election.Now that the polls have shown a consistent lead for Clinton, Trump has no other way to legitimize his failing, pathetic campaign than to claim it s going to be  rigged  against them thanks to minority communities, dead people, a globalist conspiracy.Now that InfoWars has overtaken his campaign, the public has been turned off and are showing that they are ready for Hillary.Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton an 86 percent chance of winning the election and Trump a 14 percent chance. This marks the 10th day that Clinton has been in the high 80s, the same place she was at after the Democratic National Convention.Trump has a lot of ground came to catch up on. Can he do it in three weeks? Who knows, but it s not looking good for him.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Alec Baldwin Didn’t Even Wait For Trump To Whine About SNL Before Smacking Him Around (VIDEO),"Alec Baldwin didn t even wait to taste Trump s salty yet delicious tears after his brilliant Saturday Night Live smackdown of the 2016 nominee. Baldwin perfectly captured the disaster that was Trump s performance during the second presidential debate, but the true magic happened on Twitter   no, we re not talking about the actor nonchalantly retweeting Trump s tantrum. We re talking about how he perfectly anticipated the meltdown and left a response before the show was even filmed.After the show aired, The Donald had a full-blown meltdown on Twitter (because where else?)   one Baldwin retweeted to make sure the world saw what a mess Trump is.While the world recognized how badass this was   Baldwin essentially firing a rocket launcher at Trump s stupid plane and walking away without so much as looking at the explosion   what many are missing is that he didn t even need to say a word. He already did that on Friday in anticipation of the 2016 GOP nominee s oh-so-predictable meltdown. Before Trump said a word, Baldwin had a response prepared:  Fuck your feelings.  He even used a photo of one of The Donald s  deplorables  to do it.It s disheartening that the GOP can t field someone who won t be baited into a full-blown tantrum by someone making a few jokes about him. But this is where we re at. Be sure to vote BLUE on November 8 (not November 28 as Trump told his  Deplorables  at a rally recently). This is probably the first time we ve had the literal life or death of our nation riding on an election.Featured image via Getty Images/Paul Hawthorn",News,"October 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 PATHETIC: Saturday Night Live Jokes Make Donald Trump Throw A HUGE Temper Tantrum,"Donald Trump has seen Saturday Night Live s cold open portrayal of him and it caused him to throw a hissy fit like a toddler.Alec Baldwin once again turned in a brilliant and hilarious performance as the Republican nominee during the second debate and it was so goo that Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize the actor and whine about the sketch. Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me,  Trump wrote before calling for the show to end and accusing the media of rigging the election against him.  Time to retire the boring and unfunny show.

An hour after that tweet he continued bitching about the media and complained about his poll numbers among women in an all caps meltdown repeatedly accusing them of rigging the election.Polls close, but can you believe I lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED. Media rigging election!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016Then he accused the media and the Clinton campaign of working together to rig the election.Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016It s so easy to make thin-skinned Donald Trump lose his sh*t that it only took a couple minute sketch on SNL to do it.That means Trump could easily be provoked by leaders of other nations, only he would have access to the military and nuclear weapons as president, not just Twitter.Clearly, Trump does not have the temperament necessary to be a world leader.And his continued claims that the election is being rigged is dangerous because his supporters are now seriously threatening bloody rebellion and even the assassination of Hillary Clinton if she beats him on Election Day.

 Trump’s #1 Deplorable Has A Question For You Libtards (VIDEO),"Jim Stachowiak is a staunch Trump supporter who is just sick and tired of it all (though he probably couldn t name an actual problem the United States has) and wants to take his country back and make it great again just like The Donald says. Sure, Stachowiak (like his Fuhrer) hasn t traditionally bothered with facts, or the truth, or even so much as a rational thought   but he has been a foot soldier in the 2016 GOP nominee s war on decency for quite some time.Stachowiak regularly posts Facebook videos with him sharing his dumbass ideas with the world   like that we can  fight Islam  by killing  n*ggers,   patriots  like himself should assassinate Obama, and shooting black kids  in the backs  would somehow solve crime.Stachowiak has long been inviting mockery   long before he famously tried to organize an anti-Muslim rally to which no one showed up. Now he s inviting you to mock the living hell out of him by asking your opinion of his stupid anti-Obama shirt.Standing on the Bobby Jones Expressway in Georgia (not in traffic, though that might have made this video more entertaining), this Second Amendment-loving  deplorable  asked one simple question of his viewers: How do you like the shirt, people? Normally, Stachowiak is the star of the show, the dumbest deplorable in the basket. But his cameraman decided to steal his crown this time. A few minutes into their whatever this was, Mr. Cameraman yells:Rights are United States citizens  law. The government is wrong right now. In this day and age we need the man who will make it all better for us. The law and all his people in America. We re fighting for the cause. Everybody bring out their big gun, cause we bring them home boys.Anybody know that the f*ck he s saying? He continues:You think if you re a minority you gonna have rights when everything hits the fan and everybody gets to go to camps? No   the only ones that s gonna have rights is those that has something, has money, to make that they gum lick to bein  on the other side of that big ol  gate.Seriously? Anyone? Everyone s gonna see when that time comes,  Dipshit adds ominously (you know, if he knew what that word meant). You think Islam is just over there on the other side of the word, no   they are here,  he says, apparently having just learned that Islam is a religion and therefore a worldwide thing. Once the Muslims take over, Camera Guy says,  they re gonna chain us up in 10-foot-wall camps and slowly cut our heads off. We oppose all enemies both foreign and domestic,  Stachowiak says.

 Did Mike Pence Use The Police To Illegally Suppress The Vote Of Tens Of Thousands Of Black People In Indiana?,"Right in the middle of the nine thousand scandals swirling around Donald Trump comes one about his running mate, Mike Pence. As governor of Indiana, Pence oversaw everything from legalized discrimination to destroying the state s educational system, and there was even an attempt to destroy freedom of the press. Now, it s come out that he may have engaged in some voter suppression as well   particularly against Indiana s black voters.This is so much worse than the clearly fraudulent voter ID law. The Indiana State Police raided the offices of the Indiana Voter Registration Project (IVRP) in an alleged attempt to root out  voter fraud . IVRP didn t see it that way, and neither did advocacy groups. They saw it as a deliberate attempt to shut them down, slowing registration and nullifying thousands of registration applications for black people across the state. The whole  initiative,  if it can even be called that, started in nine counties, and then expanded to 56 counties shortly after this raid.The IVRP is based in Indianapolis, which has a higher black population than the rest of the state. Patriot Group USA, a progressive advocacy group, started running ads against Pence and the state after the raid. They and the IVRP say that more than 40,000 black Hoosiers may not be allowed to vote on Nov. 8.Besides that, employees were barred from filming the raid, and the police handcuffed a black employee and denied him his legal right to speak to an attorney.Black voters tend to vote Democratic, and almost every voter suppression tactics are aimed at harming Democratic voting. As longtime GOP consultant Carter Wrenn said, when he effectively threw his party and its suppression tactics to the wolves: Look, if African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican, they would have kept early voting right where it was. He was speaking of North Carolina trying to end early voting, but this applies to most voter suppression tactics. Pence would know that   he s a conniving old white man who sees the black community as an electoral threat. If they can t register, they can t vote, and if they can t vote, his party is safer.It s so disgustingly simple it makes us want to put our fists through the walls.Of course, Pence s spokesperson called the allegations  false and absurd.  He said: In fact, the Indiana State Police has uncovered strong evidence of voter fraud by Patriot Majority USA. Among Governor Pence s top priorities is ensuring the integrity of the election and that every single Hoosier vote counts. He has full confidence in the Indiana State Police investigation to achieve this goal. Uh huh. Sure. The state police have found exactly ten irregularities so far, and they re mostly missing zip codes or other minor problems, according to Fusion. Ten, and those irregularities show anything but fraud.Pence ought to be ashamed of himself, but he s still Donald Trump s running mate so we all know he s incapable of shame.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"October 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" When You See A Trump Supporter Calling The Election ‘Rigged,’ This Is The PERFECT Reply","When you see a Trump supporter parroting his blatantly false talking point about the electoral process being  rigged,  just send them to istheelectionrigged.com.Recent polls have been disappointing for Trump and his followers, to say the least. In response they ve began to accuse the election of being rigged, but where is there proof? Because we have plenty of facts that say otherwise.The electoral process in America is thorough, to say the least. Thorough enough to earn the United States an 11/12 score on the electoral process from Freedom House, an independent, nonprofit organization that rates democratic institutions. You can find their reasoning through the link above.Voter fraud, for example, is virtually nonexistent. In 2014, a study showed that out of a billion ballots casted since 2000, there s only been 31 cases of voter fraud. So where s this fraud Trump is talking about? Oh, wait, it s just another one of his lies.The right-wing really screwed us over when they chose Trump as their candidate. He s brought nothing good to our country, ever. Donald Trump is a child, and what do children do when they don t get their way? They whine, saying it s unfair or try to blame it on someone else. There is no fraud going on in our election, Donald is just running out of excuses. He s a liar, just saying what people want to hear. His supporters are the type of people to follow blindly, never actually doing the research themselves   otherwise they wouldn t be his supporters. This is slightly worrisome, especially with recent talk of taking up arms against the corruption. Trump s rhetoric is undermining faith in United States democracy, with absolutely no evidence of fraud or wrongdoing. He s taking advantage of low information voters and, through his own narcissism and grand stupidity, may cause violence to break out when he inevitably loses (make sure to vote!).There s no proof of fraud or  rigging  in our electoral process, and there s been plenty to disprove it. Unfortunately, it s incredibly doubtful that this news will stop Trump and his supporters from angrily blaming the system for Trump s failure.",News,"October 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Supporters Threaten Bloody Rebellion And Assassination If They Lose On Election Day (DETAILS),"President Obama should put the National Guard and other military units on standby on Election Day.Because if Trump supporters don t get the results they want, they are going to try to kill Hillary Clinton and anyone else standing in the way of their party taking over the government.The Boston Globe attended a Donald Trump rally in Ohio last week and talked to several suppporters of the Republican nominee about what they will do if their candidate loses.To them, however, the only way Trump can lose is if their is election fraud, which Trump has already accused Hillary Clinton of committing.In Pennsylvania in August, Trump declared that the only way he can lose is if Hillary Clinton cheats, thus setting the stage for massive complaints of election fraud if Hillary wins the election on November 8th, even by a landslide.Trump has made his crowd of middle-aged white supporters very angry and very paranoid.Scott Webb is taking his command from Trump to watch polling places very seriously. Trump said to watch your precincts,  the 61-year-old said.  I m going to go, for sure. I ll look for well, it s called racial profiling. Mexicans. Syrians. People who can t speak American. I m going to go right up behind them. I ll do everything legally. I want to see if they are accountable. I m not going to do anything illegal. I m going to make them a little bit nervous. In other words, Webb is going to try to intimidate anyone who doesn t have the same skin color as he does because Trump supporters believe that only minorities commit voter fraud.65-year-old Jeannine Bell Smith is already predicting unprecedented amounts of voter fraud this election even though it is very rare in this country. We re going to have a lot of election fraud,  she said.  They are having illegals vote. In some states, you don t need voter registration to vote. We can t have that lying bitch in the White House. Judy Wright doesn t care if Hillary wins in a squeaker or by a landslide.  If Hillary wins, it s rigged,  she said.  All I know is our country is not going to be a country anymore. I ve heard people talk about a revolution. I ve heard people talk about separation of states. I don t even like to think about it. But I don t think this movement is going away. We don t have a voice anymore, and Donald Trump is giving us a voice. Indeed, many Trump supporters are ready to overthrow the government and assassinate Hillary Clinton if Trump doesn t win. That s what 50-year-old Dan Bowman told the Boston Globe in the scariest quote they obtained. If she s in office, I hope we can start a coup. She should be in prison or shot. That s how I feel about it. We re going to have a revolution and take them out of office if that s what it takes. There s going to be a lot of bloodshed. But that s what it s going to take I would do whatever I can for my country. Donald Trump and his supporter are the most dangerous threat against America and our democracy. Trump has already called for  Second Amendment people  to do something about Hillary Clinton if she wins and nominates Supreme Court Justices that conservatives don t approve of. He has also called for her to be imprisoned.And his fanatical supporters are starting to foam at the mouth at the thought to attempting to violently overthrow the government.Even Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin has called for a bloody revolt if Trump doesn t win.Trump supporters claim they are oppressed, but that s just because they aren t allowed to oppress black people, gays, and Muslims. They literally think they are being oppressed because they can t legally oppress others.The fact is that if any Trump supporters who attempt a coup will be guilty of treason and should pay major consequences for their actions. That being said, the federal government and law enforcement need to take these threats seriously. We cannot not tolerate such an attack on our democracy and the peaceful transition of power that has existed in this country since its founding. So no matter how many votes Trump loses by, even if it comes down to a few thousand, Trump s supporters need to accept that they lost fair and square.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here’s The New Way Trump Is Scamming Republican Donors Who Give The GOP Money,"Donald Trump has claimed to be a billionaire who was willing to spend major dollars in order to secure the White House and remain independent. In reality, Trump has been stingy with his money and the evidence has mounted that he is worth far less than he claims   and he won t release his tax returns to prove otherwise.Now in the most recent filings, Trump again has been shown up as a liar, donating far less of his own money to the campaign even as Hillary Clinton began to increase her lead in nearly every national poll.Donald Trump cut his routine $2 million monthly check to his campaign last September after repeatedly suggesting that he would increase his donations during the campaign s stretch run.Trump s campaign, along with Republican joint fundraising committees, said it raised $100 million last month, more than it has in any previous month though well short of the $154 million Hillary Clinton s operation took in.The report also showed that unlike in other years, big pocketed Republican donors have not lined up to support the Trump campaign. In all likelihood they are seeing the writing on the wall and are staying away from a campaign circling the drain.Since freaking out over former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, the release of his sexual assault audio tape, and the stream of women now coming forward to allege that Trump molested them, his polling numbers have collapsed. Combined with Republican officials rescinding their support, Trump is now seen as with only about a 10 percent chance of winning the election according to most polling analysis.At the same time, Hillary Clinton has consolidated most of the Democratic Party base behind her, and has top-tier surrogates like President Obama, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders campaigning on her behalf.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Woman And Her Sign Show Us Everything You Need To Know About Trump’s Black Support (IMAGE),"Donald Trump, while pretending to reach out to minorities, has almost no minority support. That doesn t stop him from talking down to African-Americans and telling them that they live in conditions of dangerous squalor that only he can fix. Of course, that doesn t stop Trump from bragging about his  great relationship with the blacks. Well, perhaps the two people holding up the  Blacks for Trump  signs at an October 12th rally had the last name of Black, because they certainly didn t look African-American.Most noticed only the woman, and Twitter tore her and the fake black outreach of the Trump campaign apart.Note the blond woman with the  Blacks for Trump  sign.

It s simply that the woman (and the man who for some reason is ignored) is the perfect symbol of Trump s African-American outreach. Trump is a white man who tells African-Americans how they should be feeling, while at the same time, having a deep history of racism.

 Democracy Expert Tells Us EXACTLY How Republicans Screwed America By Accepting Trump,"We ve heard all kinds of reasons why people shouldn t vote for Trump, and why they shouldn t even have accepted Trump to begin with. Trump really should never have gotten this far in the election process, but his lack of sound policy, his racist, xenophobic hyper-nationalism and his misogyny are actually only part of the reason. The rest of the reason lies squarely on the skin that s as thick as a single layer of gauze.Voters  confidence in the democratic system is always shaken when their candidate loses, according to democracy expert Shaun Bowler. This is true even when the elections are known to be fair. Bowler says: Collectively, the responses show that when voters see their candidate lose, their regard for the system of government as a whole takes a hit. Even within an established democracy and after an election that was not especially controversial, we see weakening legitimacy of the system in the eyes of losers. Trump has made his thinking very clear: If he wins, the election was fair. If he loses, it was rigged from the start. He will undoubtedly shout that repeatedly at the end of Election Night instead of give a measured concession speech designed to reassure his supporters that democracy still works, and they ll still be in good hands. He ll do it every day afterwards until people stop listening, too.Trump is a very sore loser. He was a sore loser in the primaries, and now, with his entire campaign falling apart, he s spinning wild conspiracies about how everything happening is specifically designed to take him down.The problem lies in the unrest that could easily follow such a declaration after the votes are counted. His supporters are all in solid agreement with him that the polls are rigged, the press is bought and paid for, and the entire planet (except Russia, of course) has been set up to put the woman they call  Crooked Hillary  into office. We ve already seen people, like this sheriff, call for armed revolt if Trump loses, because of that paranoia.We ve seen other Trump supporters say that as well. In fact, Mike Pence (who would understand this much better than Trump or his average supporter, despite being evil in his own right) had to shut down a Trumpkin in L.A. who was calling for armed revolution: Our lives depend on this election. Our kids  futures depend on this election and I will tell you just for me, and I don t want this to happen but I will tell you for me personally if Hillary Clinton gets in, I myself, I m ready for a revolution because we can t have her in. Pence s reply was a quick,  Don t say that.  However, he still encouraged people to volunteer as poll watchers to be sure that no fraud happens.Three white men, who turned out to be Trump supporters, were arrested for planning to blow up a mosque and an apartment complex full of Somali refugees the day after Election Day.Other supporters are saying they re going to menace anyone who doesn t appear to be American at the polls: I ll look for . . . well, it s called racial profiling. Mexicans. Syrians. People who can t speak American. I m going to go right up behind them. I ll do everything legally. I want to see if they are accountable. I m not going to do anything illegal. I m going to make them a little bit nervous. There s no reason to believe that this stuff won t happen, because Trump is fueling it, rather than trying to quell it. In his story, Bowler points out what actually has happened in other countries where the people believed their elections were rigged: Remember, the lowered levels of regard for the system [in 2012] occurred in an election in which no candidate was crying foul. Crying foul widens the gap in opinions, undermining the support for and legitimacy of the system as a whole.We have seen this in recent elections in Mexico, Ukraine, and Georgia. The consequence has been popular unrest and disturbances. One could argue that several of those elections were, in fact,  dirty,  and so people were right to protest at an election being stolen. (Genuine corruption is another demonstrable way to undermine faith in democracy.) But problems come when the election was clean and yet the losing politician refuses to accept the result was arrived at fairly.  [emphasis mine]There s virtually no evidence that any of our elections have ever been rigged, with the possible exception of a few local elections through history. It s easier for these paranoid lunatics to believe in a vast conspiracy, though, than it is for them to face the truth that their candidate could easily lose in a fair election. The unrest that would follow, due to Trump s fueling such conspiracy nonsense, could be devastating for us. They will not accept evidence that doesn t support their point   it ll be part of  the conspiracy. Even the GOP is afraid of what Trump s  it s rigged! Rigged, I tell you!  rhetoric can do. Lindsey Graham said: I don t think leading candidates for the presidency should undercut the process unless you have a really good reason. Former Senator Kit Bondi, of Missouri, said something similar: Someone claiming in the election,  I was defrauded,  isn t going to cut it  They re going to have to say how, where, why, when. Trump won t, though. He ll just say he knows, because Hillary s crimes and Democratic enabling and corruption are well documented, and will expect that to be sufficient.Now Republicans are crying about mounting evidence that their candidate isn t just rude, crude, vile, and impossibly thick, but is also a sexual predator. They made their bed. If we end up with Trump in the White House, what he unleashes on the world will be on their heads. If we end up with civil unrest because of Trump s sour grapes after losing, it s likewise squarely on their heads.It ll be interesting to see how they try and wriggle out of responsibility for this.Featured image by Sarah Rice via Getty Images",News,"October 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Once Threatened ‘Apprentice’ Contenstant He’d Show His ‘Power Tool’ To Her (VIDEO),"After it was revealed in the leaked Access Hollywood tape that Donald Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women, many of these women have started to come forward.These stories are piling up every day, and of course, Trump is denying every single one. Even going so far as to call these women too ugly to sexually assault.Now, a former contestant of Trump s show  The Apprentice  is speaking out on MSNBC with yet another story of Trump s lewd behavior. She recalls hearing a story from another female contestant while they were both sequestered in housing after being  fired  from the show.Apparently, during an episode that featured the home repair store Home Depot, Trump told this contestant,  I ll show you my 9-inch power tool,  clearly insinuating that he wanted to show her his penis. A statement that seems to line up with several of the stories we ve been hearing lately.This threat of being forced into sexual behavior with Trump seems to be something that happened quite regularly if you were so unfortunate to be working around the Republican candidate.While this story is not confirmed, it s fitting with the profile we ve been hearing of late about Trump, even from his own story he shared on the Access Hollywood tape.He simply cannot be allowed anywhere near the White House.Watch the Apprentice contestant reveal that information here: I ll show you my 9-inch power tool.  Former Apprentice contestant was told Trump said this during a Home Depot task. @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow pic.twitter.com/SGNr75WC1o  John Aravosis (@aravosis) October 15, 2016Featured Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images",News,"October 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Neil deGrasse Tyson And J.K. Rowling BURN Trump With Searing Joke On Twitter (TWEETS),"There is no getting away from Donald Trump, and he can t get away from his impossibly offensive attitude toward women. He s a sexual predator that has no problem asking men on  The Apprentice  to rate women based on their physical attributes, and talked freely about their breast size and whether he d consider sleeping with them. That doesn t even touch his being proud of sexually assaulting women.Aside from that, this election cycle has brought out a certain type of antagonism and uncertainty about both candidates, particularly over their leadership styles and abilities. Neil deGrasse Tyson sort of spoke to that when he asked the following question:If a Space Alien landed in the USA & requested:  Take me to your leader , I wonder how Pres Trump would react vs Pres Clinton  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 14, 2016He probably didn t expect J.K. Rowling, the famous author of the Harry Potter series, to respond at all, let alone with the following burn:Afraid we need to know whether the alien has breasts before we can answer. https://t.co/xHE9K5F7xt  J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) October 14, 2016We don t care who you are, that s funny right there. Why? Because it s not only one of the biggest torches one can take to the catastrophe that is The Donald, but also because it keeps the fact that he s a danger to women and girls in the spotlight in a very mocking way.And, as we all know here, mocking King Cheeto is the only real way to deal with him on the internet.As another sign of how dangerous he is for women, he s busy calling all the women who ve accused him of sexual assault of being liars and seeking fame. He also asked one of his crowds why women aren t coming forward about President Obama, since obviously, if they ll lie for the sole purpose of smearing him, they should also be willing to lie to smear people he hates. In fact, they probably ought to be more willing, since he s absolutely amazing and everyone he hates is the scum of the Earth.Some others answered Tyson s question in a salty way, too:@neiltyson Grope them?

Chuck Nice (@chucknicecomic) October 14, 2016And then there are these, which poke fun at Trump s, ahem, policy positions, among other things:@neiltyson Would Trump fund the building of a Dyson Sphere to keep  em out, or try to make aliens pay for it?  Freddy-Kruger Effect (@Jayextee) October 14, 2016@neiltyson he d have the best space aliens. His space aliens are going to be so great, my god, you won t even believe it.  Jessica Hellis (@baddestmamajama) October 14, 2016@neiltyson Trump would immediately have a wall built around the alien and not pay the mason.  Tom (@TommieWho) October 14, 2016Tyson may have started a tiny shitstorm with this, but it s funny. In the end, though, the answer to the Trump part of his question is this: Trump would very quietly let the aliens take us over through our computer systems, and conspire with them to take down all his enemies, including the Clintons.Then, when the questions and investigations reached their fever peak and everyone was clamoring to know what was going on, and he went on television to explain and reassure the public that he wasn t responsible for the chaos, he d look straight into the eyes of all of America, whip off his invisible glasses and say,  Aliens.

 BREAKING: Sheriff Calls For REBELLION After Donald Trump Calls Election ‘Rigged’ (VIDEO),"As Donald Trump s poll numbers drop, he continues to blame it on some vast conspiracy, saying that the election is being rigged. In response, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke wants civilians to take up  pitchforks and torches,  presumably in armed insurrection. He s not the first Trump supporter to make similar statements, and he won t be the last.Donald Trump is losing support, and will blame it on whatever he can to make himself look better. He s now referring to the election as  one big ugly lie,  and endangering the democratic process that defines our success as a nation.Here s the video, via HuffPo:Sheriff Clarke has previously said the Black Lives Matter and Occupy movements are anarchy, yet still tweets about taking up arms against the  corruption  in the federal government. He tweeted at 11:30 A.M. Saturday morning:  It s incredible that our institutions of gov, WH, Congress, DOJ, and big media are corrupt & all we do is bitch. Pitchforks and torches time . Trump has been known to encourage violence at his rallies and will likely continue to encourage behavior like this, escalating as we approach the election. Here are some examples from his Twitter account:As the election closes in, Trump is panicking and doing whatever he can to stay afloat. In the end, he is just going to embarrass himself more and more. If and when his rhetoric results in actual violence, he needs to be held accountable for the part he has played.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"October 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Fans Are Asked About ‘P*ssy Grabbing’ Remarks And It Gets REALLY Bad (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s lewd and predatory remarks about women is causing him to lose support with Republicans but his conservative followers just don t care. What s really alarming about this is that we even have to have a discussion to explain that sexual assault is a bad thing.The Daily Show s Jordan Klepper just confirmed that when visiting a Trump rally in Pennsylvania to get his supporters  take on the reality-show-star-turned-GOP-presidential-candidate s  Grab them by the pussy  comments.Klepper asked if Trump had finally crossed the line. One supporter said,  You know what? So what if he wants to grab pussy. I want to grab pussy. I wish I could grab pussy as much as he is. Klepper wondered how they felt about the candidate casually talking about sexual assault. One supporter said it was  just locker room talk. What do you mean?,  Klepper asked.  Guys in a bar talk that way when they see a pretty girl,  the man answered.One female Trump supporter said she s  heard worse. Another woman said,  It s locker room talk. That s what boys do.  It s worth noting here that Trump was not a boy when he made those remarks. He was 60 years old.Klepper told her,  I don t talk like that  then asked her if she has children.  I do,  the woman said. When asked if her children talk like that, she said no.  So not those boys,  Klepper said.  Do you have a husband?  he asked the woman. She said she is married.  Does he talk like that?  he asked.  No,  she said.  So not that boy,  he said.Klepper asked a young man if he uses that language and he said he did not. He asked whether his father talks like that and the young Trump supporter said no.  So who talks like that?  he asked of the man.  Well obviously Donald Trump,  he said.A couple was approached and asked the same question. As it happens, no one with any sense of decency talks like that but every Trump supporter excused their candidate s behavior.One man said,  Grab it while you can, Trump. When asked if there s anything the GOP presidential candidate could say that would make them not vote for him, one man said no while a woman said  No matter what he says, I will vote for Donald Trump. One was was asked if Trump said the n-word, would she still vote for him. She said that she would.One man said he  spoke to a lot of women  at the rally and half of them would  love to have their pussies snatched by Trump. One man s sexual assault,  he said  is another man s flirtation. Here s the video:These are actual voters. Be sure to grab them by the ballots on election day.

" Donald Trump Goes On INSANE Coke-Fueled Rant At Rally, Practically Tries To Incite Civil War (VIDEO)","In what may mark the absolute low point of this election, Donald Trump finally showed America what he meant when he promised the  shackles  were off. At a rally in New Hampshire   a state he is losing by five points   Trump told the gathered a mob of supporters vibrating with anger that the election was about to be stolen from them and Clinton will have no legitimacy as president. This is, in all of American history, unheard of. And things only got uglier from there.But let s back up.Near the beginning of Trump s spittle-laden rant, he once again claimed that he won the 2nd presidential debate and   without a hint of irony   also noted that the only reason Clinton won was that she was pumped full of drugs. As usual, Trump offered zero proof for this astonishing allegation. Athletes, they make them take a drug test, right. I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate,  Trump said. Why don t we do that? We should take a drug test, prior, because I don t know what s going on with her, but at the beginning of her last debate, she was all pumped up at the beginning, and at the end it was like,  Oh, take me down,   He then claimed Clinton could barely walk afterwards   again, something that bears absolutely no relationship to reality.Trump:  I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate because I don t know what s going on with her  pic.twitter.com/yYKy8VfmP5  Colin Jones (@colinjones) October 15, 2016Trump has long been noted for his uncanny ability to project his own character flaws onto his opponents. Trump, a known liar, calls people liars. Trump, an unstable narcissist, says others don t have a good temperament. Trump, a crook, will gladly accuse others of being crooked. And now, the man who spent the last two debates audibly sniffing into his microphone like a coke fiend has said Hillary Clinton was doping. The mind boggles.But Trump s speech went from the absurd to the dangerous when he began reinforcing the idea that Hillary Clinton and  the media  are stealing the election. Off-script and without prompting, Trump announced that Clinton should be in jail. Chants of  lock her up  followed swiftly.Trump says Clinton  should be in jail  & crowd responds with  Lock her up!  #nhpolitics pic.twitter.com/oT9sXnk7DK  David Bienick (@BienickWCVB) October 15, 2016He also turned up the volume on his accusations that Clinton would destroy the country.Hillary Clinton is ""plotting to destroy the sovereignty of this country,"" Trump says.

One man proudly boasts of planning to  racially profile  Hispanics, Syrians and  people who can t speak American  as they head to the polls.Meanwhile, Trump s real chances of winning continue to nose-dive. His base loves him. America hates him.

 WATCH: Tom Hanks Uses This Perfect Analogy To WRECK Trump,"Tom Hanks is definitely voting for Hillary Clinton and he perfectly explained why earlier this week.During an interview with the Press Association to promote his latest film, Hanks was asked about Donald Trump and his remarks about sexually assaulting women. He was at work, man,  Hanks began.  He wasn t in a locker room. He was at work. He was showing up to do a thing on camera. Look  I m offended as a man. I m not offended as a husband or a father. I m offended as a guy. That s just not right, I m sorry. It s not right at work, it s not right in the locker room. It s wrong, period. The end. That s all. Hanks also talk about why he is voting for Hillary Clinton by comparing this election to a root canal. It s kind of like if you have a horrible, painful tooth, and you need a root canal. Who are you going to see? A guy who says,  Oh, I think I can figure that out, how to do a root canal for you. Lay down.  Or are you going to see somebody who s done 6,000 of them. Has a degree on the wall and has a great history and expertise when it comes down to it. Here s the video of via YouTube:[ad3media campaign= 1153 ]But Hanks also put it another way after referring to Trump as a  self-involved gas bag. Look, if I have an abscessed tooth, and I need to see an oral surgeon, I m not going to go to the guy who says,  you know what, I think I can be a pretty good oral surgeon,  I m going to go to someone who has been doing it for 30 years and has handled it a million times. I am voting for Hillary Clinton because she is wildly, wildly qualified to be president of the United States at the same time with dealing after one damn thing after the other that the world has handed her.

 Watch Bill Maher Absolutely WRECK Red State Voters For Putting Party Over Humanity (VIDEO),"Bill Maher laid into red state voters on Friday night for sacrificing whatever humanity they had left to continue supporting Donald Trump.The Republican nominee s comments about groping women, the multiple allegations of sexual assault, and the new revelations that Trump hit on teen girls and even walked in on Miss Teen USA contestants while they were naked are still not enough to convince his supporters to dump him.But even if Republicans get rid of Trump, Maher wondered if they can ever rid their party of Trumpism.Writer Rebecca Traister said  no  because the GOP is  built on it.  She then explained that Trump s voters represent the kind of people who have been working to oppress women and minorities for over a century and that the Republican Party has allowed Trump s deplorables to gain a major foothold on the party. The fact is, Republican voters who knew they were going to be facing Hillary Clinton, who hate Barack Obama, who object to the people who vote for Democrats, people of color and women, selected a candidate who embodies the racism and sexism that are the very forces that kept people of color and women disenfranchised for centuries and away from the White House until now. They picked him. Indeed, they chose Trump to be their leader and now Republicans leaders are kicking themselves for doing it because they are losing control of their party to the base, which is bad if the GOP ever wants to win a general election again.Former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey said that we need to appeal to Trump supporters to call out Trump s behavior and comments toward women, saying that there are good people who are voting for Trump. But Maher doubted that Trump s voters have any humanity left to give damn. When I look at the electoral map, I see states that Trump apparently cannot possibly lose,  Maher pointed out. The pink are likely Republican and the red are, like he said,  I could shoot somebody in the middle of 5th Avenue and they wouldn t leave me.  The people of Idaho, Wyoming, Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Kentucky   I know they re Republican mostly, but they re human, right? These are human beings. What the f*ck does it take, in this country, to have being a human being supersede being a Republican? Here s the video via YouTube:At this point, if red state voters haven t seen the error of their ways they aren t going to do so by Election Day. They will vote for Trump, thus proving that they are nothing more than hateful uneducated sexist racist assholes who care more about watching the country burn than they do about making sure our great nation continues to strive on towards a better future. They don t care about America. They are not patriots. They are selfish people who surrendered their humanity a long time ago. They have turned into mere drones for the Republican Party. Even if the party had nominated Hitler for president these people would stand in line to shake his hand and then vote for him no matter the horrible things he has done. That s because even though these people claim to be  Christians,  the truth is that they sold their souls to the devil and the devil is apparently collecting on November 8th, which means it s up to the rest of us to make sure he loses.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservative Women Get Positively VICIOUS Explaining Why They WANT A President Trump (TWEETS),"Given how vile Trump s treatment of women is, it s an absolute wonder that any woman at all can tolerate voting for him. Yet, there are women all over Twitter who not only can vote for him, but will do it enthusiastically. Do they know something that women on the left don t? Sadly, it doesn t seem so. In fact, they seem impossibly ignorant about issues that directly affect them.The hashtag, #WomenWhoVoteTrump, seems to be a bit of a counter to #WhyWomenDontReport, in which women bared the pain of their harassment and assaults to the whole world. Misogynists worked their asses off shaming those women, too. #WomenWhoVoteTrump, however, seems to be nothing but attacks on Hillary and shaming victims of sexual assault. These aren t just impossibly tone-deaf, they re outright cruel.#womenwhovotetrump Know how to say no when it needs to be said. pic.twitter.com/DvMUCZbO31  jon amous (@staggerlee420) October 15, 2016I guess #womenwhovotetrump don t want to be slave to the government and brainwashed by the lying media. pic.twitter.com/QtTbk9onE0  jon amous (@staggerlee420) October 15, 2016Notice the emphasis on the word  man  below?

Very few have actually given an explanation of what makes Trump so good. They re sufferers of Hillary Derangement Syndrome, and have no idea what could happen to them under a President Trump:In other words, just going to work and getting through the day could suddenly become much more difficult if Trump is elected, simply because the president sets a major example for the rest of the country.We won t stoop to calling these women stupid. Rather, they re badly misinformed and unable to see that they re misinformed. By voting for Trump out of hatred for Hillary, they re trying to open a Pandora s box from which women might take decades to recover.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox News Host Dana Perino Is DONE Defending Republicans,"Fox News host Dana Perino is finally so sick and tired of Republicans supporting Donald Trump despite all of the sexual assault allegations that she will no longer defend them.During Friday s edition of The Five, host and former George W. Bush press secretary Dana Perino slammed Donald Trump for  talking about all of his accusers  and insulting them instead of focusing on attacking Hillary Clinton.Perino is also furious that Republicans are still defending Trump s predatory behavior. The Republicans that are defending this are really irritating me,  she said.  I ve been like Mount Vesuvius all day. Perino then specifically named Ben Carson and Jeff Sessions as just two of the many Republicans who remain on board the Trump train despite the Republican nominee s comments about groping women and the various allegations made against him by multiple women and the many past statements he has made that are now coming back to haunt him.And after Juan Williams joked that someone is going to call for cutting her mic, Perino took a serious tone, looked straight into the camera and while slicing the air with her hand told Republicans that she is  done  defending them. Yeah, because women should be seen and not heard, apparently. After 20 years of defending these guys, done. Here s the video via YouTube.Perino is not the only Republican woman who has stopped defending Republicans due to their refusal to unendorse Trump.Wisconsin GOP activist Marybeth Glenn quit the party entirely in a series of posts on Twitter blasting Republicans for being cowards and legitimizing charges that conservatives are sexists after she defended them for years. He (Trump) treats women like dogs, and you go against everything I   and other female conservatives   said you were & back down like cowards,  she wrote.  I m sooo done. If you can t stand up for women & unendorse this piece of human garbage, you deserve every charge of sexism thrown at you. Now Perino just became the first Republican woman on Fox News to say she is done defending the GOP.In their refusal to withdraw their support from Trump, the Republican Party is destroying themselves by offending women across the country and now it is costing them allies in states and in the media. This is something that may take generations for the party to recover from. Of course, that s assuming they actually learn anything from the mess they made this year.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Law & Order: SVU To Air Episode Based On Donald Trump Child Sex Abuse Case,"We were all waiting for this. Law & Order: SVU has announced that they will be doing an episode based on Donald Trump s child rape case   and it will air before the election.The NBC show has often made episodes that are  ripped from the headlines,  and now they will take on Trump s alleged rape of 13-year-old girl. The episode, titled  Unstoppable,  will feature a Trump-like character who will be played by Gary Cole ( Veep ). Variety described this character as a  wealthy and boorish man who makes a run for the White House. The storyline of the episode was inspired by the lawsuit filed by a woman, known only as  Jane Doe,  who has accused Donald Trump of raping her at the home of known child abuser Jeffery Epstein in the mid-1990s when she was only 13. A hearing on the case, which names both Trump and Epstein as defendants in the suit, is scheduled for December 16 in a New York court.According to Variety, the episode, which was  penned by SVU veteran Julie Martin and showrunner Rick Eid, has been highly scrutinized internally at Wolf Entertainment, home of SVU, and by NBC brass.  Originally, the episode was set to be aired Oct. 12 and was then pushed back to Nov. 9, the day after election day. But NBC has now confirmed that the show will now air on Oct. 26, before the Nov. 8 election.NBC has been dead smack in the middle of Trump s  Pussygate  controversy. Audio tapes were released from a 2005 Access Hollywood segment that featured the billionaire bragging about his ability to sexually assault women thanks to his celebrity status. The GOP nominee s poll numbers have plummeted since the release of the tape, in which he said being  a star  made it permissible for him to  grab em [women] by the pussy.  Dozens of Republican leaders and members of congress have dropped him like a hot potato as well.Trump and NBC have quite a history. His shows, The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice, ran on the network for more than a decade. NBCUniversal also co-owned the Miss Universe beauty pageant franchise with Trump up until just last year.With evidence that Trump is a sexual predator continuing to pile up, it was only a matter of time before SVU picked up the story. I guess Donald Trump really is the Law & Order candidate after all.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images",News,"October 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Got One Of His Victims’ RELATIVES To Stab Her In The Back And Twist,"Donald Trump s damage control regarding his penchant for sexually assaulting women is reaching ever-darker corners of evilness. One of his accusers, Summer Zervos, who was a contestant on  The Apprentice  in 2006, and is a restaurant owner, is now being called a vindictive liar for coming forward about her experience with Trump.By her own first cousin, John Barry.According to Zervos, Trump got very physical with her: He put me in an embrace and I tried to push him away. I pushed his chest to put space between us and I said,  Come on man, get real.  He repeated my words back to me,  Get real,  as he began thrusting his genitals. Trump, of course, denies this and has dug up Barry to issue a statement that is absolutely vile   and is just another reason why so many of his victims stayed silent. This is Barry s full statement: I am completely shocked and bewildered by my cousin, Summer Zervos, and her press conference today. Ever since she was on The Apprentice she has had nothing but glowing things to say about Mr. Trump. For almost a decade, my cousin would talk about how much she looked up to Mr. Trump and viewed him as an inspiration   a success story she wanted to copy. Summer would also talk about how kind and caring Mr. Trump was on the show, and how he would even visit children in hospitals without telling the press. She has praised the good things he s done for her life, and in fact she converted her friends and our family to become Trump supporters even though we ve never been active in politics before.That was until Summer invited Mr. Trump to her restaurant during the primary and he said no. I think Summer wishes she could still be on reality TV, and in an effort to get that back she s saying all of these negative things about Mr. Trump. That s not how she talked about him before. I can only imagine that Summer s actions today are nothing more than an attempt to regain the spotlight at Mr. Trump s expense, and I don t think it reflects well. In a nutshell, Barry alleges that Zervos praised Trump and spoke glowingly of him for years, which obviously means she s lying now. The fact that Trump turned down an invitation of hers just further proves that she s out for revenge, and was never assaulted.There s even an email below Barry s statement that must, obviously, be rock-solid proof that Zervos is lying through her teeth.Right.Because that s always the way it goes. It doesn t even occur to Barry or anyone who believes him that she might have behaved that way out of fear that Trump would ruin her if she did anything. Trump is rich, powerful, impossibly vengeful, and has resources she can t even begin to dream of.In fact, fear of retaliation is one of the primary reasons sexual assault victims stay silent. Does anybody really believe that she could take on a man like Donald Trump, and actually come out of it in one piece? Other than misogynistic jerkwads who think women are to blame for rape culture because they stay silent?Trump and his brainwashed puddles of rotting pig vomit believe that all of this is just too coincidental   that all these women are ganging up on him specifically to derail his campaign. He s creating bizarre theories of a global conspiracy against him, orchestrated by the Clintons, and carried out by multiple institutions with whom he has a gripe.The truth is that he s a sad, paranoid, disgusting excuse of a pig who preys on women because he thinks they re only around to help him get his rocks off.Photo of Summer Zervos by Frederick M.

 BREAKING: Trump Supporters Busted By FBI For Plotting MASSIVE Terrorist Attack,"The FBI thwarted an act of domestic terrorism on Friday when they arrested three white men for plotting to blow up an apartment complex in Kansas.Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright, and Patrick Stein were all taken into custody after an investigation that took eight months busted the trio for planning a massive terrorist attack in Garden City.Their target was an apartment complex and a mosque that serviced 120 Somali refugees.According to KWCH, United States Attorney Tom Beall said  the men stockpiled a large cache of firearms, and ammunition. Beall said the men planned to park vehicles full of explosives at all four corners of the Garden City apartment complex. The men said they wanted to  wake people up .Beall said the men wrote a manifesto, which they wanted published after the bombing.According to an affidavit, the were a part of a group called the Kansas Security Force and the Crusaders. These are militia groups whose members support and espouse sovereign citizen, anti-government, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs,  read the affidavit.The three men had planned to carry out the attack on November 9th, one day after Election Day.And as it turns out, Curtis Allen is a supporter of Donald Trump and his Facebook page is full of anti-Muslim rhetoric. I personally back Donald Trump,  an unhinged Allen wrote in a post ranting about how Hillary Clinton is supposedly going to put Americans in FEMA camps and take all guns away.Allen was also particularly paranoid about Muslims. Here is just a sampling of his posts.Clearly, this guy hates Muslims, and his hate and paranoia was only perpetuated by Republican nominee Donald Trump.Trump has built his campaign on bashing Muslims, especially Muslim refugees. So Allen decided to join with two other guys in an effort to kill Muslims. Whether the other two are Trump supporters as well is not known, but this is how dangerous Donald Trump has become in our country. He is making right-wing nut jobs blood thirsty and paranoid enough to commit acts of domestic terrorism.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"October 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Billionaire Richard Branson Breaks Silence About Trump, Exposes Truth About His ‘Temperament’ (TWEETS)","Up until this point, Mark Cuban has been one of the most outspoken billionaires going after Trump and begging America to vote for Hillary Clinton in November. Today, it seems like another business mogul is ready to join Cuban s cause and tell America to wake the hell up.Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, has finally spoken out against Trump and has done so via a brutal statement on his company s website. His statement opened with something that most of us   especially Cuban   could agree with. Branson said: I want an entrepreneur to become president one day   just not Donald Trump. In railing against the disgraced GOP candidate, Branson didn t hold back in telling Americans that Trump is such a horrendous excuse for a candidate, that many of Branson s conservative wealthy colleagues cannot even bring themselves to vote for him, even though they may have voted Republican religiously in the past. Branson said: Quite a few of my American friends, especially some very successful entrepreneurs, are registered Republicans. They have told me they are unable to vote for Donald Trump due to his extreme views, and his shocking ignorance of policy. Branson continued to trash Trump while showering his opponent in compliments, stating that Clinton is a safe pair of hands and a leader of supreme experience and knowhow. TwitterThen, Branson got real on Trump s temperament, because apparently some people need to be reminded over and over again how dangerous it is to have a ticking time bomb with the maturity of a three-year-old in the White House: On the other hand, Mr Trump s temperament is irrational, aggressive and he lacks informed ideas on how to grow jobs in America. An entrepreneur president would put that at the heart of his plans and yet his fear-based campaign blames immigrants and open borders. America was built upon a collective embracing of diversity and openness   not division and close-mindedness. There are too many examples of Mr Trump s lack of empathy and respect to name. I agree with many on both sides of America s political aisle that he is unfit for office. TwitterBranson concluded by urging Americans to  make sure you vote for your future  and not be misled by uninformed, inflammatory remarks.

 Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him By Marlee Matlin For Calling Deaf People ‘Retarded’,"Marlee Matlin may have had no comment on Thursday when it was revealed that Donald Trump called her  retarded  because she is deaf, but she destroyed him on Friday for it. Recent media reports have circulated that Donald Trump allegedly referred to me as  retarded,  the AcademyAward-winning actress wrote on Twitter.  The term is abhorrent and should never be used. The fact that we are talking about this during a very important moment in U.S. history has upset me deeply. Trump used the term during Matlin s stint on Celebrity Apprentice back in 2011. During filming on the  boardroom  set, the Republican nominee wrote down a question on a piece of paper asking if Matlin is  retarded.  He also often mocked her voice and insulted her face to face and behind her back.Matlin continued her condemnation of Trump by pointing out that there are millions of Americans who are hearing impaired and said she plans to use her voice to vote against him in November. I am Deaf. There are millions of Deaf and hard of hearing people like me, in the United States and around the world who face discrimination and misunderstanding like this on a daily basis. It is unacceptable. So what s my response? It s not about insults or taking each other down. As a person who is Deaf, as a woman, as a mom, as a wife, as an actor, I have a voice. And I m using that voice to make myself heard and vote. My response to recent media reports   Marlee. pic.twitter.com/Mkrbh47dUO  Marlee Matlin (@MarleeMatlin) October 14, 2016Donald Trump has alienated just about everyone in America except racist white guys and he should pay the price for that on Election Day.

 Bernie Sanders Just Crashed This Greedy Drug Company’s Stock With One Tweet,"It appears that former Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has tanked a drug company s stock with just one tweet. The tweet was directed towards Ariad Pharmaceuticals. Ariad owns a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia calledIclusig . Ariad has raised the price of the drug four times in recent history.The last time the raised the price of the drug, it went up 27 percent at a cost of $16,560 dollars a month, or nearly $199,000 a year. The price hike doubled Ariad s sales totals up to $65 million dollars in just one quarter.The tweet that was sent out said: Drug corporations  greed is unbelievable. Ariad has raised the price of a leukemia drug to almost $199,000 a year. Drug corporations' greed is unbelievable. Ariad has raised the price of a leukemia drug to almost $199,000 a year. https://t.co/EB4nEPxP2G  Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) October 14, 2016The tweet also included a link to an article about the company s continual price increases.Bloomberg reports that after Sanders (or most likely one of his staffers) sent out the tweet, Ariad s stock value dropped by as much as 15 percent   one of the worst days the company has had in more than a year.At of the time this writing, the tweet doesn t appear to have gone viral compared to many of the Senator s other social media postings, with only 1.1k retweets and 1.5k likes. Though that may change as more attention to the story and Sanders  help in making the issue be known grows. Much in the same way that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s tweet sent stocks crashing in the biotech industry after she spoke out against price gouging.Price-gouging in the pharmaceutical industry is a hot button issue. From Martin  Pharma bro  Shkreli and his raising the price of a certain AIDS medication made by Turing Pharmaceuticals, to Mylan s jacking the price up of EpiPens, people have raised the digital equivalents of torches and pitchforks over these price increases.It s important to keep in mind that this is a problem that is industry wide. One study found that prescription drug prices have been skyrocketing for more than five years. While drug companies that take part in the practice need to be called out and have the screws put on them by the public, the only way this problem is going to end is when people stand up and demand real change in the healthcare industry as a whole. That will probably mean switching to a national health care system   like every other developed nation on the planet.Featured image from Alex Wong/Getty Images with tweet screenshot added",News,"October 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Absolutely DEPLORABLE Audio Shows Trump Jr. To Be Just As Disgusting Toward Women As His Dad,"The apple never falls far from the tree, and Trump s kids do everything they can to prove that saying true. Donald Trump Jr. took a page straight out of rape culture in an interview on the  Opie and Anthony Show,  where he said that women who can t handle sexual harassment in the workplace  don t belong in the workforce. If you can t handle some of the basic stuff that s become a problem in the workforce today, like, you don t belong in the workforce. Like, you should go maybe teach kindergarten. I think it s a respectable position.You can t be negotiating billion-dollar deals if you can t handle, like, you know. Now, why didn t anybody think of that before? It s so stupid it s positively brilliant!Or maybe the men who are likewise negotiating that deal Trump Jr. talks about above should, you know, maybe keep their mouths shut and their eyes and minds focused on the negotiations. But hey, Trump and his son will say what they want. Boys will be boys, right? Right. Because men can t control themselves and their base instincts so it s always on women to make sure men stay off of us.And you just have to love that implication that teaching kindergarten (and by extension, teaching anything at all) isn t a real job in the workforce, so it s okay for women to have those jobs. Trump Jr. clearly sees women as second-class citizens   people to be seen and not heard (and in some cases, probably not seen, either, just like his disgusting father thinks).To make matters worse, the whole interview sounds like they think they re doing nothing more than harmless  locker room talk,  with the hosts saying things like: That s the problem with women. They complain and they fuck it up. Like I don t like being around just men, I love when women are around, but they complain,  Oh it s harassment,  and that s why we hate them around because they stop us from doing what we want to do. Which is, in part, talking about women in a disgusting, derogatory manner, no doubt. They re blaming women for having the audacity to demand to be treated like human beings.Trump s mini-me of a son also implied that the primary reason women complain and sue for harassment is to get rich: Wouldn t it be funny if we showed tits and then Donald sued?  one asked. I d feel harassed!  Trump Jr. joked.  This is my get-rich-quick scheme. I m now suing you guys because I feel uncomfortable.' It s not just the GOP candidate for president. It s his whole family who thinks this way. Anyone who thinks that Donald Trump would be a good example, a good role model for children need only look at his own children to know that s not true.Listen to the whole interview segment below:Featured image by John Moore via Getty Images",News,"October 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump On Accusations Of Sexual Assault: Mexico Did It,"Donald Trump is backed into a corner. After he was caught on tape admitting to sexually assaulting women, surprise! several women have come out saying Trump sexually assaulted them. He s running out of defenses, so Trump turned to one of his old hits. He s blaming the accusations on the Mexicans. Well, one Mexican in particular: billionaire Carlos Slim.As early as Friday, Mr. Trump is planning to claim that Mr. Slim, as a shareholder of New York Times Co. and donor to the Clinton Foundation, has an interest in helping Hillary Clinton s campaign, according to a Trump adviser.Attacking the Mexican billionaire would allow Mr. Trump to hit several targets. He could slam the  failing  New York Times, which he says had to be  rescued  by a  foreigner    Mr. Slim, the adviser said.Source: VoxUnfortunately, this is how Trump sees the world. People are either with him or against him. Not surprisingly for the controversial land developer, Trump has made a lot of enemies, and it appears those enemies are spread throughout the world. That alone should disqualify him for the position that is in large part, diplomacy.Beyond that, though, this is a man who refuses to take responsibility for his own actions. He admitted on tape the he grabs women  by the pussy.  Why should it surprise anyone that he actually grabbed some? Here s a list of all the women who (so far) have accused Trump. Even if Trump is right that it s some sort of personal vendetta by the New York Times (he s not), reports have come out in the Daily Beast, from CBS News, from a People Magazine reporter, from the Palm Beach Post, from Rolling Stone, from BuzzFeed, from the Guardian, from Vanity Fair, from USA Today, from Jezebel, from the New Yorker and from the Washington Post.Gotta wonder how he s going to blame the Mexicans (or perhaps the Chinese) on all of these.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images.",News,"October 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SICK: Trump Told 14-Year-Old Girls He Would Be Dating Them In A Couple Years,"Another bit of news from the past has come back to haunt Donald Trump s already imploding campaign.Only days after an Entertainment Tonight clip went viral showing Donald Trump talking about how he will be dating the 10-year-old girl he just met in ten years, the Chicago Tribune dug into their own archives to find another disturbing news blurb quoting Trump speaking to a pair of 14-year-old girls in 1992. In a December 1992 wire brief in the Chicago Tribune, Trump is described as having spotted a youth choir singing Christmas carols at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan,  the Tribune reported.  He asked two girls how old they were. When they said they were 14, Trump, then 46, replied,  Wow! Just think   in a couple of years, I ll be dating you. Here s the news clipping via the Chicago Tribune. The bit about Trump is at the lower right hand corner under the yellow highlight.There you have it. Donald Trump jumped from disgustingly talking about him dating a 10-year-old girl in ten years to directly telling two 14-year-old girls that he will be dating them in two years. For the record, both girls would still be considered minors under the law. Furthermore, Trump s own daughter Ivanka was 11-years-old at the time, which makes these revelations even creepier.Trump has been under fire for over a week now since his remarks about groping women came to light. Accusations of sexual assault from multiple women, including Miss Teen USA contestants who have revealed that Trump walked in on them in their dressing room to see them naked, have flooded the media ever since and the Republican nominee is struggling to explain himself and his predatory behavior.These revelations also give more credibility to a child rape case that Trump is currently embroiled in, which goes to a status conference in December that Trump must attend. The lawsuit was filed by a woman only known as Jane Doe, who says Trump raped her in 1994 when she was 13 years old.And given the fact that Trump apparently likes openly hitting on underage girls, it sounds like Jane Doe has a case.Donald Trump is a sick man and a pervert who should not be anywhere close to being President of the United States. But Republicans chose him to be their leader and now America is living a nightmare that can only end if Trump and the GOP loses by a total landslide on November 8th.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"October 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Texas Church Rejects Man For Being Gay, But He Gets The Last Laugh A Year Later","This church congregation should be ashamed.After all, it was a year ago that Watermark Community Church sent a letter to Jason Thomas formally rejecting him as a member of the church simply because he is gay. In our attempt to shepherd you, we have recognized a destructive pattern that prohibits us in caring for you and playing the role you desire for us to have in your life,  the letter stated.  Specifically, your desire to actively participate in a same-sex relationship with another man, and your unwillingness to heed biblical counsel from your church to turn from that relationship, has made it exceedingly difficult to shepherd you during this time. The church goes on to claim in the letter that they  value the way God has uniquely formed you,  but wants him to change by following the church s counsel and to meet a person named Brandon who has similar homosexual feelings. Notice how the church literally outed Brandon?Anyway, Jason clearly was not welcome back to the church unless he agreed to be someone he is not so he stayed far away. One year later, Jason is happy and is comfortable with who he is and with his sexuality. So he wrote a reply to Watermark Community Church informing them that their choice to reject him was the best thing that could have happened to him.Here s is the full letter via Pink News.Dear Watermark Community Church,Today I celebrate a very interesting anniversary with you. It was exactly one year ago when you told me that I was no longer worthy to serve, be in a community group, and be a member of your church.I spent years in your church battling against my homosexuality. I believed with all my heart that God would change me; I prayed for change almost daily. But when I wasn t able to change, you turned your back on me.You say our  sin  is not unique, but you treat us in a unique manner; this is unacceptable behaviour. We are actual people that have actual feelings.Here we are a year later and you are still doing to others what you did to me. You are tarnishing the name of God to Christians and non-Christians alike; you should be ashamed of yourselves! Do not forget, Jesus was angry with people just like you who said certain groups of people were not worthy to be followers of Him.Thank you for removing yourself from my life! I am who God made me to be. I cannot change my sexual orientation and nor would I want to. I now have internal peace and happiness unlike ever before.Jason ThomasIndeed, while this church is busy persecuting people for being gay, there are almost certainly many members of the church who commit adultery or other sins on a daily basis who are not being rejected by the church like Jason. Even the church elders are not without sin yet they are busy hypocritically casting stones at people who are gay.Watermark responded to Jason by telling the Dallas News that,  An individual s formal relationship with us as a member is only changed when someone no longer desires to resist sin and refuses our help, care and encouragement. Even if someone s formal membership status is removed, they are always welcome to attend Watermark and be reminded of the grace and truth of our savior Jesus Christ. Yeah, that s complete bullshit and is exactly why more and more people are no longer attending church. Jesus said  love thy neighbor as thyself,  but apparently this church isn t a fan of Jesus  teachings, which did not include ostracizing gay people.Featured Image: i.ytimg.com",News,"October 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ben Carson Just Totally Lost His Sh*t On MSNBC When Asked About Trump’ Sexual Assaults (VIDEO),"When Ben Carson was asked about the multiple women accusing Donald Trump of sexually assaulting them, he proceeded to completely freak the f*ck out.Appearing on MSNBC s Morning Joe, Ben Carson was questioned about the long list of women alleging that they were sexually assaulted by the billionaire GOP nominee. BBC reporter Katty Kay pressed Carson, asking whether or not he thinks the women accusing Trump are lying. Infuriated, Carson cut her off. That s your characterization because you need to characterize it that way to make me the bad guy,  Carson said.When Kay didn t drop the subject and continued to pursue the matter of Trump s sexual assaults, the former presidential candidate cut her off yet again. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Can you turn her mic off please? Turn her mic off so I can talk. Host Joe Scarborough laughed and said that  no,  her microphone would not be shut off.

 Mike Pence Tries To Talk Sh*t About Michelle Obama; Falls On Face HARD (VIDEO),"Appearing on CBS This Morning, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence was left floundering for responses to questions he clearly did not want to be asked.For one, he was asked to respond to Michelle Obama s remarks surrounding his running-mate Donald Trump being a sexual predator.Yesterday, while speaking at a Clinton campaign event in New Hampshire, the First Lady stated: This is not something that we can ignore. It s not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season. Because this was not just a lewd conversation; this wasn t just locker room banter. This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior and actually bragging about kissing and groping women using language so obscene that many of us worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV. And to make matters worse, it now seems very clear that this isn t an isolated incident   it s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life. She added: Too many are treating this as just another day s headline. As if our outrage is overblown or unwarranted. As if this is normal. Be clear: this is not normal. This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. It is intolerable. And it doesn t matter what party you belong to: Democrat, Independent, Republican   no woman deserves to be treated this way. None of us deserves this kind of abuse  This isn t about politics, it s about basic human decency. This Morning Co-host Norah O Donnell asked Pence about these remarks, but Pence decided to respond with this: Look I have a lot of respect for the First Lady  But I don t understand the basis of her claim. Someone flabbergasted that Pence was seemingly saying that Michelle Obama went too far, O Donnell followed up with: You don t believe his language was  sexually predatory? He was then left to put together words, in no particular order, that tried to defend Trump and his actions. Keep in mind Pence condemned Trump s remarks that came out of the leaked Access Hollywood tape, but now he doesn t seem to believe any of the victims coming forward that state Trump did exactly what he stated on that leaked tape.Someone should let him know he can t talk out of both sides of his mouth on this issue. Someone else should let him know that you don t halfass insult First Lady Michelle Obama and think he can get away with it.Pence then pivoted fast away from the questions that left him flat on his face.If Pence wasn t such a jerk himself, you could almost feel bad for the guy for needing to defend his sexual predator running-mate, but this is might just be sweet karma for all the sh*tty things Pence has done legislatively to women and the LGBT community over the years.Watch the video here:Mike Pence is so pathetic. #PatheticPence pic.twitter.com/iJ4rKyCp3P  Sarah Wood (@SarahWoodwriter) October 14, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" REPORT: Donald Trump LIED About Donating To 9/11 Charities, Didn’t Donate Until He Was Campaigning (DETAILS)","Donald Trump has called himself a patriot many times, yet according to recent investigations he didn t donate a penny to 9/11 charities, despite claiming otherwise. That definitely doesn t seem very patriotic.Mr. Billionaire Trump promised to donate $10,000 to a major 9/11 charity, yet the money was never received. To a billionaire, $10,000 is pocket change, so why didn t he actually give it to the charities? Is he really that greedy? Leave it to Trump to make a scene, order more fame and attention, only to have made the whole thing up.NY Daily News says:City Controller Scott Stringer conducted a review of hundreds of pages of previously sealed records of the two main 9/11 charities at the request of the Daily News, and found that Trump and his charity hadn t donated a dime in the months after 9/11.It s not unlike Trump to want more public attention and create whatever lie necessary for that attention; however, even for a pig like him, this is a bit too far.Not until April of 2016   while running for president   did Donald Trump actually donate money to a 9/11 related cause. During his first visit to the September 11th Museum Memorial he made another grand scene while donating $100,000 dollars to the museum. This time the money was actually received, but we can safely bet it s only because of how much attention is on him.This goes to show Donald Trump is only  charitable  when it suits him. And it s not even really charity   he s buying publicity, not donating money, in his view. He s always been a lying, scandalous pig, yet now could quite possibly the next president of our country. Let s make sure that doesn t happen come November.Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"October 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Armed Trump Supporters ‘Stand Their Ground’ Outside Female Dem. Candidate’s Campaign Office For 12 Hours,"Two Donald Trump supporters openly carrying firearms lurked outside of a a Democratic candidate s office for 12 hours on Thursday. Apparently, President Barack HUSSEIN Obama s evil gun confiscation unit hadn t arrived yet. It s perfectly legal to open carry firearms in Virginia but intimidating a candidate or any person for that matter is a perversion of the Second Amendment.One of the protesters, Daniel Parks, told Newsplex that he hopes to encourage Trump supporters to stand up for what they believe in. We suppose Parks thinks Trump supporters have been timid during this election cycle. I m just trying to provide a voice for someone who might be closet supporters of Trump. Other people that are a little worried to speak out because of possible persecution,  Parks said.As for  persecution,  Parks suffers from a case of projection. Also in his hand, Parks held a copy of the Constitution.The two armed men stood outside of a female candidate s office for hours.Parks and another Trump supporter who later joined him outside the campaign of the campaign office Democrat Jane Dittmar s office in Palmyra, Virginia, were openly carrying guns, Su Wolff, a volunteer for Dittmar, told Newsplex.Wolff said that the most disturbing part of the protest was that both of them started exposing their firearms. He turned sideways to be sure that we would see that he has an open carry gun, which is legal, it s fine, but it s intimidating,  Wolff said of one of the protesters.  If he wants to support his candidate that s fine, but don t come here and stare into the office all day. Parks said that his firearm is legal, and that he meant no harm in carrying it outside of the Democratic candidate s office. We re not a threat to anybody, the only threat is ignorance, and ignorance breeds fear,  Parks said.On Thursday, it was reported that Trump is  pulling out of Virginia,  in a move which stunned staffers in the battleground state. Still yet, Parks said he s not giving up. He might be pulling out, but we re not pulling out, and I m gonna stand my ground and speak out for what I believe in,  Parks said.Parks is planning a similar protest in Richmond later this year.Dittmar is not running against Donald Trump, for the record. She is running against State Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. (R) for the 5th Congressional District seat which is currently held by Rep. Robert Hurt, who is not seeking re-election, TPM reports.The two men must represent Trump s  Second Amendment people  which the GOP presidential candidate spoke of earlier this year when he issued a veiled threat to Hillary Clinton.Image via screen capture.

 Trump Supporter Threatens Montel Williams So He Publicly Humiliates Her Into Oblivion,"Montel Williams is an outspoken opponent of Donald Trump s campaign and has been hitting the Republican nominee particularly hard as of late over his predatory sexual behavior.Here goes accused predator @realDonaldTrump lying about the black community again  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) October 13, 2016 Boys will be boys, but boys will not be President    Ronald Reagan.Donald Trump will NEVER be President.  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) October 13, 2016DONALD TRUMP IS A DAMN PEDOPHILE. PERIOD  FULL STOP. pic.twitter.com/UK6AF3GjjI  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) October 13, 2016So Trump defender Scottie Nell Hughes responded by privately threatening to bring up sexual misconduct accusations against Williams. Bc I appreciate you and don t want to publicly bring up a bad moment in your life but please be careful publicly going against me Bc others might not have a loyalty to you,  she wrote.Rather than bow down to such threat, Williams called Hughes out publicly on Twitter and posted her message for all to see. Trumpers in general: careful threatening me when you don t know what I know and can tell reporters,  Williams fired back.@scottienhughes /Trumpers in general: careful threatening me when you don t know what I know and can tell reporters  pic.twitter.com/D1kz95gpSE  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) October 14, 2016It turns out Hughes was referencing sexual assault allegations which Williams was exonerated for in a court of law.Seeing her error, Hughes claimed she wasn t threatening Williams and claimed she was just  being a friend.  But Williams was having none of it.Yes you were and it s a damn stupid one at that given the case was tossed and the lawyer who filed it sanctioned ;) https://t.co/LH7cijIUKs  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) October 14, 2016An embarrassed Hughes then offered a pathetic apology to stop the bleeding.@Montel_Williams well I apologize you took it that way Bc unfortunately the part about the lawyer is not highly reported as much. I am sorry  Scottie Nell Hughes (@scottienhughes) October 14, 2016But Williams didn t accept.Scottie was referencing series of frivolous  sexual harassment  lawsuits filed against me. I won EACH AND EVERY ONE https://t.co/Wph3higga0 pic.twitter.com/MjfgBzQ3IV  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) October 14, 2016I didn t settle a one of those cases because I was innocent, so much so the Judge fined the lawyer who filed them 15k https://t.co/4AZbliptFr  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) October 14, 2016In a statement provided to Raw Story, Williams explained that while Hughes has only known Trump for a few months, she clearly doesn t know him like he does. Scottie has known Donald a few months, I ve known him more than 20 years. It would be unwise for her or any of these folks from central casting posing as surrogates to threaten me. They have no idea the damage me deciding to talk to a reporter about what I know would cause. Hughes responded on Twitter by playing the victim as if she did nothing wrong by casually making threats to someone she considers a friend. No messages from you sorry or I would have responded that MW and I have had friendly convos since 14. Sorry. I guess I misunderstood how polite our friendship was and very disappointed he has that low of respect for me. Threatening to smear a person s reputation is not what any good friend does. But that s what Hughes did even though Williams was found totally innocent of the allegations against him. Hughes deserved to be humiliated in public, and by sharing the threat publicly, Williams showed the world just how low Trump s minions are willing to sink.Featured image via Facebook",News,"October 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Man Almost Dies On Flight Because Crew Didn’t Think Black Women Can Be Doctors,"A man almost lost his life on a flight out of Detroit because of a racist flight crew member who apparently forgot that it s 2016 and black women are allowed to be doctors. I know, it seems shocking to someone with that mindset, but we re pretty much over the who  not allowing someone to follow their dreams and live up to their potential because of their skin color  thing. Unfortunately, the crew of Delta flight DL945 didn t get the memo.When a passenger became unresponsive during the flight, the crew leaped into action looking for a doctor   and Dr. Tamika Cross would have done so as well, if they thought someone with her dark complexion was capable of being a medical professional. On Facebook, Cross vented her frustration with representatives of the airline:When Cross initially attempted to inform the crew she was a doctor by raising her hand as she was asked, she was flatly told her silly dark-skinned medical knowledge was useless to them   even though a man was dying. Oh no sweetie put ur hand down, we are looking for actual physicians or nurses or some type of medical personnel, we don t have time to talk to you,  Cross says a flight attendant informed her, overtalking her attempts to explain that she is a licensed medical professional with condescension. Any physician on board please press your button  the crew urged, as no one but Cross had responded. She pushed her button.  Oh wow you re an actual physician?  the flabbergasted crew member asked before demanding to see Cross s credentials and asking a series of questions that should not be asked when a man is dying and time is of the essence:   What type of doctor are you? Where do you work? Why were you in Detroit? Fortunately, a white man stepped forward to save the day because the crew obviously was having a tough time finding a doctor who met their qualifications (apparently white skin being the qualification). Cross was told  thanks for your help but he can help us, and he has his credentials.  He did not, in fact, show the crew anything, Cross points out in her post.After Mr. White Doctor saved the day, the same crew member had the nerve to come to Cross with questions about treatment before ultimately  apologizing  for her blatantly racist behavior and trying to bribe Cross with skymiles. Cross refused.Unfortunately, while we have made great progress, we still have a long way to go in terms of race relations in America   and Delta is not going to have a very good week trying to make this problem go away.Featured image via Facebook",News,"October 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama Just Warned Trump: Don’t Attack My Wife Or There Will Be Hell To Pay,"The White House has warned Donald Trump not to turn his attacks to Michelle Obama, or things could get quite rough for him. I can t think of a bolder way for Donald Trump to lose even more standing than he already has than by engaging the First Lady of the United States,  principal deputy White House press secretary Eric Schultz told reporters aboard Air Force One. To date, The Donald has largely stayed away from attacking the First Lady, with his one reference to her   a blatantly false claim that she attacked Clinton in political ads   only serving to embarrass him. I ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary,  Trump said at the debate, earning him a collective eyeroll from America and a  false  from PolitiFact. In reality, Obama has campaigned hard for Clinton.Schultz is right: if Trump begins attacking the First Lady, a woman who is admired by people on both sides of the political aisle and who (for the most part) avoids engaging in politics, it will show that he truly has no shame   if The Wall, a proposed Muslim ban, grabbing women  by the pussy,  courting white supremacists, and a f*cking child rape case had not managed to make that clear already.Schultz s warning is a good one: there is nothing The Donald can do strip what little legitimacy his campaign has ever had than to attack a woman whose primary concern for the last eight years has been making sure children are educated and fed. The blowback would be something even Trump could not handle.Of course, Trump will likely view this as a challenge   but even if he doesn t go on the attack, his  deplorables have had him covered in that area for years.On Thursday, Michelle Obama didn t attack Trump, but she very poignantly pointed out exactly how awful he is.

 Meet The Cowardly Republicans Who Re-Endorsed Trump After Condemning Him For Sexual Assault,"Republicans everywhere have been denouncing Trump for his boasts about sexually assaulting women, but it seems that they can t stick to their guns. In a very cowardly move, four Republicans have re-endorsed him, one has knuckled under and stayed quiet, and more are sure to follow both of these leads. These weak-kneed, spineless rat turds are busy putting party over country, and it s disgusting.First up: Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska. She made her position clear on the radio shortly after the worst weekend Trump has ever had. As a woman, there is no way she should still support him, and yet, she does for some sick reason: Well, like most Nebraskans, I am fully committed to defeating Hillary Clinton. I support the Republican ticket and I plan to vote for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence on November 8th. She went on to say that she d never said she wouldn t vote for the GOP ticket, which is likely true, but smacks of making excuses. All she s done is show that beating Hillary is more important than the very real danger of legitimizing sexual crimes, and making a predator into a role model for our children. Giving in to that ideology is the move of a coward.Senator John Thune of South Dakota is next. He tweeted that Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should take over. Now, though? He s caved like the chickenshit he is, too. He said: He has a lot of work to do, I think, to win this election. But I m certainly not going to vote for Hillary Clinton. So vote for Evan McMullin   at least he s respectable, knowledgeable and sane, unlike Trump and his minions.New Jersey Congressman Scott Garrett said that he felt Mike Pence was a better candidate than Trump following Trump s unmasking as a sexual predator. However, Garrett s campaign has since said that he still feels Trump is the best candidate to lead our country. His spokesman said, in part: Donald Trump remains the nominee of the Republican Party, and Rep. Garrett has always said he will vote for the Republican Party nominee. Scott Garrett s top priority in this election is stopping the Clinton-Gottheimer agenda of higher taxes, more wasteful spending, and weak national security policy. All important issues, but dismissing half the electorate by essentially saying,  Sure, we care about you, but your problems with sexual assault are just not that important,  right now is clueless and vile. It s typical sexism, actually.In fourth place, but tied for first, is Congressman Bradley Byrne of Alabama. We probably shouldn t be surprised that an official from Alabama would decide to support Trump, though, even after sixteen straight months of rotting vomit spewing forth from his mouth. Byrne was one of the first officials in Alabama to call on Trump to step down, but apparently, that s all changed now that it s been a week since Trump s  hot mic  tape was released.Byrne s spokesman, Seth Burrow, said: He will support the Republican ticket on Election Day, as he has pledged to do all along. He just believes that person should be Mike Pence. He just believes that person should be Mike Pence,  is one of the worst cop-outs in the long, sad history of bad cop-outs.And last, but certainly not least, is Paul Ryan. While he has refused to campaign with Trump anymore, and even disinvited him to an event in Wisconsin, he s got an extraordinarily flimsy position on Trump now. He won t talk about Trump, and he seems to be urging people to just kind of forget about Trump s Twitter storms and other problems.No mention of Trump being a sexual predator, which is unbelievably hypocritical for someone as  Christian  as Paul Ryan. To be sure, Ryan never rescinded his endorsement of Trump, and apparently, that position has not changed. It s still sick.More Republicans are sure to follow as they decide their party is more important than actually standing for what s right. They are bloody pieces of feces-infused wimpiness for that, considering they keep trumpeting every type of  moral value  there is.Photo of Deb Fischer by Mark Wilson, photo of John Thune by Alex Wong, photo of Scott Garrett by Chip Somodevilla, Photo of Paul Ryan by Win McNamee, via Getty Images.

 JUST IN: Donald Trump Seriously Thinks Deaf People Are ‘Retarded’,"As if Donald Trump hasn t angered enough people already, he has now added the deaf to that long list.According to former staffers who worked on The Apprentice in 2011, the Republican nominee repeatedly questioned Academy Award-winning actress Marlee Matlin s mental capacity and referred to her as  retarded  just because she happens to be deaf.The staffers came forward to disclose Trump s treatment of Matlin anonymously due to non-disclosure agreements they had to sign.The staffers told the Daily Beast that Trump repeatedly insulted Matlin to her face and behind her back and  would often equate that she was mentally retarded. During the taping of the show, Trump would often scribble down notes while sitting at the table of  the boardroom the show s primary set. A person familiar with the notes who helped clean up after tapings said that on one of the pieces of paper, Trump wrote:  Marlee, is she retarded?? Apparently, Trump didn t care about being on a hot mic because one staffer heard Trump  make fun of her voice,  too.  It actually sounded a lot like what he did [to] the New York Times guy,  the staffer described.As you may recall, a writer for the New York Times named Serge F. Kovaleski criticized Trump in an article. Trump then responded by openly mocking Kovaleski s disability on the campaign trail.Here s a video of the disgraceful incident via YouTube.For the record, being deaf means Matlin can t hear sounds. It doesn t mean she is mentally impaired. But Trump clearly either doesn t know the difference or does not care.But reportedly, Matlin didn t let Trump get away with insulting her. During a segment filmed in the  boardroom,  Matlin stood up for herself after Trump made insensitive remarks about her and treated her as if she had a mental handicap.Of course, that footage did not air as part of the episode and none of Trump s insults were aired during the season, probably because his behavior towards Matlin would have caused national outrage.And it should definitely cause national outrage now.Donald Trump has a history of insulting people with mental and physical disabilities, and this is unacceptable.Trump should publicly apologize to Matlin for how he treated her and he should definitely drop his bid for the presidency. America deserves a president who won t look down upon people just because they have a disability. Disabled people are not inferior. Donald Trump deserves nothing more than to be a disgraceful footnote in the dustbin of history.Donald Trump deserves nothing more than to be a disgraceful footnote in the dustbin of history.Featured Image: Sara D.

 WATCH: Jake Tapper CRUSHES Trump Cheerleader For Hypocrisy On Sexual Assault Accusations,"Donald Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany was taken to the woodshed on Thursday by CNN s Jake Tapper.CNN has been asking Trump surrogates why they are portraying women accusing the Republican nominee of sexual assault as liars but are so adamant that Bill Clinton s accusers are telling the truth.Jeffrey Lord stammered and did a death spiral when Anderson Cooper questioned that hypocrisy earlier in the day. So CNN host Jake Tapper posed the same question to McEnany and she crashed and burned.McEnany began by declaring that every woman who makes a sexual assault allegation should be heard, only to then attack Trump s accusers.  There are a lot of reasons, the facts that lead us to question these accusations,  she said. She went on to question the New York Times story by claiming that the same authors of that story published a story in May in which their source recanted and she questioned them because they allegedly never filed a police report against Trump.That s when Tapper hammered McEnany by pointing out her hypocrisy and the fact that Clinton accuser Juanita Broaddrick signed an affidavit denying that she was raped by the former president and reminded her that another of Clinton s accusers did not report their allegations to police before making a public accusation.In other words, the Trump campaign has a double standard when it comes to sexual assault accusations. Kayleigh, I have to say, because we had a conversation on Sunday during the debate after Mr. Trump brought out the three women who have accused Bill Clinton, two of them of sexual assault and one of them of rape. And you didn t go into detail questioning their accounts. One of them signed an affidavit saying that there had not been any nonconsensual sex and then recanted it. You didn t have a problem with that inconsistency. One of them didn t report the alleged incidents to police. You didn t have an incident that. My question is why do you have a different standard for Mr. Trump s accusers than you do for Mr. Clinton s accusers? Tapper later went on to correct McEnany that  sexual assault is not sex  after she said she isn t  here to litigate  Donald Trump s sexual past.Here s the video via YouTube.This is the question every Trump supporter should be asked. Because Trump and his campaign are insisting that Bill Clinton s accusers are telling the truth while demonizing women who come forward with sexual assault accusations against Trump. If they truly believe every woman should be heard, then they have to admit that Trump s accusers could be telling the truth, too.Also, Bill Clinton is NOT running for president. Donald Trump, however, IS.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Meet The Black Man Donald Trump Tried To Murder (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has often campaigned as the self-described  law and order  candidate in the 2016 presidential election. But one of the men Trump tried to persecute is speaking out against the reality TV star.As recently as last week, Trump argued that the Central Park Five should be behind bars. The men were five young black men who were railroaded by the criminal justice system and falsely accused of raping a white woman (known as the Central Park Jogger). Eventually, after they were imprisoned, another man was connected to the crime via DNA evidence and the Five were released. They received a court judgment and were rewarded monetary damages for their unjust incarceration.Trump took out a full-page ad during the trial, calling for the boys  execution. Now, one of those men, Yusef Salaam, is speaking out about Trump and his incitement and what Salaam describes as  calling basically for us to be murdered. Yusef Salaam said Donald Trump s infamous full-page ad calling for the deaths of the Central Park Five would in an earlier era been the impetus that sparked  mob justice    in a new ad against Trump. They had our names, our phone numbers and addresses in the papers so what would ve happened? Somebody from the darkest places of society would ve come to our homes, kicked in our doors, and drug us from our homes and hung us from the trees in Central Park. That would ve been the type of mob justice that they were seeking. Trump still refuses to accept that these men are innocent, part of a troubling pattern from the Republican nominee in a blas  attitude towards black concerns and safety. Asked during the debates about police brutality against blacks and the protests of the Black Lives Matter movement, Trump has instead gone at length about  stop and frisk  and inner city crime. It is his go-to position and rhetoric when speaking about black people.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Deplorables Just Got Flat-Out MONSTROUS With Sexual Assault Victims On Twitter (TWEETS),"One of Twitter s top trending hashtags is full of women who ve been harassed and assaulted, and they re explaining why women don t report such incidents with their personal stories. There are many, many moving accounts under #WhyWomenDontReport, but there are also the misogynistic jerkwads who are intentionally hurting victims all over again.Trump s deplorables are busy reinforcing their image as the bottom-feeders of deplorability. They re calling Trump s victims liars, and they re calling women who report sexual assault liars, gold-diggers, and worse. In short, they re doing every single thing they can to shame women who have been harassed and outright attacked. Some are even using #NextFakeTrumpVictim as a rebuttal to #WhyWomenDontReport.They are disgusting, and they are monsters.

Many fear that nobody will believe them. They fear the accusation will be turned back on them and destroy their reputations and lives. They can t stomach the idea of having to answer explicit questions about their bodies and their sexuality in order to prove they were actually attacked.It s because there are police who tell women to deal with it, and sometimes don t even file the report. It s because women are asked what they were wearing, whether they were drinking and flirting, why they were wherever they were, why they let themselves be alone with their attackers, and so forth. It s because people say that sexual assault is just sex that the victim regrets later on.No, people don t believe us. Yes, people shame us to hell and back. Yes, we re accused of ruining the lives of the men who hurt us so badly. Why don t women report sexual assault and harassment? Because we can t.Featured image by Ralph Freso via Getty Images",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 REPORT: The Vast Majority Of Trump’s Employees Hope He Loses In November,"To hear Donald Trump tell it, he s the best, hugest, biggest boss there has ever been and the way he runs his businesses (if you ignore the multiple bankruptcies and closures) means the people who work for him should be overwhelmingly proud to be under his leadership.But Reuters has done some number-crunching on what kind of financial support the people who work in his businesses have shown to his presidential campaign, and as he would say, it s very  sad! Only a dozen of an estimated 22,450 people employed at Trump s companies have donated more than $200 to the celebrity businessman s bid for the U.S. presidency, a Reuters review of federal campaign finance records through August shows. Those who gave less to either Trump s campaign or his joint fundraising committees would not have shown up in the review.The contributors, including an office cleaner, a golf course groundskeeper, a bartender and an attorney, have given $5,298 to Trump s campaign, a fraction of the $112 million Trump s political operation has received from donors and joint fundraisers.The news service also points out that an employee at the Trump companies even has donated to Secretary Hillary Clinton, his electoral rival and the current front-runner in the presidential contest.By comparison, in 2012 people who had worked alongside Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had donated $1.4 million both directly to his campaign and to the super PAC supporting his campaign.Secretary Clinton has also received donations from employees at the U.S. State Department, which she headed from 2009 to 2013.Trump has continually lagged behind Clinton in fundraising during the election, a disparity which has shown up in underfunded campaign operations in many of the key swing states and a severe lack of television advertising. Trump claimed he would self-fund his campaign, but while he has donated to the enterprise, it hasn t been a significant fraction of the  billions  Trump claims to possess, a figure which cannot be independently verified because Trump won t release his tax returns.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump FRANTICALLY Spins Illuminati-Like Global Conspiracy Theory To Explain His Death Spiral,"Since disgusting revelations came to light that show the Republicans  horse crap-covered, diseased nutsack of a nominee is actually a sexual predator, Trump has been frantically trying to cover his ass in every way imaginable. There is no line he will not cross, no level to which he will not sink, in order to turn the whole thing around in a pathetic attempt to come out smelling like roses. That includes pushing ever-wilder conspiracy theories about how the nefarious Hillary Clinton is behind all of this.Yes, Trump wants people to believe that this is all a worldwide smear campaign specifically intended to derail his candidacy. His asinine cease-and-desist letter to The New York Times revealed that (along with the true intent of the lawsuit threat), and so do the growing, nutty conspiracy theories he was touting in West Palm Beach today: The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media: the press. Let s be clear on one thing, the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They re a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or any other financial entity with a total political agenda and the agenda is not for you, it s for themselves.Their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any costs, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy. For them, it s a war. And for them, nothing at all is out of bounds. This is a struggle for the survival of our nation. Believe me. And this will be our last chance to save it. Oh, it s a war all right, but it s a war against the evil that pervades Trump and his loyal, minion-y followers. Nobody s destroyed Trump s life but Trump himself. When it comes to the women he s assaulted   he s out to destroy their lives, and the lives of members of the press, for daring to report the truth about him. He is so not a victim.Trump s followers are dead certain that this election will be stolen from them, and Trump is playing that like a master violinist. For Trump, it s simple: The election is stolen if he loses. The election is fair if he wins. End of story.His minionish cult of followers see it the exact same way.But wait! It gets better. He also drew connections between his assault victims coming forward, Wikileaks, and Hillary: These claims are all fabricated, they are pure fiction, and they are outright lies It s not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment and all together at the same time as Wikileaks releases documents exposing the massive international corruption of the Clinton machine. Coincidence or not, nothing changes the fact that he s a sexual predator who has no business being anywhere near a position of such power and responsibility as the presidency.As he continued to speak, his descent into madness became clearer: We ve seen this [corruption] first hand in the Wikileaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends, and her donors. The funny thing is that those emails reveal nothing of the sort. Time pointed out that a lot of things he said there are  invented.  As The Atlantic put it, they show a political candidate being political. Is that good? Not necessarily. However, they don t reveal anything nearly as horrific as what s come out about Trump recently.It s time for the cowardly GOP to actually come forward as a unified party and do something about this man. He s beyond help at this point.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservatives VICIOUSLY Attack Michelle Obama For Condemning Trump’s Predatory Behavior,"Donald Trump s army of deplorables are viciously attacking First Lady Michelle Obama because she dared to condemn his predatory sexual behavior towards women.On Thursday, Mrs. Obama took a powerful swing at the Republican nominee over his comments about sexually assaulting women and his predatory behavior that makes him totally unfit to be president. This is not something we can ignore,  she said.  It s not something we can sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season.Because this was not just a lewd conversation. This wasn t locker room banter. This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior. And actually bragging about kissing and groping women. Using language so obscene that many of us are worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV. To make matters worse, it now seems very clear this isn t an isolated incident. It s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life.The First Lady also urged parents to reject Trump because rewarding him with the presidency will only send a bad message to children, especially boys. In our hearts we all know that if we let Hillary s opponent win the election, then we are sending a clear message to our kids that everything they re seeing and hearing is perfectly okay. We are validating it, we are endorsing it. We are telling our sons that it is okay to humiliate women, telling our daughters that this is how we deserve to be treated, that bigotry and bullying are perfectly acceptable. Is that we want for our children? Let s be very clear, strong men, men who are truly role models don t need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful. Michelle Obama is no stranger at being attacked for any little thing she does and this time was no different as conservatives swarmed the internet to smear her as much as possible with all sorts of horrendous remarks.@CNNPolitics @CNN too bad her husband isn t a decent man.

 REPORT: Trump Blocked HIS OWN CAMPAIGN From Vetting His Past,"When one becomes any sort of public figure   especially a political public figure   one s past is often scrutinized. Therefore, it is pretty much standard practice for potential campaign officials to vet the potential candidate prior to launching any sort of run for public office. However, when GOP nominee Donald Trump s original campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, sought to do this, Trump himself pulled the plug on any such endeavor.According to Bloomberg Politics, Lewandowski requested that Trump s past be looked into before he even filed to run for president. However, Trump refused, which means that his campaign officials have been caught completely off guard by things like the lewd tape from the Access Hollywood bus, as well as by the subsequent allegations that he groped multiple women without their consent over the years. Apparently, the same thing happened with Trump s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Allegedly, Manafort wanted to vet Trump just like Lewandowski did, but was rebuffed. As a result of this, the only things Lewandowski was prepared to combat were Trump s monetary contributions to Democratic causes and politicians, and his Iraq war comments. All the rest was off limits.This is exceedingly odd, considering that any information found on the part of Team Trump would be used to prepare for any backlash relating to things that might come out from the candidate s past, as has happened in the last week and a half or so. Such secrecy would lead one to believe that there is something out there so bad that Trump feared people bailing on his then-fledgling campaign if they should find out about it.As for Trump s current spin master campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway? Well, she s just as in the dark as her predecessors were. She went on Fox News on Thursday and said of the dumping of information on Trump s past: I don t know what s out there. There s no way to know what is and isn t out there. Ohhh, Kellyanne. Dear, dear Kellyanne. You might not know exactly what else is out there, but you seem to be an intelligent pollster/GOP operative. You can figure it out. And, as a woman and as a mother, you should be ashamed of yourself for continuing to deflect and defend a man whose past includes such behavior.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Top Trump Surrogate BRUTALLY Stabs Him In The Back: ‘He’s Pathetic’ (VIDEO),"It s looking as though Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is losing support even from within his own ranks. You know things are getting bad when even your top surrogates start turning against you, which is exactly what just happened on Fox News when Newt Gingrich called Trump  pathetic. Gingrich knows that Trump needs to keep his focus on Hillary Clinton if he even remotely wants to have a chance at defeating her. However, Trump has hurt feelings because many Republicans don t support his sexual assault against women have turned against him, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI). So, that has made Trump lash out as his own party.Gingrich said on Fox News: Look, first of all, let me just say about Trump, who I admire and I ve tried to help as much as I can. There s a big Trump and a little Trump. The little Trump is frankly pathetic. I mean, he s mad over not getting a phone call? Trump s referring to the fact that Paul Ryan didn t call to congratulate him after the debate. Probably because he didn t win despite what Trump s ego tells him.Gingrich also added: Donald Trump has one opponent. Her name is Hillary Clinton. Her name is not Paul Ryan. It s not anybody else. Trump doesn t seem to realize that the person he should be mad at is himself because he truly is his own worst enemy. This will ultimately lead to his defeat and he will have no one to blame but himself.Watch here via Politico:Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 BREAKING: Michelle Obama HAMMERS Trump’s Behavior Towards Women In Tearful Condemnation,"While holding back tears in Manchester, New Hampshire on Thursday, First Lady Michelle Obama addressed the sexual assault bombshells that have been raining down upon the Republican nominee for nearly a week now.Mrs. Obama has mostly tried to refrain from commenting on Trump s sexual misconduct towards and remarks about women, but she felt she could no longer hold back. She roundly condemned Trump and explained how his remarks make him totally unfit to be president. The fact is that in this election, we have a candidate for President of the United States who, over the course of his lifetime and the course of this campaign has said things about women that are so shocking, so demeaning, I simply will not repeat anything here today. And last week, we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women. And I can t believe that I m saying that. A candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women, and I have to tell you that I can t stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn t have predicted,  she continued, telling the audience that she can t  pretend  that everything is normal because it would be  dishonest and disingenuous for me to move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream. This is not something we can ignore. It s not something we can sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season. Because this was not just a lewd conversation. This wasn t locker room banter. This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior. And actually bragging about kissing and groping women. Using language so obscene that many of us are worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV. To make matters worse, it now seems very clear this isn t an isolated incident. It s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life.And  have to tell you that I listened to all this. And I feel it so personally. And I m sure that many of you do too, particularly the women. The shameful comments about our bodies. The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect. The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman. It is cruel. It is frightening. And the truth is, it hurts. It hurts. Unlike many Republicans who think otherwise, Michelle Obama made it clear that Trump is NOT a role model for children and urged parents to protect their kids by voting against Trump on Election Day. In our hearts we all know that if we let Hillary s opponent win the election, then we are sending a clear message to our kids that everything they re seeing and hearing is perfectly okay. We are validating it, we are endorsing it. We are telling our sons that it is okay to humiliate women, telling our daughters that this is how we deserve to be treated, that bigotry and bullying are perfectly acceptable. Is that we want for our children? Let s be very clear, strong men, men who are truly role models don t need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful. Here s the full speech via YouTube.Donald Trump is a disgrace to this country and our values. And it looks like only the American people can stop him, because Republicans are too cowardly to strip Trump of the nomination and admit that they were wrong to make him the leader of their party. This national nightmare needs to be put to an end once and for all and the only way to do that is to defeat Trump by a landslide in November.Featured Image via screenshot",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Pennsylvania Church Demonstrates How To Deal With A Child-Molesting Pastor,"While many churches defend pastors who have raped or molested children in their congregations, a church in Pennsylvania is showing them what doing the right thing looks like.35-year-old youth pastor Wesley Ryan Blackburn is currently in jail waiting to be tried on  84 felony counts of statutory sexual assault, 84 misdemeanor counts of indecent assault and one felony count of corruption of minors,  according to The Tribune-Democrat.Blackburn worked at Faith Brethren Bible Church in New Paris until last week when he admitted to his wife and state troopers that he impregnated a 15-year-old girl who was a member of the youth group he was teaching.The so-called  man of God  admitted his crimes to his wife after she confronted him about his misconduct. He then told her he didn t love her anymore and demanded a divorce.Blackburn s wife immediately called pastor James Espenshade and told him about her husband s misconduct with the teen girl.But unlike other churches that have stood by pastors who commit sex crimes, the Faith Brethren Bible Church did the right thing and straight up fired Blackburn and called the police. We didn t even care what he had to say,  Espenshade told WAJC.  We don t tolerate this kind of stuff   it s inappropriate, it s reprehensible. There was never a discussion of anything else. We had to do what was right. Police questioned Blackburn while he was packing up his office and he was arrested and charged.The way this church handled Blackburn stands in sharp contrast to the way Columbia Road Baptist Church in North Olmsted, Ohio handled a similar situation.When youth pastor Brian Mitchell, a married man with three kids, was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for raping a teen girl, the church not only didn t fire him after discovering inappropriate texts he had been sending her, they continued to stand by him even after he went to prison by blaming the victim and demanding that she apologize to Mitchell s wife.Like Mitchell, Blackburn will probably receive a similar sentence. But Faith Brethren Bible Church deserves praise for calling the police upon learning of Blackburn s misconduct and for immediately terminating his employment. They also deserve praise for not blaming the teenage victim for Blackburn s actions. This is the way churches should handle these situations, but sadly, far too many of them do not.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Watch Joe Biden Tells Us EXACTLY What Trump Is, BRILLIANTLY Rips Him From End To End (VIDEO)","With more and more coming out about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, it s become abundantly clear that he in no way should be allowed near the Oval Office.Between his racism, sexism, Islamophobia, insulting disabled people as well as Gold Star families, and now the leaked Access Hollywood footage which is leading to women everywhere to reveal they ve been sexually assaulted by Trump, he s not fit to lead anything.Appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers Vice President Joe Biden laid it all out on the table and told Seth, as well as the world, why Donald Trump isn t fit to lead as well as how absolutely horrible he is to women.Biden said: First of all, what I found astounding, is that he would so publicly, no matter who he was talking to, that he would acknowledge that he engaged in the textbook definition of sexual assault. He didn t say, you know,  I go up and I ask if, I just go up and grab and I can do this    and then I see in the paper today, one of the pageants, I guess Miss Teen America, the teen girls, I guess three, four, five in a room, they were getting dressed, they were naked, he walked in and said  don t worry girls, I ve seen all this    he stood there. I mean, this is absolutely outrageous behavior. Biden then drives the point home: I ve spent most of my career trying to figure out how to begin to change the culture in this country   that we treat women with respect and with dignity. And Biden truly has with his  It s On Us campaign which is leading the effort to combat sexual assault nationwide.What Donald Trump has done to women isn t only outrageous, it s illegal. Unwanted sexual advances is the definition of sexual assault, and Trump needs to be held accountable for his actions.Watch the video here: He engaged in the textbook definition of sexual assault   A stunned Joe Biden on the Trump tape: pic.twitter.com/O9u6rP3AsH  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) October 13, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump TERRIFIED Of Losing, Now He’s Even Running Away From Sean Hannity (DETAILS)","On Thursday morning, Donald Trump did the unthinkable: he canceled an interview with one of his biggest cheerleaders, Sean Hannity. Trump had been scheduled to appear on the Fox host s show Thursday night, but a spokeswoman for the network says The Donald will not be showing up.This announcement comes in the wake of  Pussygate    Trump s mid-90 s admission that he loves that he can get away with grabbing women  by the pussy  because he s rich   as well as revelations that he barged into dressing rooms to creep on models (some as young as 15 years old), his admission that he thought Paris Hilton was hot when she was 12, audio of him hitting on a 10-year-old surfacing, and his upcoming child rape case.Apparently Mr. Trump doesn t think even Sean Hannity   a joke of a man who has done nothing but pitch underhand to Trump the entire election season  can find kid gloves to fit this situation.Things are not looking good for Trump lately, with his poll numbers in a nosedive since everyone learned about his  special handshake.  While it is gratifying to see the Republican Party and even some of Trump s formerly vocal supporters running away from him, it is frightening that it is only happening now. The GOP is fine with Islamophobia, racism, his open courting of white supremacists, his constant attack on women because of their looks and weight, his desire to build a wall to keep brown people out of the country, Muslim concentration camps, his incessant remarks about banging his daughter, the child rape allegations, and his love of well-done steaks.

 WATCH: Anderson Cooper Leaves Trump Supporter DUMBFOUNDED For Hypocrisy On Sexual Assault,"Trump mouthpiece Jeffrey Lord got his a** handed to him by Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night for once again bringing up Juanita Broaddrick in response to sexual assault allegations against the Republican nominee.During the segment, Cooper and the panel were discussing the women who have come forward to tell their stories about how Donald Trump groped them when Lord interrupted to complain that the women didn t talk about Jaunita Broaddrick and her accusations against Bill Clinton, even though Broaddrick has nothing to do with Trump s own behavior.Lord called the women s accusations into question, but Cooper was quick to drop the hammer on his hypocrisy. Why do you believe Juanita Broaddrick and not these two women,  Cooper asked, leaving a dumbfounded Lord to claim that the media isn t giving Clinton s accusers an  equal forum. But Clinton s accusers have no bearing on this election because Bill Clinton is not running for president, as other panelists reminded Lord. Furthermore, Bill Clinton was never charged with committing any crimes. Juanita Broaddrick filed a sworn affidavit stating that the rape allegations against Clinton are untrue. And these accusations against Clinton are 20 years old and have received a ton of media coverage over the years, especially during Clinton s presidency. The allegations against Trump, meanwhile, are new and haven t received near as much coverage.But Lord whined that the New York Times hasn t interviewed Broaddrick and then brought up a ridiculous anecdotal claim about meeting a couple from Virginia who supposedly think the media the treating Trump unfairly.When it became clear that Lord and Trump s other surrogates were not going to win this fight they resorted to calling Hillary Clinton an  enabler  of Bill Clinton behavior who supposedly bullied the women accusing Bill of sexual misconduct.But the other panelists would have none of it and proceeded to smack them down.Here s the video via YouTube:[ad3media campaign= 1136 ]The accusations against Bill Clinton have nothing to do with this election. Hillary Clinton is running for president, not her husband. Trump, on the other hand, IS running for president and the allegations against him are new and should be covered by the media.Donald Trump is unfit to be president and the fact that his supporters have to resort to bringing up Bill Clinton and his accusers in a lame effort to distract from that proves it.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Former Trump Exec Drops Bombshell About Why He Should Never Be President (VIDEO),"As droves of women come forward to tell of the horrifying sexual, predatory attacks they ve endured at the hands of Republican nominee Donald Trump, another testimony is making headlines   and it comes from a longtime Trump Organization executive.Barbara Res worked for Trump for 18 years as an executive vice president and senior vice president, and became well-known because Trump would often mention her whenever he was accused of being a misogynist. As expected, her recollection of Trump says otherwise.In an interview on CNN, Res told Alisyn Camerota that she was not only supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but gave Americans a brutal lesson about why  supreme sexist  Trump should not be allowed anywhere near the White House. Res was brutal in her criticism, and every word she spoke was true. She held nothing back as she trashed her former boss: First of all, everyone knows he has no experience. I mean, the idea that he would be president is just ridiculous. I have other developers I worked for who were just as smart or smarter than he was, and I wouldn t vote for them for president, either. Res argued that all presidential candidates before Trump have at least some grasp of how government and the world works, as well as some experience under their belt. Res says this is the exact opposite of what has happened with Trump: The way he shows himself, he doesn t seem to know basic civics. Then, she drops a major truth bomb on voters, telling them the terrifying things she s learned about Trump while working for him. She said: The worst thing about Trump, and the reason not to vote for him for president, is his temperament. He flies off the handle, he attacks viciously   it s like shooting someone and having a nuclear bomb come back at you. He s vindictive, and he s dishonest.He always was dishonest, all the time I worked with him. We never knew when he was telling the truth or when he wasn t   and I don t think that that s what we need in a president. You can listen to Res warn America about Trump below:Former Trump executive: The worst thing about Trump, and the reason not to vote for him, is his temperament. https://t.co/kCwtELmC3c  New Day (@NewDay) October 13, 2016In another interview, Res has tackled the recent evidence that Trump is a misogynist. Res addressed the leaked audio tape where Trump made lewd comments about sexually assaulting women and told Olivia Nuzzi of The Daily Beast: I had never heard him say  p*ssy  before. I heard him say  f*ck  a million times. The way he said it I just grab it I was shocked at that, and then you know, when I took the time to put it into context, I said, yeah, that s right. He s terribly sexist. He s a womanizer for sure. He hired me for a specific reason: Because I was really good. And he told me, and he believed this, that women had to work harder and be smarter and were willing to work harder than men, and that s what he wanted, and he had a couple of women working for him   Men are better than women,  he said,  but a good woman is better than 10 men.  I think he thought I would take it as a compliment, and I think it was intended as a compliment. Res  words couldn t have come at a better time. The truth about Trump is starting to become louder, and we hope America is listening.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Liberty University Students SHRED Jerry Falwell Jr: Trump ‘Does Not Have Our Support’,"Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. still supports Donald Trump even after the recently released video showing the reality show star turned GOP presidential nominee bragging about sexually assaulting women. However, students at the evangelical university aren t following Falwell in lockstep.A strongly worded statement was issued Wednesday by the group Liberty United Against Trump which denounces Falwell for his continued support of the Republican candidate on the heels of Trump s lewd and predatory remarks about women in the 1995 video, according to The Washington Post. We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history,  the statement reads.  Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.   He has made his name by maligning others and bragging about his sins. Not only is Donald Trump a bad candidate for president, he is actively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose. Jesus said  Judge not, lest ye be judged.  Falwell wrote in an op-ed for The Post in January.  Let s stop trying to choose the political leaders who we believe are the most godly because, in reality, only God knows people s hearts. You and I don t, and we are all sinners. Students at the university felt compelled to respond to Falwell s unwavering support for Trump. Because our president has led the world to believe that Liberty University supports Donald Trump, we students must take it upon ourselves to make clear that Donald Trump is absolutely opposed to what we believe, and does not have our support,  the students said.  We are not proclaiming our opposition to Donald Trump out of bitterness, but out of a desire to regain the integrity of our school. Falwell criticized the students opposing his support for Trump, writing in part,  This student statement seems to ignore the teachings of Jesus not to judge others but they are young and still learning. The students disagree.  Jesus tells a story in the Bible about a man who tries to remove a speck of dust from his brother s eye, while he has a log stuck in his own,  the statement reads.  You hypocrite,  Jesus says,  first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother s eye. Dustin Wahl, a junior at Liberty, told the paper that more than 250 students, alumni and faculty have left signatures of support to protest Falwell s endorsement of the GOP nominee. Since the most recent sexual assault thing, we realized this is a time we can all get behind this and say  enough is enough.  We do not support our president in his endorsement of Trump and we want the world to know because he s giving Liberty University a bad name,  Wahl told The Post.  It makes it seem like we re about populist politics when we re about the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is about gaining the integrity of our school. This is an effort to say Liberty is not Trump university. Falwell thinks Trump is a  changed man.  The problem with his mindset is that Trump has not changed since 1995. Since then, he s gone on to call women slobs, pigs, dogs and launched attacks on former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.You can read the full statement from the students here.Photo by Joe Raedle via Getty.

 ‘Big Bang Theory’ Actor Tears Trump To PIECES (TWEETS),"When Donald Trump boldly declared that he had been released from the  shackles  of the GOP (that was him shackled?)

It began with a one-word, yet oh-so-beautiful tweet:""shackles""  Wil SCREAMton (@wilw) October 11, 2016Then, of course, Wheaton moved on to the defining moment of Trump s campaign: the revelation that he spends a lot of time grabbing women by their p*ssies:Oh you're gonna grab America by the pussy? Or are you gonna punch it in the face? Or not pay any taxes to support it? Please, do tell. https://t.co/51Pn40hZpq  Wil SCREAMton (@wilw) October 11, 2016And his numerous, numerous bankruptcies:Oh wait!

 Trump Is Trying To MUZZLE His Sexual Assault Victims In The Most Ludicrous Way Imaginable,"Yesterday, The New York Times ran a story in which they gave moving accounts of two women who say that Donald Trump sexually assaulted them. Trump maintains that his boasts about being allowed to assault women because he s got star power were just words, and that he s never done such a thing. In a sorry attempt to maintain the illusion that he s a good person, Trump has had his lawyers send the Times an official cease-and-desist, claiming the story amounts to libel.The strange thing is that the bulk of this letter appears to be directed at the women that the Times spoke to than it is to the Times itself: [Y]ou apparently performed an entirely inadequate investigation to test the veracity of these false and malicious allegations, including why these two individuals waited, in one case, 11 years, and, in another case, more than three decades, before deciding to come forward with these false and defamatory statements. And there it is. Assassinating the characters of the victims by saying that, if they d really been assaulted sexually, they d have come forward right away, is a very typical ploy for those trying to defend themselves against such allegations. But there s still nothing in there about what, specifically, is false in the Times  story and how they know the Times knowingly published a false story.Trump s victims could all find their names and characters dragged through the mud because of this, and make no mistake, he will do that as loudly as he can. The fear of having that happen, and of not being believed, keeps many sexual assault victims from coming forward.And that could easily be why Trump is doing this. However, his method appears to be two-fold: In addition to intimidating and bullying his victims, he s also intimidating and bullying press outlets. The hope there would be that they won t give a voice to any more of his victims out of fear of getting sued.This isn t the only absurdity in the letter, but it is the most damning, given its possible intent. The letter also makes it political instead of naming specific falsehoods, which is outright ridiculous if this is a serious cease-and-desist: Your article is reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel per se. It is apparent from, among other things, the timing of the article, that it is nothing more than a politically-motivated effort to defeat Mr. Trump s candidacy Clearly, The New York Times is willing to provide a platform to anyone wishing to smear Mr. Trump s name and reputation prior to the election irrespective of whether the alleged statements have any basis in fact. Really? That s a hell of a thing to say in a cease-and-desist. The letter itself is politically motivated   it s actually quite difficult to believe that an actual lawyer wrote this baloney. Here s what a strong cease-and-desist letter should contain, and this is a template of a decent cease-and-desist. This idiocy meets none of the conditions it needs to.CNNMoney reports that Trump has also threatened the Palm Beach Post for publishing a separate story from yet another victim. Besides that, the Trump campaign told Times reporter Megan Twohey that he would sue if they published the story. She received her own letter yesterday afternoon and was called a  disgusting human being. A lawsuit against the Times would uncover everything and probably sink Trump entirely, because these allegations are the tip of the iceberg. He knows that. But, if nothing else, the discovery phase of this would be interesting.You can read the letter in full here:BREAKING: Trump demands retraction from @nytimes, threatens lawsuit.https://t.co/GBwomM7tgA pic.twitter.com/Htm9uaEsne  Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) October 13, 2016Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Assaults Writer Covering His Anniversary: ‘He Was Forcing His Tongue Down My Throat’,"Natasha Stoynoff, a writer who covered Donald Trump for People, just published a shocking account of sexual assault at the hands of the real estate mogul turned presidential contender.Her disturbing account was published by the same magazine who assigned her to the Trump beat ten years ago. Stoynoff writes that in 2005 she went to Trump s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to cover his one year anniversary with Melania. Our photo team shot the Trumps on the lush grounds of their Florida estate, and I interviewed them about how happy their first year of marriage had been. When we took a break for the then very-pregnant Melania to go upstairs and change wardrobe for more photos, Donald wanted to show me around the mansion. There was one  tremendous  room in particular, he said, that I just had to see. I just start kissing them,  he said to Billy Bush.  It s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don t even wait. And when you re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.' We walked into that room alone, and Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat. Stoynoff describes how the assault affected her and compares his actions during that closed-door encounter a decade ago to what he said on the bombshell tape from Access Hollywood that has rocked his campaign. He may have claimed at the debate that this was just  locker room talk  and he had never actually assaulted a woman in this way, but he did to Stoynoff exactly what he bragged about to Billy Bush, he  just started kissing her,  consent be damned. I m not sure what locker room talk consists of these days. I only know that I wasn t in a locker room when he pushed me against a wall. I was in his home, as a professional, and his beautiful pregnant wife was just upstairs,  Stoynoff concluded.  Talk is talk. But it wasn t just talk in my case, it was very much action. And, just for the record, Mr. Trump, I did not consent,  she added.At least three other women have come forward this week to say that they were sexually assaulted by Donald Trump. A tape of him leering at a 10-year-old girl and talking about how he would  be dating her in 10 years  has also surfaced.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",News,"October 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Close Trump Ally Just ADMITTED He Communicates With Wikileaks,"Trump s supporters, and some in the press, believe that if it wasn t for Trump being a disgusting sexual predator, Hillary Clinton would have been done when Wikileaks released a bunch of emails from her campaign. However, an aide to Hillary, John Podesta, has made an interesting connection, too. One of Trump s close allies, Roger Stone, communicates with Wikileaks.And Stone has just admitted to it. I do have a back-channel communication with Assange, because we have a good mutual friend,  Stone told CBS4 News [Miami] Wednesday evening.  That friend travels back and forth from the United States to London and we talk. I had dinner with him last Monday.' He claims he doesn t have direct communication with Assange, though, and he insists he has nothing to do with their email dump. Democrats and U.S. officials believe that Wikileaks might be working with Russia on this, which wouldn t be surprising since they hacked the DNC over the summer and are showing interest in trying to rig our election.Podesta has also accused Stone of having advance knowledge of what was going to be in Wikileaks  email dump   an accusation that Stone flatly denies: I have a back-channel communications with WikiLeaks,  Stone told NBC News.  But they certainly don t clear or tell me in advance what they re going to do.' What s the point of the communication, then? Given what Wikileaks is busy doing trying to expose Hillary as corrupt, which could tilt the election in Trump s favor it s not really all that difficult to imagine that this  back-channel communication  is actually collusion directly between Stone and Assange.In fact, back in August, Stone said he was in direct communication with Assange and that they were actively working to bring down Hillary s campaign. Speaking to the Southwest Broward Republican Organization, Stone referred directly to the so-called  October surprise,  saying, according to Mediaite: Well, it could be any number of things. I actually have communicated with Assange. I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there s no telling what the October surprise may be. Lately, it seems that everything anyone involved with Trump tries to do to bring Hillary and the Democrats down backfires. If Stone communicates with Wikileaks, that implicates the Trump campaign. He s admitted to back-channel communication. He has said he s spoken to Assange, although he denies it now. This won t look good for Trump s already faltering campaign.Featured image via Ben Jackson/Getty Images for SiriusXM",News,"October 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Anderson Cooper STUPEFIES Trump’s Campaign Manager With A Preschool Math Lesson,"Following a horribly disastrous weekend for Donald Trump, his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, seems to have found her feet again. She s back on the airwaves trying to tear down Hillary Clinton in her usual desperate attempts to deflect attention away from her lord and savior s terrible character. In doing so, she brought up Hillary s poll numbers with Anderson Cooper, and the conversation is just absurd:KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, I think Hillary Clinton s been depressing Democratic turnout. My goodness, why is this woman at 46 percent? She s like the magic 46. She s 46 percent in the new NBC News Wall Street Journal poll, she s 46 percent in a lot of the swing states  COOPER: She s ahead of your candidate, though.CONWAY: Pardon me? Well, Anderson, she s running as the first female president who has a sitting president and First Lady much more popular than she ll ever be. She s got a  COOPER: Your candidate is below 40 percent.CONWAY: Is that a question? You re asking me about  COOPER: Well, you re saying 46 percent is bad, but 37 percent is worse.CONWAY: You asked me about Hillary Clinton. You asked me if I thought   right, one need not be a pollster to know that.Pardon us while we clear our ears and rapidly blink our eyes to be sure we heard what we think we heard. How on earth does an experienced pollster like Conway bring up her deity s opponent s poll numbers as though they re terrible when Trump s are considerably worse? How does she not know how math works?How does a presidential campaign manager go on national television and make that much of a fool of herself?It s both hilarious and sad that Cooper had to give her a math lesson that s so basic pre-schoolers already know it. Watch below:Conway is actually a perfect match for Trump because she s just like him. She gives non-answers to questions, and when the conversation starts heading over towards facts, she gets upset, and even throws a fit if she can t turn it around. Case in point: Speaking on CNN again today, she tried to deflect, deflect, deflect by saying Trump bragging about sexual assault happened 10 to 15 years ago. Then, like a good little Trumpkin, she brought up Bill Clinton s affairs and accusations of sexual assault (which were never proven) which were even longer ago.And she called Trump a gentleman. Har de har har. Don t make us laugh too hard   it hurts.That she needed a math lesson in order to keep a conversation on track is laughable, at best. She might fancy herself a spin master, but the media s patience with her and her spin is wearing very thin.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"October 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rush Limbaugh: Lack Of Consent Is Just An Excuse Leftists Use To Vilify Rapists (AUDIO),"Nobody with any brains has ever accused Rush Limbaugh of understanding pretty much anything at all, but his latest bout with doltishness just went way over the line, even for him. While whining up a storm about decaying sexual morality in this country, he tried to paint the left as hypocrites because we tolerate anything sexual as long as there s consent. When there s no consent, we send out the rape police, and apparently, this is a problem.Have you ever heard anything so completely asinine in your life? What people do in their bedrooms is their business, but all bets are off when there s no consent. Sex must be consensual or it s rape. End of story. However, Limbaugh actually sees that as evidence of major hypocrisy when it comes to Trump s damning  hot mic  moment, where he admitted to sexually assaulting women. He said: You know what the magic word, the only thing that matters in American sexual mores today is? One thing. You can do anything, the left will promote and understand and tolerate anything, as long as there is one element. Do you know what it is? Consent. If there is consent on both or all three or all four, however many are involved in the sex act, it s perfectly fine. Whatever it is. But if the left ever senses and smells that there s no consent in part of the equation then here come the rape police. But consent is the magic key to the left. Listen to this vile, pathetic, diseased beer turd of a man below, because holy shit:Of course, this is also the man that said we would legalize rape if we could because we d just call it the Civil Rights Act of 2016. That s kind of odd, though, considering Limbaugh is now jumping on us for sending out  the rape police  whenever we see instances of rape.When he brought this up, he was discussing bathroom bills intended to keep transgender people out of the bathrooms that correspond with their identities: Now [civil rights] is being expanded. Civil rights, gay marriage; civil rights, transgender bathroom rights; civil rights, whatever the left wants. Except over here, rape has become a safety issue. Sexual assault is a safety issue, but only when we re talking about people that Limbaugh and his loyal fans hate. It s  just words  when Donald Trump brags about actually doing it.Put another way, these people are terrified of sexual predators posing as transgender people and invading women s public restrooms, despite the fact that there s no evidence this happens. However, their lord and savior, Donald Trump, can brag about actually assaulting women and he s  just saying words.  No concern for the safety of women who encounter him at all.Hypocrisy? Nobody s being hypocritical except the Trump-supporting right. And if Limbaugh can t understand what consent is, and how lack of consent literally means sexual assault and rape, then it s going to take an iron crowbar to beat it into his brain.Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News,"October 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SICKENING: Donald Trump Actually Hit On A 10-Year-Old Girl (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a sexual predator, and more and more evidence of that fact keeps surfacing. It seems that the hot mic tape of the lewd conversation between Trump and then-Access Hollywood host Billy Bush was just the tip of the iceberg. There have also been women who have come forward to say that Trump groped them inappropriately, and now there is video footage of Trump literally making sexually suggestive remarks about a 10-year-old girl. This occurred at a Christmas event in Trump Tower years ago, in 1992, when Trump was 46 years old. During the event, aired on Entertainment Tonight, Trump inquired of the little girl if she was  going up the escalator.  He then said, unabashedly and live on air: I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it? This is just beyond creepy. Donald Trump needs to be investigated. We have a sexual predator as a major party presidential nominee, and nothing is being done about his behavior by the authorities. Granted, we do have statues of limitations and all of that, but this is just insane. This more than  locker room talk,  as Trump put it at the second presidential debate. No, this is predatory behavior, and it is becoming more and more apparent that Trump regularly engages in inappropriate behavior   even with pre-pubescent children. If the GOP doesn t disavow Trump after this, the entire nation will know that they tolerate literal pedophilia in their ranks. Watch the disturbing comments below:Here's Trump, then 46 yrs old, saying in 1992 that ""I'm going to be dating her in 10 years"" while referring to a young girl.

 Teen BRUTALLY Hits Back At Trump And His Sexual-Assault Supporting Fans With Epic T-Shirt,"Trump rallies are not for the meek. They re for the racist, misogynistic violent dregs of society   and they re for the super brave who oppose them and who may well get beaten up for having the gall to attend. 18-year old Anna Lehane took a chance, though, and attended an Oct. 10 rally while wearing a deliberately inflammatory t-shirt.It didn t say  Black Lives Matter,  which is what both of her friends wore. Her shirt read this: Grab my pussy. I dare you. Now that Trump rally is over, here is picture of this bold young protester s message pic.twitter.com/ZCnCHWTqBQ  Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) October 11, 2016That is a bold message, particularly for a young woman at a Trump rally. She told The Huffington Post: I made the shirt as a protest to people in the public spotlight on such a global platform making such disrespectful, degrading and misogynistic comments and still being taken seriously. It s patently disgusting that Trump is even still in the running for President, and still has the following he does, after we learned that he brags about sexually harassing and assaulting women. It s exposed a fundamental and sickening flaw in right-wing culture in the U.S.Some are questioning the foolhardiness of such a t-shirt. If Lehane had gotten grabbed, no doubt many would blame her for inviting it with that t-shirt. And she did get a lot of lewd comments about it from what she called  creepy old men  at the rally.Then there s this guy, on Twitter, who basically said something similar to what a lot of white people say about black people protesting police brutality   there s a time, a place and an appropriate way to make a statement. That comes from discomfort with the message, and is intended to silence. Nonetheless:@tripgabriel @MarkRosner3 That isn t brave. It s vulgar and stupid.  Jason M.

Many of us have come forward with our own, painful stories of harassment and assault something we shouldn t have to do to be heard and still gotten slapped down as though we don t matter.

" Trump EXPLODES Because Paul Ryan Won’t Defend Him, Launches INSANE Attack (VIDEO)","Donald Trump has been having a meltdown like nothing we ve ever seen in politics. Ever since top Republicans have distanced themselves from him over his lewd remarks about grabbing women  by their p*ssy , Trump can barely control his outbursts. He s not only going after Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, he s even attacking his own party now!At the top of Trump s sh*t list is House Speaker Paul Ryan, who finally found his conscience and was so disgusted with Trump s misogynistic comments that he has stopped campaigning for Trump altogether, opting to focus down-ballot instead.Unable to admit that sexually assaulting women is wrong, Trump is taking out all his anger on Ryan and trashing him every chance he gets. At his rally in Florida on Wednesday, Trump threw Ryan under the bus and accused him of being part of a  sinister deal  to help Clinton get into the White House.Shouting until he got red in the face, Trump shared his latest insane conspiracy theory with his supporters, who soaked up every word of it. Trump yelled: You think that they would say,  Great going, Don, let s go. Let s beat this crook. She s a crook. Let s beat her. We got to stop her.  He doesn t do that.  A little later in the rally, Trump continued to say   There s a whole sinister deal going on  between Ryan and Clinton. You can watch this ridiculous footage below:[ad3media campaign= 1123 ]This recent attack on Ryan comes after an epic tweetstorm that Trump launched against the GOP, slamming his own party and Ryan for being appalled about his disrespectful comments about women. While it s about time that Ryan stopped helping and defending Trump, the House Speaker still hasn t pulled his endorsement. Perhaps after Trump attacks him a few more times, Ryan will be done with Trump for good.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"October 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Eric Trump Sent Fundraising Email Showing Trump Winning–There’s Just One Problem,"The Donald Trump presidential campaign is in trouble. He s behind in the polls, by as much as double digits, and many of his donors are asking for their money back. It s crisis time, so naturally, they are asking for more money. Trump s middle son Eric signed his name to the latest fundraising campaign, and it includes a map showing Trump winning by a landslide with this message: As one of the most dedicated grassroots leaders in the country you know, momentum matters,  the email, sent on behalf of the Trump campaign, reads.  And right now all the momentum is on our side. We re making huge gains against Crooked Hillary that you can see for yourself. There s just one problem.The map comes from FiveThirtyEight.com s Nate Silver. Nate rarely screws up, so why does this map show Trump winning nearly every state?Because that map is a part of a little experiment. It doesn t show momentum, as the Trump campaign is trying to tell us. It is a map of how the election would look if only men voted. While that might be a dream of the Trump camp, more than half the electorate are women.

 LeBron James Has Some CHOICE Words For Trump’s ‘Locker Room Talk’ And It’s BRUTAL (VIDEO),"Ever since the leaked tape of Donald Trump s hot mic before appearing on Access Hollywood revealing he has sexually assaulted women, many have been weighing in on what the candidate is calling  locker room talk. Trump apparently thinks that it is perfectly fine to talk about being sexually aggressive towards women without their consent, and also apparently thinks that this is what men talk about in locker rooms.Well, one man who spends a lot of time in locker rooms is speaking up and calling out Trump, and that person is none other than the legendary NBA champ LeBron James.James told reporters what actually goes on in locker rooms, which usually has a lot to do with what happened during the game. He also said: That s not locker room talk. That s trash talk. Emphasizing the fact that he has many women in his life, as well as children, and wouldn t want that sort of talk around them, nor does he think it is okay.Good on James for speaking out against Trump and his crude and horrific talk. Hopefully, this becomes a trend, and more and more athletes take a stand against the reality television host.Trump shouldn t be allowed near women, let alone the Oval Office. Remember to vote BLUE this November 8th.Watch the video here:LeBron weighs in on Donald Trump:  That s not locker room talk. That s trash talk.

 Giuliani Gets Caught Lying About Not Seeing Hillary In NYC In Response To 9/11,"If Rudy Giuliani is going to continue bringing up 9/11, he should at least have the common decency to not lie about what happened that day and in the aftermath.After all, thousands of pictures were taken that day and in the days after in addition to hundreds of videos. So one would think Giuliani would know better than to blatantly lie.But that s exactly what he did during a rally in Florida on Wednesday in support of serial groper Donald Trump. Don t tell me if you said that you remember September 11, 2001,  Giuliani said in reference to Hillary talking about being in the city.  I remember September 11, 2001. Yes, yes, you helped to get benefits for the people who were injured that day. But I heard her say that she was there that day. I was there that day, I don t remember seeing Hillary Clinton there. That was like when she said she had to run through gunfire. That turned out to be, what do we call it? A lie. But don t tell me that you subscribe to the notion that all of us who were there on September 11, and we re lucky to have been alive and lost so many friends. I lost so many friends on September 11, I think about it every day. Don t tell me you belong to our very, very tight group of  never forget.  Don t tell me that.

She was in Washington D.C. heading to the Senate when evacuations were underway.The next day, Hillary went to New York City to stand in solidarity with Giuliani and Governor George Pataki, both Republicans, and tour the devastation.As for Giuliani never seeing Hillary, a single photo makes everything pretty damn clear as my colleague Oliver Willis pointed out On Twitter.

Look to your left, Rudy. pic.twitter.com/zJbVFMDhuf  Oliver Willis (@owillis) October 12, 2016 Look to the left,  indeed.It s completely unfair for Republicans to pretend that they were the only ones who went through 9/11. The fact is that the entire country went through it, even if they were not physically there. Besides, Hillary was in our nation s capital that day when terrorists flew a plane into the Pentagon.But, hey, at least Giuliani s memory is improving. Only a few weeks ago he forgot that 9/11 ever happened.Featured Image: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",News,"October 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Donald Trump Walked Into Dressing Rooms To Look At Naked Miss Teen USA Contestants,"Not only is Donald Trump an admitted serial groper and adulterer, he s a bonafide pervert who likes looking at nude underage teen girls.In 2005, Trump bragged to Billy Bush about how he is able to walk up to women and  grab them by the p*ssy  because he is  a star.  Well, that remark just got even creepier because he bragged to Howard Stern in the same year that he  gets away with  walking into dressing rooms to look at naked Miss Teen USA contestants because he owns the pageant. I ll go backstage and everyone s getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I m allowed to go in because I m the owner of the pageant and therefore I m inspecting it   Is everyone OK?  You know, they re standing there with no clothes.  Is everybody OK?  And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that. Indeed, so it sounds like Donald Trump only purchased Miss USA, Miss Universe, and Miss Teen USA so that he could have easy access to women and girls and he abused his power in order to violate their privacy.And that s exactly what Trump did according to several women who have come forward to reveal that Trump walked in on them, some of whom were only 15 years old, changing in their dressing room. I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like,  Oh my god, there s a man in here,  former Miss Vermont Teen USA Mariah Billado told Buzzfeed. Billado even remembers Trump remarking,  Don t worry, ladies, I ve seen it all before. But there s more.According to Buzzfeed,Three other women, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of getting engulfed in a media firestorm, also remembered Trump entering the dressing room while girls were changing. Two of them said the girls rushed to cover their bodies, with one calling it  shocking  and  creepy.  The third said she was clothed and introduced herself to Trump.Seriously, Donald Trump should have been on the sex offender list. He sure as hell shouldn t be the nominee of a major political party for the presidency.But Republicans continue to support Trump despite his lewd comments and predatory behavior. Their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters must be so proud.Featured Image: Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"October 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Female GOP Leader RAGE QUITS Over Party’s Support For Trump’s Serial Sexual Assaults,"Another Republican woman is telling the GOP to go f*ck themselves because they still support Donald Trump.Melissa Gesing had hoped that her party would condemn and drop their endorsement of Donald Trump entirely after audio emerged of the Republican nominee bragging about groping women.But after the national leader of the organization she belongs to announced their continuing support of the admitted serial groper, Gesing reached her breaking point.National Federation of Republican Women President Carrie Almond made a statement reaffirming the group s  unified support of Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J. Trump  because  thousands of women from all 50 states, from every walk of life, are steadfast in our very clear understanding that Hillary Clinton does not represent us; not as women, not as Americans. Well, that s not true at all considering Gesing officially and publicly resigned from her position as the president of the Iowa Federation of Republican Women on Tuesday. Since I cannot support Donald J. Trump for President, nor can I advocate for his election, I feel that I cannot adequately fulfill my duties of my position,  Gesing wrote in her resignation letter that she posted on Twitter.  Additionally, I cannot support the National Federation of Republican Women President Carrie Almond s statement that was released yesterday on behalf of Republican women nationally, as I do not support Donald J. Trump This is truly a last resort for me. I cannot in good conscience lead this organization or look at myself in the mirror each morning if I do not take a stand against the racism, sexism, and hate that Donald J. Trump continues to promote. Here s the full letter via Twitter.This is incredibly painful for me to do, and I wish our next #IowaFRW president   whomever that may be   all the best. #NeverTrump pic.twitter.com/iYnUEQoW64  Melissa Gesing (@melissagesing) October 12, 2016Gesing is not the only Republican woman to rebuke Trump this week. In fact, a Wisconsin activist who has always defended Republicans against charges of sexism officially left the party entirely in a series of posts on Twitter that made it clear how disgusted she is by the decision of many Republicans to continue supporting Trump despite his lewd remarks about women. Various men in the movement are writing it off as normal, confirming every stereotype the left has thrown at them,  Marybeth Glenn wrote.  So I m done. I m sooo done. If you can t stand up for women & unendorse this piece of human garbage, you deserve every charge of sexism thrown at you. The Republican Party better be prepared for women to punish them by a landslide on November 8th. Because women are pissed and they WILL remember.Featured Image: Twitter",News,"October 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s GOP Mega Donors Are Demanding A Full Refund,"Now that Donald Trump has shot himself in the foot by picking a fight with the entire Republican Party (after leaked revelations showed him gleefully admitting to sexually assaulting women), the party s mega-donors are demanding Trump give them their money back.According to NBC News, two big-moneyed donors want a refund, and one who raised tens-of-thousands for the candidate wrote the campaign an angry email titled  Trump support withdrawal  and blasted the candidate:I cannot express my disappointment enough regarding the recent events surrounding Mr. Trump. I regret coming to the Trump support event, and in particular allowing my son to be a part of it. I respectfully request that my money be refunded.The donor, who was not identified by NBC, said he was  repulsed  by Trump s comments and that as a father to two daughters preparing to marry, just couldn t support him any longer.The second donor who emailed the campaign (also anonymous) cited the leaked tapes as reasoning behind their buyers remorse, and also demanded they be reimbursed:I can not (sic) support a sexist man. I have three young children and will not support a crude sexist man. I expect a refund of my donation. Please process immediately and I thank you for your help.A third donor, a mega-bundler who s raised also $1 million for Trump, said that he will cease raising money for Trump cold turkey, but has not (as of yet) asked for the money back.While already struggling to attract the support of the Republican donors, the latest example of buyer s remorse from a slew of mega-fundraisers could spell trouble for the Trump campaign with 3 weeks left in the campaign.Who can blame them? After 16 months of convincing weary Republican donors that he was their guy, his ugly fa ade was peeled back to expose an even more nefarious side that liberals tried to warn them about. The donors were duped, humiliated, and have now had their reputations sullied. No wonder they want their money back.I would feel bad for them except they knew, all along, he was a snake.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: This Is Why Conservative ‘Christians’ REALLY Still Support Serial Molestor Donald Trump,"By his own admission, Donald Trump is a serial groper who cheats on his wife.But that doesn t matter to conservative  Christian  leaders, who seem to be the only ones who still support the Republican nominee.When Trump s grotesque remarks about grabbing women  by the p*ssy  dropped like a bombshell on Friday, Republicans rushed to distance themselves from him. Conservative  Christian  leaders, however, demonstrated that they are true hypocrites by continuing to back Trump.Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council said that his  personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values.  Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition said that Trump s words  rank very low  is his concerns. Pat Robertson thinks Trump is  macho  for groping women.And now Dave Daubenmire is going even further than those other hypocrites.The Ohio pastor still supports Trump because he would rather put a groper in the White House instead of a woman. Women and men may be equal, but I think it s pretty clear that the Bible teaches us that women should not be in authority over a man,  Daubenmire said. Here s the point I m making. With all that s going on with Trump and everybody screaming and hollering about that, when is the last time your pastor stood up in the pulpit and said,  Hey, listen, we cannot vote for Hillary Clinton because women are not to have authority over men ? If we want to follow the Bible, that would sure be a good place to start, wouldn t it? Rather than worrying so much about the immorality of a sinful man, what about the biblical principle that when a woman rules over a man   it s a sign of judgment of the Lord? Here s the video via YouTube.So let s get this straight. It doesn t matter how many sins Donald Trump commits. It wouldn t even matter if he is the anti-Christ or the devil himself. Conservative  Christian  men like Daubenmire are going to STILL vote for him just because they don t want a woman to be president.That s the real reason why conservatives are still devoted to Trump. It s 2016 and these so-called  men of God  still believe women only belong in a kitchen completely subservient to them. This is the agenda they are hoping to pass under a Trump administration. A total rollback of women s rights to the point where women can t vote and cannot even speak without permission from a man. And this is exactly why women should vote against Republicans by a landslide in November.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘I’m Going To Beat Your Ass!’ Trump Fan Arrested For Threatening Black Woman Just Waiting For A Cab,"A Donald Trump supporter was arrested Monday after threatening to beat a black woman and calling her racial slurs outside a ShopRite store, according to the Albany police. 55-year-old Todd Warnken was told to leave the store after  being disruptive inside,  Albany police spokesman Steve Smith told the Albany Times-Union.Once Warnken left the store, he encountered a black woman who was waiting for a taxi. According to the police, he harassed the woman then proceeded to threaten physical harm.Smith told the paper that Warnken yelled to the woman,  Trump is going to win and if you don t like it I m going to beat your ass,  while using a racial slur. We can only imagine the language he used.Violence at Trump rallies has been well documented. In March, in Tucson, Arizona. A protester at a Trump rally was sucker-punched and kicked by a 32-year-old man. He was arrested on an assault charge. In March, a Trump supporter sucker-punched a black protester at a rally in North Carolina. The Trump supporter said later,  Next time we might have to kill him. It s not just the violence at rallies. A Trump supporter in August was arrested for assaulting his 73-year-old Clinton-supporting wife.The list is endless, but here are two more examples:In March, two Wichita State University students said they were beaten in a convenience store parking lot by a man they said called them  brown trash  and told them  Trump will make America great again. Two brothers in Boston were sentenced to prison in May for beating a homeless Mexican man because they thought he was an undocumented immigrant, telling police Trump  was right  about deporting  all these illegals. There has been an uptick of attacks on Muslims, too. Don t call them deplorable, though, because that hurts their feelings. Donald Trump has called for his supporters to observe voters at the polls in an obvious attempt to intimidate minorities. Trump s favorability with African-Americans polls at a whopping zero percent.As for Warnken, he s been charged with misdemeanor aggravated harassment.Image via Albany Police Department.

 WATCH: Obama PERFECTLY Mocks Trump’s Insane Followers That Think He’s A Literal Demon,"Conservative radio show host Alex Jones recently proclaimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton are really demons, sent by Lucifer himself no doubt. No, he did not mean metaphorically. He meant literally. As proof of their evil origins, Jones claimed that they both smell like  sulphur  and  hell. Apparently, somebody mentioned to this to the president. So, while speaking at an event on the campaign trail for Clinton, Obama decided to give himself a sniff test on Tuesday night, just to check for any suspicious demonic odors. we demonize each other. And I mean that literally, by the way. I was reading the other day, there s a guy on the radio who apparently, Trump s on his show frequently, he said me and Hillary are demons. Said we smell like sulphur. Ain t that somethin ? President Obama then performed his sniff test, smelling his hand as the crowd laughed at the absurdity of Jones  bullsh*t. Now,  the president began before he burst into laughter along with the crowd.  I mean, come on, people! This is what the right wing nut jobs have reduced us to.

 Trump’s Campaign CEO LITERALLY Ordered His Minions To Destroy Paul Ryan Months Ago,"Steve Bannon, Trump s campaign CEO who was the editor-in-chief at right-wing rag Breitbart, apparently ordered his staff there to destroy Paul Ryan not too long after Ryan took over Boehner s mantle as Speaker of the House. Some of this revelation comes courtesy of Michelle Fields, the Breitbart reporter who was thrown under the bus after she spoke out about Corey Lewandowski grabbing her.At Breitbart Bannon literally directed folks to destroy Ryan Hes prob so happy rn seeing Ryan too scared to unendorse a campaign hes running  Michelle Fields (@MichelleFields) October 11, 2016For his part, Bannon seemed to have a habit of calling Ryan  the enemy  while on editorial conference calls, and even wrote an email that said: Long game is Ryan gone by spring. This was back in December 2015, and now, Bannon s probably thinking they should step up their game after Ryan refused to campaign with Trump. Compared to Trump and Bannon, Ryan is a paragon of human decency. Like any decent human being, he was sickened by the leaked audio tape of Trump saying his celebrity status allowed him to  grab women by the pussy. Trump himself went nuts on Ryan on Twitter after Ryan condemned him, calling him weak and ineffective. He also slammed the entire Republican Party for not standing by him in what his hour of need? Do alpha males even have those?A former Breitbart employee also confirmed that Bannon used to tear into Paul Ryan all the time. Bannon, apparently, can be at least as crazy as Alex Jones when it comes to conspiracy theories. He had his own conspiracy theory about Ryan s succession to House Speaker: [Bannon] goes on these amazing rants. He thinks Paul Ryan is part of a conspiracy with George Soros and Paul Singer, in which elitists want to bring one world government. It also includes a belief that Ryan  masterminded a failed plot to bring down Trump.  It s difficult to get more crazy than this, but this is the man who is Trump s campaign CEO.Of course, people who are close to both Trump and Bannon are framing this latest feud of butthurt as general anger with the establishment, and nothing more. That seems to be an attempt to distance Trump from all the conspiracy nuts, and might be effective if Trump wasn t a conspiracy nut himself.This is probably why Trump wanted Bannon   they re two peas in the crazy pod. One of these days, these two idiots may actually figure out that they re the problem, and not everyone else. But we shouldn t hold our breath for that. Bannon also said that the campaign  needs to bitch-slap the Republican Party.  If a moment of regret happens, it ll happen years in the future when they re on their deathbeds.Photo of Steve Bannon by Kirk Irwin/Getty Images for SiriusXM.

 This Congressman’s Terrifying Statement PROVES Trump Supporters Are A Dangerous Cult (VIDEO),"For the last year and a half, observers have wondered what Donald Trump would have to say or do in order to shake the confidence of his most diehard supporters.They have stuck with him for almost the entire race, and while there are not enough of them for him to win the election, they provide a definite floor of support for his campaign as well.Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-TX) appeared on MSNBC s All In and gave a jaw-dropping response for the type of behavior he would excuse from Trump.MSNBC s Chris Hayes tested the limits of his allegiance. In an interview Tuesday night, Hayes asked Farenthold if he would continue to support Trump  if a tape came out with Donald Trump saying  I really like to rape women. Farenthold s answer: maybe.The Congressman said  I like to rape women  could be a form of  locker room talk  depending on the  context. Hayes went on to ask Farenthold to elaborate on his answer, and he would only go so far as to say such a statement would  be bad  and that he would  consider  pulling his support.Here s the video:[ad3media campaign= 1118 ]The answer gives yet another real world example of the cult of personality surrounding Trump and his presidential campaign, and the devotion his small but dedicated supporters have to the former reality TV star. Trump himself acknowledged this bubble around his campaign some months ago, when he pointed out that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City and still retain their support.But this devotion is also a major turnoff to everyone outside of the inner circle of support. While progressives have expressed frustration that nothing makes these supporters waver, it also comes off as creepy and strange to those looking in from the outside   just as happens with most cults, like the Church of Scientology or Heaven s Gate or Jim Jones  People s Temple.For a political campaign, it isn t a good look.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama To GOP: Decent Human Beings Would Not Stand Behind Trump (VIDEO),"At a Hillary Clinton rally in Greensboro, NC on Tuesday evening, President Obama took the stage to praise his former Secretary of State, but also to address the horrible comments Donald Trump was heard saying on video 11 years ago.In the tapes, Trump was about to appear on Access Hollywood. He was talking to co-host Billy Bush and the rhetoric was both lewd and it described sexual assault. Here s part of it: I ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,  Trump says.  You know I m automatically attracted to beautiful   I just start kissing them. It s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don t even wait. And when you re a star, they let you do it,  Trump says.  You can do anything. Whatever you want,  says another voice, apparently Bush s. Grab them by the p y,  Trump says.  You can do anything. President Obama, like any decent human being, was offended. He is also offended at the paternalistic reaction of Republicans, who tend to be offended, instead of as human beings, as fathers or as husbands.You don t have to be a husband or a father to hear what we heard just a few days ago and say,  that s not right.  You just have to be a decent human being to say,  that s not right,  Obama said at a rally in Greensboro, N.C., for Hillary Clinton.Here s the video:.@POTUS: Don t have to be husband or father to object to Trump comments,  you just have to be a decent human being  https://t.co/GhBJX17w9c  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 11, 2016This isn t the first time Obama has spoken out about the video. On Sunday, the President said that Trump couldn t even get a job at 7/11 with his background. The guy says stuff no would find tolerable if you were applying to a job at 7/11,  he said of the Republican presidential nominee. [Trump] doesn t have the temperament or the judgement or the knowledge or apparently the desire to obtain the knowledge or the basic honesty required to be president. That was true before we heard what he said about women. Donald Trump is running for one of the most important jobs in the world. He s not taking it seriously and neither are his supporters. Trump s sense of entitlement was evident long before he admitted to being a sexual predator. Now, let s hope he doesn t do to the nation what he s done to countless women.Featured image via video screen capture.

 Republicans Say Trump MUST Stop Pushing This Conspiracy Theory Or People Will Get Hurt,"The Republican civil war is heating up as members of the party have begun an all-out campaign to stop their own presidential nominee from causing harm to the country. That (probably futile) battle is taking shape as Republicans are now asking Trump to stop claiming that the election is  rigged. Somebody claiming in the election,  I was defrauded , that isn t going to cut it,  said former Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican who earlier in the campaign had endorsed Jeb Bush and then Marco Rubio.  They re going to have to say how, where, why, when. I don t think leading candidates for the presidency should undercut the process unless you have a really good reason,  Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who gained little support for his own 2016 White House run, told POLITICO.Like the Trump campaign itself, this is another case of Republicans now being forced to reap what they have sown. For years they have pushed the idea that voter fraud is rampant, when in reality it is almost nonexistent.Now Trump is using those fears   especially of black voters in urban areas   to scare his supporters and set up a reason to wail and cry if he loses the election.In fact, the current polling indicates that Hillary Clinton is favored to win, and in all the swing states key to an election victory she has a far bigger and better funded operation to get out the vote. Trump has tried to create a national political operation on the cheap, preferring to spend money on his own companies rather than invest in a  ground game. As a result, Trump is heavily relying on state parties, who tend to prioritize House and Senate races over the presidential contest, and do not have the kind of money on hand to properly equip a presidential campaign.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Made Comedy Central Sorry They Ever Wanted To Roast Him In 2011,"The Comedy Central roasts of celebrities are well known and hilarious, for the most part. While it doesn t look like the roastees know what s going on, and that everything is entirely off-the-cuff, the truth is that there is a lot of preparation ahead of the actual roast. Roastees get some input, even getting to tell the comedy writers what subjects are off-limits for jokes, but, beyond that, they don t dictate very much.And then there s Donald Trump. Putting his roast together seems to have been one long, horrific chore for the Comedy Central team assigned to it. In fact, that roast is perhaps some of the strongest evidence we ve got that Trump is unconscionably thin-skinned, and will continue to be after the election. Roastees for the Comedy Central roasts know what s involved. They know they re going to be skewered. If they don t like the idea, they don t have to do it.It makes us want to look at Trump and say,  DUH!  At Comedy Central, Trump apparently wanted to dictate everything, all the way down to the level of beauty in the women who were to escort him on stage. According to the stage manager: The proposed woman [who would take his coat onstage], Trump said, was  not somebody he wanted to be associated with at that moment,  Ferkle recalled.  In other words, she was not pretty enough. To appease Trump, Comedy Central moved the actress elsewhere on the stage, Ferkle said. The show went on. That s fairly typical Trumpian misogyny, so not all that surprising. What s perhaps more surprising were the other ways that Trump drove the staff up the wall. For instance, he was apparently giving the show s writers and producers hell over whether jokes about his hair were allowed. The lead writer, Ray James, tried working with Trump on why hair jokes were a necessary part of the roast. Trump resisted, because of course he did: I had to explain to him why he needed to have some jokes about his own hair. I said,  You have to own it. If you have a great hair joke, you will be impervious to hair jokes.' Instead, Trump kept nixing the hair jokes, and wanted to replace one of them with a simple,  Look how great [my hair] looks. Because that s just hilarious. But perhaps the most annoying thing was that the writers had to draft multiple rebuttals for Trump. The rebuttal comes at the end of the roast, when the roastee gets up and turns it all back on his or her roasters. Trump was returning scripts marked up entirely with black Sharpies, including blacking out punchlines.Nobody blacks out punchlines, according to the roast s producers and writers. One writer, Jesse Joyce, said: I have done this a long time and nobody blacks out punchlines. [Scrapping punchlines represents] a classic lack of an understanding of how a joke works. And Trump couldn t be consistent about his edits (if, indeed, they can be called that), either. He took out some opportunities to be crass while wallowing in others. He also changed some of the jokes from  funny  to  not funny;  again, showing a fundamental unwillingness to even try and understand what was being put before him: Trump made a few lackluster attempts at cracking wise. He changed a joke meant to slam [Seth] MacFarlane from:  The only way you ll ever draw a crowd is with a pencil.  Trump s revision:  The only crowd you ll attract is flies.' He also wanted to roast the entire dais at once by, well, being entirely himself. How this is even a joke is beyond us, since everything he does is to feel superior to everyone on the planet: Their [sic] all losers and I like associating with loser because it makes me feel even better about myself. It got to the point where Ray James just wanted to destroy Trump in any way possible: I begged any writer to get on board,  James said.  Let s write jokes about this guy having a small cock.   I wanted to destroy this man and expose him as having a tiny penis because that will hurt him more than any jokes about his family or orange skin.' That didn t work. Furthermore, given the fact that Trump just had to talk about his penis size in response to Rubio s jab about his tiny hands during a televised debate, it s likely the dick jokes probably wouldn t have made it in anyway. If they had, he probably would have lost it up onstage.The entire roast was classic Trump. He sat on the stage with a tight smile, not really responding, much the same way he did at the 2011 White House correspondents dinner when Obama roasted him. Despite knowing what was coming, he couldn t take anyone making fun of him and probably relished trying to hurt them back.Comedy Central s president sees the roast as prophetic of what s happening today: It is impossible to not see how absurd the whole thing is. If you go back and watch the roast, there re probably a lot of oddly prophetic things being said that are relevant today. But just the idea that someone who did a Comedy Central Roast [is] a major party [nominee] for president is pretty shocking. Especially when that person couldn t handle being criticized, teased, or otherwise treated as anything other than the god he thinks he is.Featured image by Andrew H.

 Hillary SHUTS DOWN Trump Supporters Calling Her Husband A Rapist At Rally (VIDEO),"Ever since Donald Trump got exposed through an audio tape leak for bragging about how he sexually assaults women, Trump supporters have been sticking up for their favorite misogynist more than ever.Following in the Republican nominee s footsteps, their only defense against the truth in those tapes is to put blame on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s husband, former President Bill Clinton, for the rape allegations against him.Hillary is taking this all in stride, and is completely shutting down any Trump lovers who dare hijack her rallies and distract voters from focusing on moving America forward. During a rally with Al Gore in Florida today, Clinton s talk on climate change was interrupted by Trump supporters who were yelling about her husband being a rapist. Here s a video of one such supporter, who obviously refuses to acknowledge the fact that his own candidate has several rape cases against him, one involving a minor. For 2nd day in a row, a protester has interrupted HRC by yelling:  Bill Clinton is a rapist.

They re doing it because radio host Alex Jones is offering to give anyone who can get on camera and call Bill Clinton a rapist $5,000. So basically, these people are just trying to get paid   much like Trump himself.On the upside, it looks like Hillary can t be rattled by anything Trump and his pathetic Trump supporters do at this point!Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"October 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BUSTED: Trump Fired A Woman For Saying THIS In His Boardroom (VIDEO),"Donald Trump thinks he should be president despite bragging about sexually assaulting women by grabbing them  by the p*ssy.  But he once fired a woman for saying something far less inflammatory in his boardroom.During the final moments of an episode of Celebrity Apprentice in 2010, Trump listened as professional wrestler, Maria Kanellis, blasted chef Curtis Stone for using her dressing room to take a  crap. The reason why I said you were so arrogant was because you came in our dressing room and you took a crap and left the stench in the room,  Kanellis said while seated in the boardroom facing Trump as his son, Donald Jr., looked on.Even though his behavior was completely inappropriate, Stone and Trump focused on Kanellis using the word  crap,  calling it  a little below the belt.  Trump also called her use of the word  disgusting  and  gross  before firing her for using locker room talk. This is my boardroom, it s not a locker room. Maria, you re fired. Here s the video via Twitter:Donald Trump in 2010:  This is my boardroom. It's not a locker room. Maria, you re fired.   \_( )_/  pic.twitter.com/UlsP9Xjg7F  The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) October 10, 2016As you can see, this is prime example of Trump s hypocrisy. Ever since audio of his outrageous remarks about groping women came to light on Friday, Trump and his team have been writing the remarks off as mere  locker room talk  that should have no bearing on the election.But unlike the celebrities in the boardroom, Donald Trump is trying to gain the highest office in the United States, so his remarks, especially his use of the word  p*ssy,  should absolutely be held against him. They reveal his lack of character and how he treats women, whereas saying the word  crap  is pretty damn harmless in comparison.Donald Trump literally fired Kanellis for saying  crap  in his own boardroom, but he thinks he should be hired by the American people as the new president, despite using a worse word to describe how he sexually assaults women. Trump is nothing more than a misogynist who holds women to a standard that he can t follow himself. Firing a woman for saying a word instead of firing the man who took a shit in her dressing room, uninvited, proves that Trump will not be able to treat women fairly in the White House, and that he would let male employees get away with bad behavior towards them.This is not the kind of person we need leading our country.Featured Image: Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BOMBSHELL: Trump Called ‘The Apprentice’ Sound Guy A ‘F***ing Monkey’ Over And Over (DETAILS),"A microphone guy who worked on The Apprentice just came forward to tell the world that Donald Trump often referred to him as a  f*cking monkey. According to Buzzfeed News, the sound engineer is white, but he wanted his story to be heard without his name being released, because apparently, Trump was quite a monster to him and to many others, including to women whom he sexually harassed.He told Buzzfeed: Micing him was honestly the most abusive, humiliating, experience of my fifteen years as a sound engineer. He treated me like I wasn t a human being. In fact, there were several times Trump would refer to him as a  f*cking monkey.  Trump would say: Woah, woah woah, who s this fucking monkey? As well as: I m not gonna let this fucking monkey touch me unless he washes his hands. Then he would be monitored by Trump s assistant to make sure he went and washed his hands.He also told Buzzfeed: Trump just kept calling me a  f*cking monkey  over and over. I ve mic d everyone from Ben Affleck to Ren e Zellweger, and never, ever in my career have I run into something like that. Apparently, working for him was pretty much one of the worst gigs in town. He was a monster to many, many people, including several women he would sexually harass. And after listening to Trump on the released Access Hollywood tapes, that is very, very easy to believe.Trump is not a person who should be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office. He s a racist and misogynistic egomaniac who seems to have a short temper while having none of the required experience to be leader of the free world.Something tells me there will be more and more of these stories coming out as we get closer to election day, and hopefully, it will be the icing on the cake to make sure he s never, ever elected president.Featured Photo by Amanda Edwards/Getty Images",News,"October 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Apprentice’ Contestants Reveal MORE Shocking Info About How Trump Treats Women (VIDEO/TWEETS),"After the 2005 audio tape of Republican nominee, Donald Trump, making lewd comments about sexually assaulting women, there s been a lot of buzz about the existence of even more incriminating Trump footage from The Apprentice.While no tapes have been released yet, The Hollywood Reporter interviewed several Apprentice contestants who were more than willing to spill the beans on what behavior they saw from Trump during their time on the reality TV show   and it s not good.According to a camera operator, the comments that Trump made on that leaked audio tape are an exact representation of who Trump is   something Trump himself denied during the second presidential debate. The camera operator said that while Trump was a host on the show, the business mogul would regularly make women feel uncomfortable with what he called  borderline sexual misconduct  and blatant sexism. The camera operator said: It was more a creepy feeling you felt when he was around on set. The way he looked at you or would be dismissive to all the female producers and only deal with Mark Burnett   he was just an overall assh*le who thought of himself as very important. Another contestant said that Trump would objectify his female contestants, only remarking on their appearance. He would also demean them and speak to them as if they were children, which was very different from how Trump treated the men on his show: When we first started shooting and there were still a lot of contestants and you don t necessarily know all their names well, he definitely would describe the girls by their bodies and their physical attributes. Marshawn Evans, a former contestant, further explained: If you were in the middle of the discussion or talking about the merits of why you won or lost, sometimes you would be interrupted with a compliment or something that had to do with your physical attributes. That happened pretty much every single time you re in the boardroom. And it wasn t just contestants that were targeted. Trump also disrespected female crew members. According to one source: We would not necessarily send the girl camera crews to do the close-up stuff just because it was always weird. I know one of our camera operators would get uncomfortable. I found out from her after the fact that he was saying things to her. Dr. Randal Pinkett, who was the 2005 Apprentice winner, has also spoken out against Trump to confirm that he is absolutely a misogynist and racist. He said: It was not uncommon on the set of  The Apprentice  for Donald to make public comments about women s looks, about who he would sleep with or who he would ask others would they sleep with. It was demeaning, disrespectful, almost reprehensible behavior for a professional environment. He has been divisive, he has been sexist, he has been misogynist, he s been racist. This is not, in my opinion, the leader that we need for our country at this time.

" In Unprecedented Endorsement, Non-Partisan Humane Society Has BRUTAL Words For Trump (VIDEO)","The Humane Society of the United States pretty much never weighs into politics, unless, of course, it s about an issue that directly affects animals. This is no normal election, though, and after a series of pictures in which Donald Trump s sons gleefully show their murdered animal  trophies,  and after seeing Trump s potential nominees, the animal rights group had to weigh in, calling Trump a  threat to animals everywhere. The next president will have an enormous impact over animal protection in this country for the next four to eight years, and the stakes are high with policy decisions overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Institutes of Health, and other executive agencies. When you consider the potential for advancing animal welfare reforms at the federal level, or rolling back the recent gains and rulemaking actions, there could not be a greater contrast among the White House hopefuls. One ticket has a clear, compelling record of support for animal protection, while the other has assembled a team of advisors and financial supporters tied in with trophy hunting, puppy mills, factory farming, horse slaughter, and other abusive industries. The names that Trump s campaign has floated for engagement on Interior and Agriculture department issues are a  who s who  of zealous anti-animal welfare activists.The photos of Trump s trophy hunting sons were bad enough. The pictures show the two men with their trophy kills, which include Cape buffalo, waterbuck, a leopard and even an elephant tail. African elephants and leopards are nearly extinct. The group compared the two to Walter Palmer, the dentist who shot Cecil the lion.This might just be symbolic, but Donald Jr. has been floated as possible Interior Secretary.The risk of having a globe-trotting trophy hunter at or near the helm at Interior, or having the ear of the President, should be a terrifying prospect for any animal advocate. The administration is responsible not only for policies involving hundreds of millions of acres of federal lands, but also wildlife law enforcement, international treaties on trade and conservation, and import policies for wild animal parts and trophies.They also note several other potential cabinet members, including oil tycoon Forrest Lucas, who is anti-animal welfare. For Secretary of Agriculture, Trump has mentioned pork farmer Bruce Rastetter, who is known for building the very same pig gestation crates that the state of New Jersey tried to ban and Trump surrogate Chris Christie vetoed the bill.Several other possible candidates also worry the Humane Society, but they are very favorable toward Hillary Clinton.While Trump has advocates for trophy hunting, puppy mills, factory farming, and horse slaughter on his side, Hillary Clinton has a strong record of taking a stand against many of these issues. She published an animal welfare statement on her campaign website, noting that  [t]he way our society treats animals is a reflection of our humanity.  Clinton highlights the humane issues she plans to tackle as President, as well as her strong record on animal protection in the U.S. Senate and as Secretary of State. She pledges to crack down on abuses such as wildlife trafficking, puppy mills, and horse slaughter, and to support a federal anti-cruelty statute and more humane treatment of farm animals.It s not just who he advocates that makes Trump so dangerous for animals, it s also what he advocates, and that is the near total elimination of regulations. One of Trump s least favorite regulatory agencies is the Food and Drug Administration, which he laughs at, because they regulate dog food. The strong implication is that Trump doesn t care about any animals, not even pets. The Humane Society is right. He is a threat to animals everywhere, even the two legged kind.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"October 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Mike Pence SHUTS DOWN Crazy Trump Supporter For Threatening Hillary (VIDEO),"Throughout the course of Donald Trump s campaign for the presidency, he s been stoking fears around the nation. His goal seems to be to lead through fear and if he can get enough people to believe the lies that he tells, they ll fall in line behind him to be their leader and protector.All of that is absolute poppycock because Trump wouldn t know how to protect you from a falling feather, let alone understand what it takes to be leader of the free world.Now, appearing at Trump s running-mate Mike Pence s campaign event on Tuesday, a Trump supporter brought up Trump s myth of  voter fraud.  Which is that if he loses, it s because Hillary cheated, not at all because he s a horrible human being.Ironically, the only voter fraud currently being perpetrated is by Republicans trying to suppress the vote.However, this woman in the audience, with fear and horror in her voice, brought up the  voter fraud  Trump often talks about. The woman said she s  ready for a revolution because we can t have [Hillary] in. When Pence heard that he stopped the woman in her tracks and said,  don t say that.  And good on him for doing so. Pence then reiterated that the revolution needs to happen is at the voting booth on November 8th. Which, in all honesty, is an incredibly accurate and thoughtful response.Pence seems to understand that democracy isn t claiming the other side won because they cheated, but rather getting out the vote so that your side wins.That being said, Hillary Clinton is about to kick Trump s ass this November and it s because more people will want her over a racist a**hole who admits to sexual assault.Watch the video here: Woman:  If Hillary Clinton gets in I m ready for a revolution, b/c we can t have her in Pence:  Don t say that  https://t.co/P5OrJBGW55  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 11, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Eric Trump: ‘Alpha Personalities’ Brag About Sexual Assault, It’s Just What They Do","Eric Trump, one of Donald Trump s two creepy adult sons, tried on Monday to defend his father s revolting comments about sexually assaulting women. His pathetic excuse? That s just what happens when  alpha  males get together and start talking.The younger Trump followed the narrative that has been put forth by everybody else in his daddy s campaign: It s no big whoop, it s just locker room banter.  And besides, it s the Clintons who we should really be talking about. I think that s Hillary going low,  Eric Trump said on Tuesday.  I think you ve seen that for a long time. If you look at her track record with women, I think you saw that yesterday with some of the people we had sitting at the debate. It s horrible. She ll dig out dirt on someone from 15 years ago when someone is in entertainment. And, listen, my father apologized for it. He was right to apologize for it, and I m glad he apologized for it,  he continued.  At the same time, if you look at her track record with women, it s horrible. It s absolutely horrible. Nevermind the fact that there isn t one shred of evidence that the Clintons were behind the release of the bombshell  p*ssy  tape.Eric added that he was completely  surprised it came out. At the same time, I think it s locker room banter,  he said, repeating his father s description of it.  I think sometimes when guys are together they get carried away, and sometimes that s what happens when alpha personalities are in the same presence. At the same time, I m not saying it s right. It s not the person that he is. So, there s nothing to see here folks. Ignore that my father will soon be sitting before a judge after being accused of raping a 13-year-old child. Forget that he nags out with the likes of proven sexual predators like Jeffery Epstein and Roger Ailes. He s just an  alpha  male and all  alpha  males  brag about sexual assault.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 BREAKING: GOP Civil War Kicks Off With A Blast As Trump LOSES HIS SH*T At Paul Ryan (TWEETS),"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is in full implosion mode. Ever since a lewd, misogynistic tape of him on an Access Hollywood bus with then-host Billy Bush surfaced on Friday, GOP establishment has been fleeing the Trump Train in an effort to save their own skins in down-ballot races. However, the party leaders   namely House Speaker Paul Ryan   were largely still supportive, even while condemning Trump s indefensible remarks.Well, that all changed on Monday, when Ryan told members of the House Republicans that he would no longer defend nor campaign for his party s toxic nominee, and told down-ballot candidates to do what they have to do to save their own seats in their districts. Trump, never one to be able to let things go when he feels slighted in any way, for any reason, has decided to go into full-blown war mode against his own party s establishment. Trump took to Twitter to blast them all, and it is still happening as we speak. Here s his big  f**k you  to Paul Ryan and all the rest:Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2016Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.  Donald J.

If you ever doubted that the GOP cares more about their party than they do their country, here s your proof that there is no doubt to be had here. They d rather nominate a lunatic who would end civilization as they know it than see a Democrat in the White House. They created this monster, and now that they ve lost control of him, they have not a clue as to what to do about it.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"October 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: ‘The View’ Unanimously Rips Trump A New One For Groping Comments And It’s AMAZING,"The women of The View played the tape of Trump s grotesque remarks about groping women and they unanimously condemned him.The panelists of the show have a wide range of political views from liberal to conservative, but Trump s bragging about grabbing women  by the p*ssy  united them all against the Republican nominee and his campaign on Monday.Sunny Hostin kicked things off by explaining that she talked to a lot of men about Trump s remarks and even asked her husband and 14-year-old football player son if what Trump said is the kind of things men talk about in locker rooms. She said that none of the men she talked to said this is typical locker room talk and her son was  horrified  by what Trump said and confirmed that not even teenage boys talk that way in locker rooms. Men don t talk about sexually assaulting women,  she said.Whoopi Goldberg chimed in by calling Trump s behavior  piggish,  which Joy Behar said  is saying the least. Sara Haines said his remark  turned my stomach  and pointed out that men don t make a move on women by groping them.  It s about power  she continued.Hostin continued by pointing out that what Trump is bragging about is a crime punishable with time behind bars. And she would know since she is a former prosecutor who prosecuted sex crimes. Classic sexual assault,  she said. People go to jail for that. He wants Hillary Clinton to go to jail? Maybe he needs to go to jail for sexually assaulting people. The audience cheered wildly for Hostin s statement, and then Jedediah Bila took her turn. He s talking about it like he was some kid in a locker room,  Bila said.  Yeah, maybe you ll find some stray person in a locker room that s talking like that, but they re not all running for president! They re not all trying to be the leader of the free world, Donald! Goldberg noted that four former presidents, two Democrats and two Republicans have all said that Trump is unfit for the office. Bila then sent a message to Republicans like Paul Ryan who still endorse Trump.  If you don t withdraw your endorsement, you are putting your stamp of approval on this. Here s the video via Huffington Post.If this were any other presidential election in the past, Trump would have been removed or forced to drop out by now. But Republicans are so desperate for power that they don t care how despicable their nominee is. Not only should Trump lose by a landslide in November, but every Republican down the ticket should lose as well. This election needs to send a message to the GOP that they need to change.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 High-Profile Attorney To Represent Trump’s Alleged Rape Victim In Upcoming Trial (VIDEO),"Donald J. Trump s rape trial will be held on December 16th and the alleged victim will be represented by a high profile attorney. This follows the GOP presidential nominee s leaked  hot mic  video surfacing in which he brags about sexually assaulting women.Casey Anthony was acquitted of murder charges with the help of attorney Cheney Mason and now, he s coming after Trump.The lawsuit alleges that Trump raped a 13-year-old girl at billionaire investor Jeffrey Epstein s Upper East Side mansion in 1994. The alleged victim detailed a  savage sexual attack  stating she was tied to a bed, then Trump is accused of exposing himself and raping her. Trump allegedly  responded by violently striking the victim in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. That sounds remarkably like what Trump said to Billy Bush in the leaked video:  And when you re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything. Grab  em by the pussy. The victim,  Jane Doe,  has tried to file the lawsuit three times. The first suit was dismissed over filing issues and now, another suit  was filed to add a new witness to the complaint, as Newsy notes.By the way, do you know how rare it is to have a witness to a rape?High-Profile Criminal Attorney, Cheney Mason, to Represent Trump Child Rape Victim in Upcoming Trial. pic.twitter.com/KJD0kFMOSA  Mr. Jameson Neat (@MrJamesonNeat) October 11, 2016Trump s attorneys have dismissed the accusations as an attempt to smear the GOP presidential nominee.Last year, Trump said in reference to Mexicans,  I mean somebody s doing it!  Who s doing the raping? But in reality, Republicans are not sending their best people. They re sending pussy grabbers and rapists. We need to shut the GOP down until we  find out what s going on.

" The Bush Administration Deleted 22 Million Emails, But Trump Won’t Talk About It","Donald Trump loves talking about email scandals, apparently   so then why hasn t he mentioned the millions of emails  lost  by the Bush administration? On April 27, 2007, an estimated five million emails relevant to an ongoing investigation of eight U.S. attorneys being fired were lost. As it turns out that number is closer to 22 million.The New York Times reported:WASHINGTON, April 11   Political advisers to President Bush may have improperly used their Republican National Committee e-mail accounts to conduct official government business, and some communications that are required to be preserved under federal law may be lost as a result, White House officials said Wednesday.Of the 1,000 White House officials with political duties, 22   including Karl Rove, the chief political strategist   have Republican National Committee accounts that are supposed to be used only for campaign-related work.So, while Hillary Clinton has got plenty of attention for emails she lost, the media has  forgotten  about this scandal by the Bush administration. Big surprise, right? It s not like it s relevant, or anything. Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell also had private email, but we don t talk about that, either. I wonder why? It couldn t have anything to do with the need for ratings, or the need to somehow create a close race between Hillary, who is eminently qualified, and the raging dumpster fire that is Trump, could it?Even more worryingly, many times Cheney s emails were unavailable for weeks at a time, with archives also unavailable. And yet, not a peep from Republicans, and certainly nothing from Donald Trump. It s almost as if, after 30 years of non-scandals failing to go anywhere, they re getting a little bit desperate.Donald Trump, on the other hand, has set the bar lower than ever before when it comes to transparency. He won t release medical records, he won t release tax returns, and he won t reveal his business connections or how he intends to profit from the office of the presidency. His war on the press has made it clear he has no respect for the first amendment or the right to dissent. And his scandals are only just getting started   something tells me investigations of Trump won t be so fruitless.",News,"October 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" As Trump Collapses, Team Clinton Makes A HUGE New Move To Crush The GOP","Donald Trump s presidential campaign is collapsing, thanks to his poor performance in the presidential debates, a campaign message with limited appeal, and the misogynistic assault comments he made about TV host Nancy O Dell that were released last Friday.Now it seems that groups aligned with Hillary Clinton plan to take advantage of Trump s problems, along with the huge exodus of Republicans who rescinded their support for him over the weekend.Until now, Priorities USA has spent the 2016 election cycle entirely focused on the top of the ticket   getting Clinton elected. The fact that they may use their resources to also promote Democratic candidates in down-ballot races suggests how increasingly confident they are in a Clinton victory.According to a source familiar with the plans, Priorities USA is currently producing television ads to potentially air in Senate contests in North Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania   all competitive races that are also battleground states for the presidential race.Hillary Clinton is relying on Democratic members of Congress to help her enact an agenda and defend President Obama s gains, should she be elected to the office. A so-called  wave  election would go a long way to ensuring that situation be put in place.The last time conditions were similar was in 2008 when President Obama was first elected to the White House. Two years before, Democrats won a ton of seats in the House and Senate which gave them majorities in both bodies. As a result, Democrats were able to get the economic stimulus passed, along with the Affordable Care Act (both without the help of Republicans, who had decided to completely block the Obama agenda, no matter what).Since then Republicans have put in place more so-called  gerrymandered  seats, which are congressional seats whose districts are designed to consistently favor one party over another. Republicans have done this in so many states, it is wildly believed that they have insulated themselves from being dislodged. But not everyone agrees that this majority status lives on forever.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans PANICKING After Federal Judge Shuts Down Florida Voter Suppression,"The Trump campaign is self destructing. If things get any worse between now and the election day, Trump could even be bringing down Congress. Republicans are in a panic and the only way out they see is voter suppression.Florida s Governor Rick Scott saw an opportunity when Hurricane Matthew hit. He refused to extend the registration deadline past 5:00 on Monday (seriously, why would the cutoff be a month before the election anyway?). A federal judge put a quick stop to that, calling it  irrational.  The deadline is extended till Tuesday. Quite simply, it is wholly irrational in this instance for Florida to refuse to extend the voter registration deadline when the state already allows the governor to suspend or move the election date due to an unforeseen emergency,  (U.S. District Judge Mark) Walker wrote in a 16-page order.  If aspiring eligible Florida voters are barred from registering to vote, then those voters are stripped of one of our most precious freedoms. Source: TampaBay.comMore than that, Walker called the state s effort to block the vote  unconstitutional. The right to vote is a  precious  and  fundamental  right,  Walker wrote, quoting from an earlier case.It s expected that about 100,000 additional people will be registering between now and the deadline. This is especially bad for Republicans. Clinton is leading the race in Florida by a narrow three points, but between his offensive remarks toward women and the fact that it was revealed that Trump illegally did business with Cuba, his Florida support is quickly fading. Without Florida, Trump is almost assured of losing, while Clinton could still win the election while losing Florida. Those 100,000 people might represent about one percent of the Florida electorate, which might not sound like a lot, but in a race that s that close, in a perennial swing state, that could mean the difference between winning and losing.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images.",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 FACT CHECK: U.S. Intelligence PROVES Trump A Liar – He Knew About Russian Attacks,"Donald Trump seems to be willfully ignorant when it comes to a Russian cyber-security threat. He displayed this once again during the second presidential debate.Trump stated that he didn t know whether there was Russian involvement in regards to hacking and the election, but that s an outright lie. U.S. intelligence has been briefing him on this very subject.According to NBC News: A senior U.S. intelligence official assured NBC News that cybersecurity and the Russian government s attempts to interfere in the 2016 election have been briefed to, and discussed extensively with, both parties  candidates, surrogates and leadership, since mid-August.  To profess not to know at this point is willful misrepresentation,  said the official.  The intelligence community has walked a very thin line in not taking sides, but both candidates have all the information they need to be crystal clear. Thus proving, without a doubt, that Trump either has amnesia or willingly lied during the debate regarding cyber-security and Russia.During the debate Trump professed: I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are   [Hillary Clinton] doesn t know if it s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. Trump literally brought it back to himself that Hillary talking about Russia s hacking is all about him. He needs to realize that Hillary brought it up to express the very critical point of increasing cyber-security. You know, like an actual leader.In fact, going beyond the intelligence briefings that he is undoubtedly privy to, the U.S. Intelligence community made this statement public for all of us to know: The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. So, this begs the question: Why is Trump either ignoring this issue or trying to protect Russia?Hillary brought up the fact that Trump may have Russian business ties, but we wouldn t know because he won t release his taxes. Trump has already boasted how much he loves Russian President Vladimir Putin, and this blatant lie during the debate definitely seems suspect.In fact, according to the Washington Post: There is strong evidence that Trump s businesses have received significant funding from Russian investors. Most notably, Trump s son Donald Trump Jr. made that very claim at a real estate conference in New York in 2008, saying  Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.  Donald Trump Jr. added,  we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. Which leads many to believe that Trump s business ties may be the reason for his willful ignorance when it comes to cyber-security and Russia.We would definitely know more if the Republican candidate released his taxes. However, knowing they ll likely be damaging, he ll probably keep those pretty close to his orange chest.Watch this report via NBC News regarding the hacks:Featured Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" BREAKING: Trump’s Taj Mahal SHUTS DOWN, Thousands Of Jobs Lost (DETAILS)","Donald Trump called the Atlantic City casino that he is so fond of, the Taj Mahal, the  eighth wonder of the world.  Now, the joint is shutting down   likely for good. The shutdown comes after more than 100 days of striking on the part of union workers from the luxury hotel and casino. As negotiations went from difficult to impossible, it became official: there s no going back, and the Taj Mahal is closing.This really isn t surprising, considering that Trump is the king of bankruptcy, and has declared himself bankrupt four times. Despite his own ridiculous record, Trump told the Associated Press with regards to the casino s closing that there was  no reason  for it to close. However, he also says it will cost too much to re-open, so it s done.However, Trump s billionaire buddy, Carl Icahn, who operated the Taj Mahal, just might be using the cold months to do some negotiating in an effort to save the place and re-open it. This is a theory that the union president, Bob McDevitt, is running on. According to McDevitt, the re-opening after renovations and other improvements is a  strong possibility. The Taj Mahal s closing will cost Atlantic City 3,000 jobs, bringing to the total to 11,000 jobs lost as a result of casino closings in the last two years. However, the workers who are on strike seem optimistic, despite the loss of their jobs and many admittedly being in financial trouble with the holidays coming. Tina Condos, who served cocktails at Trump s joint, says: We stood up to a billionaire and told him we wouldn t take it. I hope it gives him pause before he tries to come in and do this to anyone else. We feel like we succeeded here. Rose Hall, who took care of the rooms at the adjoining hotel, says: I gave most of my adult life to this place. I had to pay for health care out of my own pocket, and if you don t think that s expensive, you haven t looked. I lost my fiancee to cancer just when medical insurance came off the table for us.I m angry about what s happened, but I m not sad about what we did. I m at peace with myself. The last word on the situation from the point of view of the union workers  president, Bob McDevitt is that the workers were in the midst of their Popeye moment:  That s all I can stands; I can t stands no more.  For the first time in 30 years, workers stood up to Carl Icahn and made him throw in the towel. Well, good on these workers, and may they find other means of employment soon.Featured image via Bobby Bank/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Paul Ryan And Trump Go Head-To-Head As GOP Civil War Brews,"It s no secret that House Speaker Paul Ryan only grudgingly accepted Donald Trump as the GOP nominee. After all, Trump has made Ryan s life a living hell for the last year and a half, as he has repeatedly been forced to defend, explain away, and distance himself from Trump s inexcusable behavior in any number of directions. This time, though, it seems that Ryan has had enough.Of course, we re all aware of the extraordinarily lewd tape of Trump boasting of sexual assault on an Access Hollywood bus with the then-host of the show, Billy Bush. As if that weren t enough to make Paul Ryan s head explode over the weekend, there s the fact that Trump kicked off the second presidential debate not only with that tape as the scandalous backdrop, but also by digging up women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct of one kind or another in the 1990 s, or accused Hillary Clinton of threatening them into silence. After that gutter-level nonsense from his nominee, Ryan held a conference call with elected with Republicans with one instruction and one instruction only: to save their own asses. Don t let Trump drag them down and make them lose their seats. Further, Ryan himself will not be campaigning with Trump, and he will not be defending anymore of Trump s antics.Because Trump is a thin-skinned, bullying, sniveling little boy in a dirty old man s body, he could not resist going after Ryan on Twitter. Trump tweeted: Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not spend his time fighting Republican nominee. Here is the tweet:Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2016When asked about Trump s childish tweeting, one of Ryan s spokeswomen completely avoided Trump, saying: The speaker is going to spend the next month focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities in order to advance our  Better Way  agenda. Ryan, of course, is in a tough spot of his own making. He, Mitch McConnell, and all the rest of the GOPers who lined up behind Trump had to know that something of this nature was coming. Now, the whole party has the stench of the racist, misogynist, all-around bigoted pig that is Donald Trump.Time to cash in your life insurance policy and make some funeral arrangements, GOP.

 WATCH: Pat Robertson Gets INCREDIBLY Offensive In Full-Throated Defense Of Trump,"How much more depraved does a so-called pastor have to get before people acknowledge that he is not a real Christian?Because one would think that conservative  Christians  of all people would be absolutely opposed to Donald Trump after his lewd comments about groping women came to light on Friday.But evangelical leaders are willing to abandon their own supposed values and continue supporting Trump as long as it means Hillary Clinton does not become president.Family Research Council head Tony Perkins made that clear on Saturday when he STILL voiced support for Trump despite his  grab them by the p*ssy  remark. My personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values, it is based upon shared concerns about issues such as: justices on the Supreme Court that ignore the Constitution, America s continued vulnerability to Islamic terrorists and the systematic attack on religious liberty that we ve seen in the last 7 1/2 years,  Perkins said.Ralph Reed of Faith and Freedom Coalition basically said the same thing. Voters of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life, defend religious freedom, create jobs, and oppose the Iran nuclear deal. Ten-year-old tapes of private conversation with a television talk show host rank very low on their hierarchy of concerns. In other words, Trump could sexually assault all the women he wants and still be supported by conservative  Christian  leaders.And that includes 700 Club preacher Pat Robertson, who called Trump s behavior  macho  while continuing to endorse him for president. A guy does something 11 years ago, it was a conversation in Hollywood where he s trying to look like he s macho,  Robertson said on Monday.  And 11 years after that they surface it from The Washington Post or whatever, bring it out within 30 days or so of the election and this is supposed to be the death blow and everybody writes him off,  Okay, he s dead, now you ve got to get out of the way and let Mike Pence run the campaign. Robertson proceeded to declare Trump the winner of Sunday night s debate and called him  a Phoenix  rising from the ashes of an imploded campaign.Here s the video via YouTube.These hypocrites have been whining for years about how America needs a president who shares their so-called biblical values, but now they couldn t care less about those values as long as they can put a puppet in the White House who will rubber stamp their extreme religious agenda and force it upon the nation, even if the candidate they want is totally unfit for the office. These people are NOT Christians. They merely used religion to gain power and wealth and if conservatives actually had spines they would toss these pretenders out on their asses for disgracing the church.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Trump Campaign CAUGHT Paying Off Hillary-Hating Sexual Assault Victim (DETAILS),"If you wanted to see how low the Trump campaign would go to win, look no further than the stunt they pulled at the second presidential debate. For weeks the Trump campaign had been hinting they would invite Bill Clinton s alleged  victims  to the debates, but they teetered when GOP establishment shut them down.Well, at the second debate, they did just that. They invited four women, including Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick, to sit front and center as the two candidates squared off.One victim, however, wasn t a victim of Bill Clinton. She, Kathy Shelton, was the victim of Thomas Alfred Taylor, a rapist Hillary Clinton was assigned to represent in the 1970s.Clinton represented her client, begrudgingly and reluctantly, but had to uphold her oath as an attorney to represent her client to the best of her ability. It worked.Yet Shelton still blames Clinton, accusing her of crossing the ethical boundaries beholden to an attorney (she didn t   or she would have been disbarred). So what did the Trump campaign do? They paid Shelton $2,500 to record an in-depth interview with her regarding her experiences with Hillary.The money was funneled by Roger Stone, the insane and graphically vile Trump ally, through his PAC, Committee to Restore America s Greatness.So now the Trump campaign is buying off Hillary haters and coordinating directly with PACs.According the Associated Press:Stone has arranged to pay other women critical of the Clintons.Earlier this year, Stone sought to raise money to pay off the mortgage of Kathleen Willey, who accused Bill Clinton of making unwanted sexual advances toward her during her time as a volunteer in his White House in the 1990s. Stone claimed in an online video interview that Trump had personally contributed to the fund.Trump s campaign has not endorsed Stone s political action committee, and has sent the group a cease and desist letter. The campaign has denied that Trump gave money to Willey s mortgage fund.Classy, Republicans. Real classy. Buying victims of childhood sex abuse to smear a qualified woman while their own candidate admits, on tape, to sexually assaulting women. Republicans have forfeited the right to call themselves the party of family values and morality.Kathy Shelton is once again being victimized, this time by a national political party who can t win on ideas, so they have to win on disgusting tactics like this.How much lower will they sink?Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Sworn Affidavit PROVES Clinton ‘Victim’ Wasn’t Assaulted Or Harassed,"Donald Trump thought bringing Juanita Broaddrick to the second presidential debate would be a good idea.For people who might have forgotten, in the early 1990s, when President Bill Clinton was running his first campaign, Broaddrick went public with her accusations that Clinton had raped her in the 1970s while running for governor and that Hillary had intimidated her into silence.As expected, it created a media circus. No such accusation had ever been thrown at a presidential candidate in such a manner.However, years after the accusations surfaced, Broaddrick, in a sworn affidavit in December 1998, during the Paula Jones scandal, admitted that President Clinton had never made any un-warranted sexual advances towards here.As obtained by the Washington Post:3. I met President Clinton more than twenty years ago through family friends. Our introduction was not arranged or facilitated, in any way, by the Arkansas State Police. I have never been an Arkansas state employee or a federal employee. I have never discussed with Mr. Clinton the possibility of state or federal employment nor has he offered me any such position. I have had no further relations with him for the past (15) years.4. During the 1992 Presidential campaign there were unfounded rumors and stories circulated that Mr. Clinton had made unwelcome sexual advances toward me in the late seventies. Newspaper and tabloid reporters hounded me and my family, seeking corroboration of these tales. I repeatedly denied the allegations and requested that my family s privacy be respected. These allegations are untrue and I had hoped that they would no longer haunt me, or cause further disruption to my family. 5.   . Specifically, I do not have any information to offer regarding a nonconsensual or unwelcome sexual advance by Mr. Clinton, any discussion offer or provision of state or federal employment or advancement in exchange for sexual conduct, or any use of state troopers to procure women for sex. Requiring my testimony at a deposition in this matter would cause unwarranted attorney s fees and costs, disruption to my life and constitute an invasion of my right to privacy. For these reasons, I have asked my attorney to advise Ms. Jones s counsel that there is no truth to the rumors they are pursuing and to provide her counsel with this sworn affidavit.Known as Jane Doe #5 at the time, Broaddrick admitted, to law enforcement and to the courts of this country (six years after the initial accusation), that President Clinton never raped her.And if Bill didn t rape her, how would Hillary Clinton have intimidated her into silence?Seems as though the Trump campaign didn t so their research. Sad!Considering Broaddrick lied, could one see why Hillary Clinton wouldn t take too lightly to such awful and shameful accusations that were never true to begin with? That s why women take her side on these issues.The fact that Donald Trump used a liar as a prop to deflect from his own sexual prowess shows how desperate and pathetic him and his whole campaign is.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" President Obama BLASTS ‘Insecure’ Trump, Makes It Clear Trump Is Unfit (VIDEO)","Donald Trump fell on his face repeatedly during Sunday night s debate. Perhaps he was too busy thinking about what President Obama said about him only hours earlier.The Republican nominee is under tremendous fire and his campaign is imploding after some lewd comments about groping women dropped like a bombshell on Friday. Trump and his team have been scrambling ever since while Republicans have been running as far away as they can from the blast radius.During an event in Chicago in support of Rep. Tammy Duckworth s Senate bid, President Obama finally chimed in on the disgusting remarks, which was perfect timing considering the second presidential debate between Hillary and Trump was only a few hours away from commencing in St. Louis. One of the most disturbing things about this election is just the unbelievable rhetoric coming at the top of the Republican ticket,  Obama said of the remarks.  I don t need to repeat it. There are children in the room. President Obama was clearly referencing Trump s 2005 remarks, which included a declaration that he is so famous that he just walks up to women and  grabs them by the p*ssy. Demeaning women, degrading women, but also minorities, immigrants, people of other faiths, mocking the disabled, insulting our troops, insulting our veterans. That tells you a couple things,  Obama continued.  It tells you that he s insecure enough that he pumps himself up by putting other people down not a character trait that I would advise for somebody in the Oval Office. It tells you that he doesn t care much about the basic values that we try to impart to our kids. It tells you he d be careless with the civility and the respect that a real, vibrant democracy requires. Here s the video via CNN:So maybe Donald Trump had a hard time during the debate last night partly because he was seething from being burned by President Obama. Regardless of why Trump got his ass handed to him on the debate stage again, the fact remains that he is unfit to be president and President Obama perfectly made it clear that insulting a great majority of Americans is the biggest reason to keep Trump out of the White House.America needs a president who respects all of the people, not someone who has disrespected more than half of them.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: New Poll Shows HUGE Lead For Hillary As Trump’s Downward Spiral Continues,"With 28 days left to go until election day, a new poll from NBC/Wall Street Journal, a gold-standard in polling, shows Hillary Clinton posting an unprecedented double-digit lead over Donald Trump.The first major poll since the revelations exposed in a recent audio leak   in which he boasted about sexually assaulting women by grabbing their genitals without consent   shows that not only has Clinton posted a 14 point lead in a head-to-head contest, she has opened up an 11-point lead in the four-way race with the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and the Green Party s nominee, Jill Stein.Because of Trump s admission to sexually assaulting women doesn t bode well for voters, the House is now in play   something that no one, just one week ago, thought would be possible. Forty-nine percent of voters want to see a Democratic Congress while 42 percent want to see a GOP Congress. That s a three point uptick for Democrats.Forty-one percent of voters called the tapes  completely unacceptable  and 52 percent said it should be an issue in the campaign.While Republicans try desperately to write it off as simple  locker room talk,  the electorate isn t buying it and they are actually, reasonably so, disgusted by it.The poll also shows that Clinton has opened up a 21 point lead with women. That is a nine point difference than it was in mid-September when it was a smaller (yet still significant) 12 point lead.Remember: John McCain lost the female vote by 13 points, and Mitt Romney lost by 11. Both times women made up 53 percent of the total electorate. You can t lose female voters this  bigly  and win a national election.If Trump continues to lose by a whopping 21 points, he s absolutely done.With future tapes on the horizon, the Trump campaign has pretty much run out of time. Republicans are abandoning him, the electorate is abandoning him, and his campaign is crashing and burning.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Dan Rather BURIES Trump In Epic Post-Debate Analysis That Everyone Should See,"This is why we miss Dan Rather at the CBS News desk.At a time when the media often fails to dig deep and ask the hard hitting questions all for the sake of ratings, at least we still can rely on Dan Rather to deliver an analysis that makes people think.After the debate on Sunday night, the legendary newsman delivered a damning criticism of the Republican nominee and warned Americans of the dire consequences of this election. I am not sure it is possible to truly put into words what we witnessed tonight,  Rather wrote.  This election has long since passed the stage of rationality and reason, the realm of the written page, and into the territory of the heart and spirit, where emotions swirl that we cannot fully distill into coherent sentences and paragraphs. But I will humbly try Rather launched into talking about the Roman Empire and the barbarism that eventually led to its downfall. The debate last night was like watching a fight to the death between gladiators at the Colosseum.  I had a sense we could, if we are not vigilant, fall into a similar downward spiral,  Rather noted.But Rather was pleased with how the moderators did their job, praising Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz for demanding specifics from both candidates.Trump, of course, whined about the tough questions and that resulted in a meltdown that lasted throughout the evening as Trump preferred personal smears instead of actually giving the American people an idea of what his policies are and how he will enact them. Dan Rather definitely noticed the differences between the two presidential contenders.Trump went on the offensive, as advertised, drilling down to an attack on Bill Clinton. It was a strategy that was all Trump. And HIllary Clinton responded with a volley of all the other insulting statements and lies by Trump over the course of the election season. As Trump preened, paced and swayed, Clinton s steely face spoke volumes. As Trump stood, looming over Clinton, threatening her with a special prosecutor and even imprisonment, the optics of the GOP nominee could be seen as either that of a schoolyard bully or a determined pugilist depending on your point of view. Clinton was better answering questions directly and better at laying out what she would like to do as President. Trump was more determined to levy personal attacks to put Clinton on defensive, especially in the early going.Clinton engaged mostly with the audience and moderators. Donald Trump addressed her directly with hand gestures and eye contact. When she spoke, he sometimes stood pacing, or passively, gripping his chair. When he spoke, he often tried to tar his opponent with guilt by association   calling into question Clinton s  friends  on taxes in particular and referring to Clinton s husband to avoid the glare of his own misconduct. It seems that Trump does everything he can to avoid personal culpability or responsibility. He argues that his faults are not so great because Clinton and her associates have done much worse   his words are not so dangerous because  locker room  talk has long been excused for men. Clinton called for an apology to the many Trump has spoken ill of. None was forthcoming. I can t see any of that moving the needle compared to the tsunami that has engulfed the race in the past few days.In conclusion, Rather talked about the need for all of us to be engaged if we want to end this national nightmare and get back to the business of dealing with our problems with reasonable solutions. We have serious problems facing our nation, and our world,  Rather wrote.Our ship of state must be prepared to navigate the perilous shoals of our complicated world   and yet I feel tonight as if we have been hijacked into an alternate universe. This national nightmare will end one way or another and we will awaken to the same world from which we have been so disengaged. That is our challenge and it is a challenge from which none of us can opt out.Here s the full post via Facebook.Donald Trump must be stopped before our country turns into a barbaric nation that is primed to fall like Rome did. Hate, ignorance, violence, and fear will not make America great again. It will be our end. And that can only be prevented by the American people on November 8th by making sure Trump nevers sees the inside of the White House.Featured Image: Larry Busacca/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ivanka Trump Just Admitted That She LIKES Her Dad Calling Her A ‘Piece Of A**’ (IMAGE),"Now, something is definitely off with Trump family values, and what they seem to deem appropriate within the realm of human decency, and well, incest.After remarks were released highlighting Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s ongoing crush on his daughter Ivanka, where he told Howard Stern that it s fine to call her a  piece of a**,  something even weirder just happened   Ivanka literally  liked  it.A screengrab of Ivanka s Twitter page was captured revealing that she  liked  the Huffington Post article revealing this new tidbit of information.Check it out for yourself here:Ivanka Trump Twitter screencap via BuzzfeedIt was also captured via mobile:OMG pic.twitter.com/EReJ5pkHnc  andrew kaczynski (@KFILE) October 10, 2016The  like  or rather  favorite  has now been unliked, but that doesn t make it any less weird.You d think that a daughter would be utterly mortified that her dad openly has a crush on his daughter, but clearly that is not the case here. I mean, maybe she thought it was funny, but guess what, Ivanka, it s not. Especially since Donald Trump is an admitted sexual predator as seen and heard in the leaked Access Hollywood tapes.After Donald Trump loses in November to Hillary Clinton, it won t be surprising if we see a new reality television show released called  Trump Family Values,  and have our barf bags at the ready.Featured Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Running Scared As Trump Threatens Those Who Dump Him With Political Doom,"Republicans are caught between a rock and a hard place and Democrats are poised to take advantage of the chaos.The avalanche that buried the Republican Party on Friday is causing mass panic among GOP candidates up and down the 2016 ballot.Trump s vulgar remarks about groping women has resulted in many Republicans withdrawing their support of his presidential campaign. But whether they stick with him or turn their backs on him, it s a double-edged sword that is making Republicans bleed out with under a month to go before Election Day.The Republican nominee has been a toxic force ever since he threw his hat into the ring over a year ago, and while that has hurt Republicans among independent and moderate Republican voters in addition to the many groups Trump has insulted, Republicans who are just now running away from Trump have angered the conservative base that somehow still supports him.And the political consequences could cut deep if Trump has his way. Even if he loses in November, Trump could still bring many Republicans down with him, especially after this threat he posted on Twitter.So many self-righteous hypocrites. Watch their poll numbers   and elections   go down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2016Just in case you re confused, that s Trump attacking the Republicans who have denounced him since Friday s bombshell, and there is no doubt that Trump s supporters are going to remember who betrayed them when it s time to vote.Trump even escalated the threat by instructing his team to launch the attack.According to the New York Times,In a set of talking points sent to his supporters Sunday morning, Mr. Trump s campaign urged them to attack turncoat Republicans as  more concerned with their political future than they are about the country. As we all know, Trump s team has received a lot of television time this year, which means any Republican who has distanced themselves from Trump is about to get a whole lot of negative press.And that s really bad news for Republicans, because as the Times further reports,  much of the party appeared to be in a state of paralysis, uncertain of how to achieve political distance from Mr. Trump without enraging millions of voters who remained loyal to his campaign. Specifically, Republicans now fear losing both houses of Congress, which would be a historic political victory for Democrats at a time when gerrymadering basically guaranteed that the GOP would at least hold onto power over the House of Representatives.Steven Law, a longtime lieutenant of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said the party had descended into chaos. The Republican Party is caught in a theater fire; people are just running to different exits as fast as they can,  said Mr. Law, who now heads the  super PAC  American Crossroads.One member of the House Republican leadership, conceding its majority was now in jeopardy, compared the situation to the 2006 scandal involving a Florida congressman s inappropriate conduct with congressional pages. If that scandal was a house fire, this lawmaker said, Mr. Trump had brought on the political equivalent of a nuclear attack.Democrats see this as a major opportunity to seek wins in Republican leaning states such as Indiana and Georgia, and even wins in red states like Arizona. If successful, we could be seeing a reversal of the 2010 midterm election that swept Republicans into office.Should it come to pass that Republicans lose across the board on November 8th, we could be finally seeing the last gasp of Republican reliance upon it s conservative base, which means Republicans will have to move towards the center if they want to be politically relevant again.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 POLL: HUGE Majority Of Americans Say Trump DOES NOT Respect Women,"Donald Trump, at the second presidential debate, invoked laughs when he claimed to respect women, and that no one respects women more than him.There s a reason people laughed   they don t believe him, and for good reason.In a new poll from NBC/SurveyMonkey shows that a huge majority of the American people, 63 percent, do not believe Trump respects women, compared to 36 percent who said he does.When it comes to female voters, nearly 70 percent responded that Trump does not respect women, up from 64 percent pre-leaked audio.Even more telling is the difference in this question pre-tape leak. Before the bombshell audio recording leaked, 55 percent (still a majority) said Trump did not respect women. Since the recording leaked, we ve seen an eight percent increase in those that agree that Donald Trump is a sexist pig.But the poll also took into account Trump s post-first debate meltdown over Alicia Machado, in which he degraded the weight of the former Miss Universe and asked voters to watch her sex tape (which doesn t exist).Donald Trump currently trails Hillary Clinton in what s being seen as the biggest gender gap in presidential politics.The fact that Trump wrote off the leaked audio as  locker-room talk  multiple times (and denied that he said the things he did), shows that he really doesn t care about the issues that women care about. And it shows that he is unable to take responsibility for his actions. One can simply say  I made a mistake and I m sorry,  but it takes a real man to fully own up to what was said   and Trump didn t do that.John McCain and Mitt Romney lost their respective elections, in big part, because of the gender gap. If Trump thinks he can win a national election in 29 days with the historic gap he has now he s got another thing coming his way.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jerry Springer Reacts To Trump’s Debate Performance And It’s BRILLIANT (VIDEO/TWEETS),"If you watched the second presidential debate last night, you know that there were several cringeworthy moments, most of them created by Republican nominee Donald Trump. One of the most noteworthy of them was when the business mogul threw his vice president, Mike Pence, under the bus by disagreeing with Pence s stance on how America should respond to the war in Syria:[ad3media campaign= 1103 ]The moment shocked everyone watching, and was the perfect representation of just what a disaster the Trump-Pence ticket is. To make matters worse, this is just one amongst a long list of things Trump and Pence have disagreed about! Jerry Springer, the host of  The Jerry Springer Show  said it better than any of us could have when he weighed in on this awkward debate moment: While I may not be able to moderate a debate, sounds like Mike Pence and Donald Trump might need to come on my show to talk things out. Seriously   and Springer s tweet about Trump-Pence couldn t be any more fitting than at this moment, when Pence basically refused to defend Trump over the lewd misogynistic comments that were discovered in a recently leaked audio tape.Trump s entire campaign has gone on like a reality TV show, so it s not a stretch to say that Trump wouldn t feel right at home on Springer s show. And according to previous tweets from Springer, the talk show host already knows this:TwitterSpringer, who has fiercely endorsed Hillary Clinton, has been taking Trump and the GOP to task on social media, and it s pretty awesome. Springer also made sure to bring those who support Trump into the mix of insults:TwitterTwitterTwitterConsidering that Trump is a serial rapist who wants to bang his daughter and can t agree with his most important team member, Springer s show might be the ONLY place Trump and his weird, volatile campaign belongs!Featured image via Stephen Lovekin and Scott Olson / Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NYT Fact-Checked Donald In Real-Time And It Was GLORIOUS,"The second presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Sunday night was bizarre to say the least. Donald lurked behind Clinton onstage, lied and even threatened to jail the Democratic presidential nominee. The debate occurred during Donald s most recent scandal in which a tape was released showing Trump casually discussing predatory behavior towards women. That issue was brought up during the debate. The lies, though, were abundant.Reporters for The New York Times fact-checked the statements made by Clinton and  Trump during the debate and the results are pretty damning for the GOP presidential nominee.The Times rated the following statement by Trump to be  Just flat wrong, :  Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton has never used the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism. In June, Hillary Clinton broke from President Obama and used the term  radical Islamism  to describe an attack on an Orlando night club.  Whether you call it radical jihadism or radical Islamism, I m happy to say either. I think they mean the same thing,  she said on CNN in June.But Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have argued that using that term plays into the hands of the Islamic State.  We are not at war with Islam,  Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday night.Hillary Clinton  said that she had helped eight million children obtain health coverage, Sept. 11 responders receive medical care and children get safer medicines. She can back it up,  the Times notes.Lawmakers of both parties who led the fight for the Children s Health Insurance Program in 1997 said then that Hillary Clinton had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up support for it.She was a tenacious advocate for legislation that provided medical monitoring and treatment to emergency workers and cleanup workers at the site of the World Trade Center attacks. She was also a leading proponent of the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, which has increased the study of drugs in children.After Trump said Clinton wants  amnesty for everybody, come on in, come on over,  the Times said that s  not her position. Naturally, the Benghazi attacks came up during the debate.Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton ignored 600 requests for increased security from J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya, and communicated only with Sidney Blumenthal.That little nugget was rated  extremely misleading. On Trump s taxes, which he refuses to release:Mr. Trump admitted that he used a $916 million loss declared on his 1995 tax returns to avoid paying federal income taxes. But he refused to say how many years he paid no income tax and simultaneously claimed to have paid a  tremendous  amount of taxes.The Times responded to that with,  More questions than answers. It s impossible to know exactly what Donald J. Trump has or has not done with regard to taxes. He s the only presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his tax returns. The $916 million loss declared on 1995 tax returns obtained by The New York Times could have allowed Mr. Trump to avoid legally paying income taxes for up to 18 years. There is evidence,  the Times reports to Clinton saying Trump supported the Iraq war before it began.While one statement by Hillary was deemed  Misleading,  the lies told last night belong to Donald J. Trump.

 Trump BUSTED Checking Out Clinton’s Ass During Debate (VIDEO),"What in the hell was Donald Trump doing? No, I m not talking about his threat to jail his opponent if he is elected, his lackluster explanation for his claim that he walks around sexually assaulting women and getting away with it because he s rich, or any of the many, many things he said and did that virtually ensured that Hillary Clinton will be the next President of the United States   I m talking about a video clip posted to Twitter that appears to show Trump   well, see for yourself.What exactly is Trump trying to do here while Hillary is answering a question. #debate pic.twitter.com/caXu9ZBVrE  Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) October 10, 2016Yes, in the few-second clip, Trump saunters over behind Clinton, his eyes directed toward her rear-end. He then abruptly lifts his head upward after, well, apparently taking a brief look at the ass of woman who will be curb-stomping him at the polls American History -style (except the Nazis are on his side) in November.Sure, there could be another explanation. Maybe he saw a penny, thought about picking it up, then realized that pennies are the currency of the poor. Was there a ball of lint on the former Secretary of State s back he considered picking off, but did not want to explain why he had just touched her abruptly? Or was he just doing what he does best and being a letch?You might be thinking,  This seems a bit far-fetched. There must be another explanation.  Yeah, well so did feeling up his daughter onstage, but he covered that pretty well during the Republican National Convention   and he is, after all, the guy who inspired garage band names everywhere with the phrase  grab  em by the pussy. Watch Trump feel up his daughter below, because why the f*ck not at this point?Vote on November 8   and if you need any help deciding for whom you should vote, go for the one who isn t going to court just after the election for the alleged rape of a 13-year-old girl.Featured image via screengrab",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Mike Pence Cancels ANOTHER Trump Event, Campaign Imploding (IMAGE)","Donald Trump s lewd comments about sexually assaulting women in a 2005 leaked audio tape are wreaking havoc on his presidential campaign. Not only are prominent Republicans distancing themselves from him, but even his own running mate, Mike Pence, looks like he s about to jump ship.First, Pence pulled out of a Wisconsin rally, where Donald Trump said Pence would be taking the place of House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also canceled following the tape s release. Now, Pence has canceled a New Jersey fundraiser for Trump that was supposed to take place today   signaling a trend of upcoming disruptions in Trump s campaign schedule. There were supposed to be 250 people at this event, who all paid $50 to attend.This isn t surprising, considering how strongly Pence opposed Trump s disrespectful, misogynistic comments in the 2005 recording. Trump s running mate released a statement that said: As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the eleven-year-old video released yesterday. I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them. This cancellation is even more questionable considering that on Trump s campaign website, a message showed that all Mike Pence events had been canceled:Trump website The site was later updated with two new events for today   in North Carolina instead of New Jersey   but this is certainly a strange move for a campaign. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks has not yet returned comment on whether Pence would actually be attending the North Carolina events   we wouldn t be surprised if he skipped those, too.It could very well be that Trump s degrading, rape-like comments about how he interacts with women were the final straw for the Republican party, and the final straw for Pence. It s bad enough that Pence and Trump have previously disagreed on several policies and issues   but now it seems that Trump has crossed the line and Pence can t stand to represent him any longer.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren Slapped The Hell Out Of Trump While He Was Busy Losing To Clinton (TWEETS),"While Hillary Clinton was busy tearing Donald Trump orange limb from orange limb on the debate stage, Elizabeth Warren made the world her stage as she masterfully kicked him while he was down via Twitter.Trump didn t have a good night Sunday. Not only did he fail completely to  explain away his open admission that he sexually assaults women by grabbing them  by the pussy  (and gets away with it because he s rich), but Trump managed to cause the room to erupt in laughter when he called himself a  gentleman,  openly admitted that he doesn t pay his taxes, and even threatened to jail his opponent if he is elected because some people want him to.Warren hit him HARD on taxes:.@realDonaldTrump's tax plan is to cut taxes for rich & powerful guys like Donald Trump & leave everyone else behind. #debate  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 10, 2016.@realDonaldTrump is PROUD that he doesn't pay his taxes. He thinks he's smart   and you're stupid for paying yours. #debate  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 10, 2016 and reminded us that no matter how much distance the GOP tries to create, they are still blocking Obama s Supreme Court nominee so Trump can nominate one of his choosing:Remember: @SenateGOP are running away from @realDonaldTrump this weekend, but they're holding a Supreme Court seat hostage for him. #debate  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 10, 2016She even agreed with Trump on something I am sure we can all agree upon   Clinton is a fighter:I agree with @realDonaldTrump: @HillaryClinton is a fighter.

 Melania Quite Possibly Tried To Troll The Press With Her Style Of Blouse At The Debate,"Melania Trump, standing by her man despite being hurt and disappointed in her husband for bragging up a storm about sexually assaulting women, appeared at the 2nd presidential debate looking radiant in a modest, flowing, pink Gucci blouse. There s a small problem, though: The blouse is, literally, called a  Pussybow silk-crepe de chine shirt. That s according to Gucci itself. Their description says: A pussybow blouse is one of the prettiest ways to embrace Gucci s new-found eclecticism. This fuchsia-pink design is cut in Italy from silk-georgette, and detailed with softly gathered shoulders and buttoned cuffs to maximise the vintage vibes. Tuck it into a knife-pleated skirt, finishing with statement accessories.

Someone probably should have warned her, though, because the last 48 hours have been very painful for women all across America who actually have been grabbed that way. The right s defense of those indefensible words just makes it so much worse.Right now, there are definitely some who would call anyone who thinks this was tone-deaf  overly sensitive,  and worse, because of course they would. However, as the wife of the man in the hot seat for those comments, she could have stood to wear something else.Trump has been in a lot of trouble for bragging about sexually assaulting women, saying things like,  I just start kissing them. It s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don t even wait,  and  Just grab them by the pussy. Anything you want.  People bring up Bill Clinton s escapades, but that s nothing more than a deflection.Those words aren t the words of a simply uncouth man. Those are the words of a sexual predator   someone who believes that women want him to take them sexually because he s a star, and who has no compunction whatsoever about acting on that thought.The Trump campaign insists this wasn t intentional on Melania s part. However, it could be seen as, at a minimum, trolling the press in an attempt to prove she s standing by her husband.Featured image by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Trump’s Campaign Manager Says She Might Leave The Campaign (VIDEO),"There may be trouble in paradise amid the folks over at the Donald Trump campaign.

Conway responded: I m with the campaign to the bitter end . unless Seemingly taken aback like the rest of us at home, Matthews presses Conway: Unless what? Conway quickly scrambled together an answer.Then, when pressed on it later by Rachel Maddow, Conway put together a reason that involved if her family needed her, and not at all around the fact that her candidate is a racist and misogynistic pervert.The fact that she said  unless  is absolutely telling of how she may feel about her current position within the campaign.Only time will tell to see if Conway stands by her candidate   or not   until the bitter end, but one thing is for certain, it s likely getting harder for her by the day.Watch Conway admit she may leave here: Trump s campaign manager @KellyannePolls just admitted she may leave the campaign. #Trump #debate pic.twitter.com/WwLhjuXSia  Sarah Wood (@SarahWoodwriter) October 10, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Said He’s A ‘Gentleman’ At The Debate And Everyone Laughed At Him (VIDEO),"After a voter asked a question at the second presidential debate regarding Obamacare, Anderson Cooper was forced to interrupt Donald Trump to remind him it was Hillary Clinton s turn to respond first. Of course, the debate was going so well for Clinton by that point that she just wanted to sit back, relax, and let him talk. If he wants to start, he can start,  Clinto said, failing to mask the mirthful tone hiding underneath her normally serious demeanor. No, go ahead,  Trump, who had just finished defending his comments about grabbing women by their  wherevers. No,  go ahead Donald,  she replied. No, I m a gentleman, Hillary, go ahead. The audience, of course, could not contain themselves as the entire room erupted in laughter at Trump s  gentleman  claim.Trump, of course, habitually insults women with whom he disagrees, making fun of their looks, their faces, and their weight rather than addressing actual issues   and, yes, it is completely laughable to think that he could possibly be considered a gentleman.Trump himself said it best when he was asked about whether or not he is a gentleman on Howard Stern:  I can t say that.

 Trump Just Threatened To Jail Hillary If He’s Elected – Then She Blasted His Orange Face Off (VIDEO),"Well, he said it. Trump s fans have long been chanting  lock her up  at his rallies   despite that Clinton has not committed a single jailable offense. But they re sure that it happened, and their candidate took their conspiracy theories and irrational hatred mainstream during Sunday s sh*tshow of a presidential debate. I didn t think I would say this but I m going to say it,  Trump began.  If I win, I am going to instruct my Attorney General to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation Trump told Clinton that  in his opinion  the people at the FBI are furious with her because of the email nonscandal.  We re going to get a special prosecutor and we ;re going to look into it because you know what? People have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you have done,  he said.Clinton s face the entire time was priceless as we watched her choke back grins and laughter, at times finding it impossible to hide her mirth. At one point, her face kind of froze as she appeared to daydream about her first day in the Oval Office and one could even  see  thought bubbles appear over her head:  Madame President. President Hillary Clinton. Yeah. That s the ticket. Then, when it was her turn to respond, she dropped the hammer: Everything he just said is absolutely false but I m not surprised. Clinton once again reminded Americans that her website is serving as a fact-checking service for the night, calling the daunting task  impossible. It s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,  Clinton said before Trump shot back,  because you d be in jail. Remember to vote in November   otherwise, we get a President who believes his political opponents should be jailed without committing a crime.Watch it below:Featured image via Getty Images/Win McNamee",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 HOLY F*CK: Trump Had to Be Forced To Say He Hasn’t Sexually Assaulted Women (VIDEO),"At the second presidential debate, Donald Trump had a chance to address the controversy surrounding his claim that he greets seemingly every woman he meets by grabbing them  by the pussy.  To Trump, this was  locker room talk,  though I can t say I have ever been in a locker room in which anyone has bragged about sexually assaulting women. To the rest of us, it was a horrific reminder that the 2016 GOP nominee is exactly the sort of person to make creepy sexual remarks about his own daughter   a man who has been sued for  grabbing someone by the pussy  (the woman was branded a liar), who is being sued for the sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl, and who admitted he was attracted to 12-year-old Paris Hilton.Asked if The Donald had actually sexually assaulted women, he repeated that it was  locker room talk  (whatever that means), but was reticent to admit that he doesn t walk about grabbing women by the pussy   largely because, one can safely assume, he can not honestly say that he has not sexually assaulted a woman.  Sniffles  deflected to ISIS for a while before explaining that  it s just one of those things. Asked if he has ever kissed or groped a woman without her consent, Trump replied that he  has great respect for women  and that  nobody has more respect for women than he does. For the record, you re saying you never did that,  Anderson Cooper said, fishing for clarification. I ve said things, you hear these things I ve said, and I was embarrassed by it but I have tremendous respect for women and they have respect for me,  Trump said, once again evading the question. Have you ever done those things?  Cooper pressed, finally earning an offhanded  no I have not  from Trump before he went on to call Bill Clinton a rapist.Watch it below: ",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Hillary Just Responded To Trump’s Pre-Debate Bullsh*t On Twitter, And It’s EPIC (TWEET)","After the release of the videotape showing Trump not only use derogatory language about women, but also profess to be a sexual predator, we re starting to notice the Trump campaign in a bit of tailspin.Trump s getting so desperate, in fact, that he just dragged out some women who allege they re victims of sexual abuse from Bill Clinton. What people need to remember is that, no matter if any of those allegations are true, Bill is not who is running for president. Trump is acting out of fear because he knows he s about to have his orange ass handed to him.Hillary s Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri released the official statement from the Clinton campaign regarding Trump s desperation:The statement read: We re not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom. Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn t change that. If Donald Trump doesn t see that, that s his loss. As always, she s prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way. However, it was what Clinton tweeted next that shows us exactly why she will be the next President of the United States. Instead of jumping back at all the crazy that is Donald Trump, she instead tweets this:Remember. #Debate pic.twitter.com/rlMbTt5WwY  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 10, 2016Which is exactly what she will do.Donald Trump is currently self-destructing before our very eyes, and he has no idea what to do next.Hillary will stick to the issues and what s best for the nation as Trump takes the low road and tries to mudsling himself into the White House.This election has certainly been an interesting one, and something tells me it s only going to get worse before it gets better, and by  gets better  I mean, when Hillary wins on November 8th.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" There’s A Video Of Trump Saying The N-Word, And Here’s How Much It’ll Cost To Get It Released","The world was recently teased that there are worse tapes of Donald Trump saying vile things out there then  grab her by the pussy.  That teaser came from Bill Pruitt. Pritt was the producer of The Apprentice, a reality show starring Trump that was for millions of Americans their first encounter with the now Republican presidential nominee.Pruitt sent out a tweet saying,  I assure you: when it comes to the #trumptapes there are far worse. As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice I assure you: when it comes to the #trumptapes there are far worse. #justthebegininng  Bill Pruitt (@billpruitt) October 8, 2016Now it appears that at least one of those tapes features Trump saying the N-word. Whether one consider that worse or not would depend entirely on whether one despises Trump because he is a racist or whether they despise him because he is a violent misogynist. I prefer to loathe his existence for both equally. For those of you just itching to hear Trump to tear his past once again destroy his chances of winning the election, there s a problem. Apparently, the tapes are being held behind a legal wall. Mark Burnett is a producer on The Apprentice. He has threatened any leakers with the show that he will sue anyone who is caught revealing the tapes. According to Emmy-award winning producer Chris Nee, it ll cost anyone who leaks the tapes $5 million dollars. @mcuban the price is 5 million to cover the penalty fee. And we all get to hear him use the N word from what I hear https://t.co/IsmJvHHL1K  Chris Nee (@chrisdocnee) October 9, 2016 the price is 5 million to cover the penalty fee. And we all get to hear him use the N word from what I hear Apparently, there is some hope out there that we may get to hear those tapes anyway. David Brock, a Clinton backer has pledged to pay the penalty fees of anyone who can release those tapes, and it s like others would step forward as well. So please, if anyone has damning tapes of Trump from his time on the show, please release them.Featured image from Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Van Jones Unapologetically Calls Donald Trump A ‘Superpredator’: ‘He’s Confessing To Sexual Assault’ (VIDEO),"On Sunday, Van Jones appeared on CNN s State of the Union where he referred to Donald Trump as a  Superpredator.  The phrase is a racialized code word that was aimed at crystallizing the public s opinion to support tougher sentences for criminals in the 1990 s. Jones lambasted Trump for his violently misogynistic comments towards women.  I want to say a couple things. First of all, this is the law and order candidate,  Jones said to the show s panel.  Let s not forget, this is Mr. Law and Order, who is now on tape confessing to a crime. He s confessing to sexual assault. The problem isn t the talk, the problem isn t the bad words, the problem is the bad deeds. He s saying he feels he has the right as a star to sexually assault women. Jones then went on to recall the time that Trump worked to get five black boys charged with sexual assault. Those boys turned out to be innocent. They have become known as the Central Park Five. The irony of all this and how it relates to Trump s current situation was not lost on Jones.    Now, the irony here is this for me   this man came on to the scene politically in New York City attacking five innocent black boys accusing them of what? Sexual assault. He comes on the scene. He says these five boys committed sexual assault   and they were innocent. He never apologized! He said Mexican immigrants are rapists, sexual assaulters. It turns out the sexual assaulter, the superpredator is the man running for president! We have a superpredator named Donald Trump. I want to challenge the media now: put up the pictures of those five young innocent black boys and Donald Trump and ask America,  Who is a thug here? Who is a thug?  It s Donald Trump. Jones recently appeared in Netflix original documentary 13th. In the documentary, Jones explains how Trump has held consistently racist views that have been used to support mass incarceration efforts in the U.S. It is an excellent documentary that everyone in the U.S. absolutely MUST SEE.  As Jones explains in the interview and the film, Trump is a dangerous man who uses coded language to advance his racist agenda. He brags that he would have had five innocent boys executed for a crime they did not commit. At the time, Trump even paid top dollar for a full page ad urging New Yorkers to bring back the death penalty in order to have the Central Park Five be given a capital punishment sentence.

 WATCH: Chuck Todd HUMILIATES Rudy Giuliani After He Pathetically Defends Trump,"Appearing on NBC s Meet The Press Sunday morning, Rudy Giuliani continued his efforts to defend Donald Trump. With Trump s campaign falling apart and the rest of the GOP quickly abandoning their presidential nominee, Giulini has continued to stump for Trump despite the fact that Trump is now being skewered by both Democrats and Republicans over his violently misogynistic remarks regarding groping women.It didn t take very long for the show s host Chuck Todd to show what it means to be a friend of Trump at the moment. Giuliani, who recently defended Trump s  grab her by the pussy  comment by saying that  The fact is men, at times, talk like that,  was forced to listen to audio recordings where Trump used vile misogynistic language. Because his cognitive dissonance apparently knows no limits, Giuliani offered another pathetic attempt to defend Trump. Still, he wasn t running for president,  Giulini says.Todd responds perfectly saying: Oh, he wasn t running for president so it s OK to be a misogynist. He wasn t running for president so it s OK to make unwanted sexual advances? That s a good counterpoint to have on hand for the rest of the election. Assuming Trump doesn t drop out of the race, his campaign is going to desperately try to position him as a reformed sinner, to appeal to moderate Christian right. A critical demographic of consistent voters Trump needs in toss-up states.At that point, Giuliani tried desperately to pivot to talking about recently leaked portions of transcripts from paid speeches that Hillary Clinton gave. Todd then asks Giulini an excellent question that proves that Giuliani had just bit himself on the ass with that pivot attempt. If you believe that Hillary Clinton says one thing in private and that means what she really is, is what she is in private, should we assume what Donald Trump did   is really what Donald Trump is like in private? That s what you re implying here with Hillary Clinton. The rape culture is strong in New York City s former Republican mayor.You can watch the segment below in full.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Lifelong Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger TERMINATES The GOP Over Trump," I ll be back  is not what Arnold Schwarzenegger is telling the Republican Party this year. Ever since the action movie icon became a United States citizen in 1983 he has faithfully voted for the GOP presidential candidate but not this year.Donald Trump s vulgar remarks about groping women were too much for the Terminator star, who, like other Republicans, are now jumping from a sinking ship.The Los Angeles Times reports that Arnold not only condemned Trump in a statement, but used the same statement to announce that he will not be voting Republican in November. For the first time since I became a citizen in 1983, I will not vote for the Republican candidate for president,  Schwarzenegger said in a statement posted on Twitter. Like many Americans, I ve been conflicted by this election   I still haven t made up my mind about how exactly I will vote next month. I have been a proud Republican since I moved to America in 1968 and I heard Nixon s words about getting government off our backs, free trade, and defending our liberty with a strong military. That day I joined the party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan.But as proud as I am to label myself a Republican, there is one label that hold above all else   American. So I want to take a moment today to remind my fellow Republicans that it is not only acceptable to choose your country over your party   it is your duty. As proud as I am to label myself a Republican, there is one label that I hold above all else   American. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/biRvY8S3aZ  Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) October 8, 2016As Governor of California, Schwarzenegger was embroiled in his own scandals which included an affair he had with his housekeeper that produced a child years prior to taking office, which he has taken responsibility for, and accusations of sexual misconduct for which he has expressed remorse.So Donald Trump s behavior and words are so bad that even Schwarzenegger can t bring himself to vote Republican. That s saying something.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" CNN Host John King: Trump Should Be Jail, Not Running For President (VIDEO)","As we all know, Trump told Access Hollywood host Billy Bush in 2005 that he made unwanted advances on a married woman and bragged that he walks up to beautiful women and just starts kissing them and  grab them by the p*ssy. Seriously. It s all on tape. Had the tape been turned over to police they might have opened a sexual assault investigation.On Sunday morning, CNN anchor John King said that Trump should be in jail instead of being the Republican nominee for president.King began by playing part of the clip of Trump talking about how he pursued a married woman by taking her furniture shopping. And then he talks about  moving on that b*tch. I said what you re about to see was some graphic language,  King said.  That s one of the tamest parts. And the point, if you go on in this tape, that s he s talking about making unwanted advances on a married woman. He also talks about conduct that is a crime. If he did it. People go to jail for the things that he was talking about doing, groping women. That was the dam opening. Indeed, it is a crime and that why many Republicans are desperately trying to distance themselves from Trump.The outrage was so bad that Trump was forced to apologize for the remarks, but King noted that it took Trump s aides hours to get him to actually do it. King proceeded to slam Trump for it and pointed out that what Trump said is not mere locker room talk. It s a confession to committing crimes. In his video released Saturday night, after it took his aides hours to convince him this was a big deal, that s important here too. He doesn t say in the video that I never did this. He never says he never did this. I m going to say it one more time: he s bragging about things that people go to jail for. I ve been to a lot of locker rooms. Men say stupid things in locker rooms. Men say inappropriate things in locker rooms. Men do not talk about committing crimes in locker rooms or, if anybody brings it up, the grown-up on the team pushes that guy against the locker and tells him to shut up. Here s the video via VidMe.In other words, Trump should have been investigated by law enforcement and should have been arrested, tried, sentenced to serve time in jail, and required to register as a sex offender. He certainly should never have been elevated to the leadership of a major political party and been allowed to get this close to becoming the most powerful person in the world. Republicans own this and they need to pay a price for it in November.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 That Time Donald Trump Said Bill Clinton Was The ‘Victim’ Of ‘Unattractive Women’,"Donald Trump is pledging to bring up Bill Clinton s sexual prowess at the second presidential debate. Now that Trump is in the hot seat over a hot mic leak that shows him gleefully admitting to sexual assault, he does what he knows best   deflect.In his half assed apology, Trump took responsibility for his comments, saying that a video from 10 years ago does not reflect the  man  he is now, but said Bill Clinton has done  much worse  and that Hillary Clinton was complacent in bullying and intimidating his victims.So that  the Trump strategy   deflect from his admissions of sexual assault by drumming up sins of Bill Clinton from the 1990s to smear Hillary (because women just love it when the wife is blamed for the husband s misgivings). There s only one teeny tiny problem with that, though.I don t necessarily agree with his victims. His victims are terrible. He is really a victim himself. But he put himself in that position.That s Donald Trump, in August 1998, calling Bill Clinton the real victim. In an interview with Fox News  Neil Cavuto, the billionaire mogul also trashed Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg as a  really unattractive group  and an  unattractive cast of characters. The transcripts are as followed:The whole thing, it s just so unattractive. Linda Tripp may be one of the most unattractive human beings I ve ever seen not women, human beings. She s just an unattractive person. This [Lucianne] Goldberg person, her agent or whatever she is, is just a terrible woman. You look at Paula Jones, I mean the whole cast of characters. It s like it s from Hell. It s a terrible group of peopleBut Trump wasn t finished insulting their personal appearances:The whole group, it s truly an unattractive cast of characters Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg I mean, this woman I watch her on television, just vomiting. She is so bad. The whole group Paula Jones, Lewinsky it s just a really unattractive group. And I m not just talking about physical, but I am also talking about physical.Trump then went on to say that had Lewinsky and Jones been  supermodels,  they would be  more pleasant to watch. Once again, Trump proves that he does not care about women unless they are visually appealing (which is completely subjective).But now, all of a sudden, he s their unsung hero against  abuser  Bill Clinton and his enabling wife, Hillary?Gee, what changed?If one thinks Trump truly cares about Jones, Lewinsky, Brodderick, Flowers or any of Clinton s alleged victims, they should keep in mind that Trump only cares about their appearances   and their appearances discount them   and he thinks Bill is the real victim.Do not be deceived America. This man will say anything and do anything to get elected.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 DNC Chair Speaks Out On Revolting Trump Tape: ‘This Is Who Donald Trump Truly Is’ (VIDEO),"Interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile was crystal clear in what she thinks of Donald Trump and the bombshell tape that showed him boasting about sexual assault:  This is who Donald Trump truly is. During an interview on ABC s This Week, Brazile told George Stephanopoulos that Trump is the same person today as he was in 2005 when the appalling tape was recorded. You can draw a straight line between what Donald Trump said in 2005 and what he s been saying every day on the campaign trail over the last year and a half,  she said on Sunday.  This is not a changed man. This is who Donald Trump truly is. The DNC chair listed a few of the previous offensive remarks Trump has made on the campaign trail and pointed to these as more examples that confirmed Trump has not changed. He was and is a revolting human being. When you criticize a judge simply because of his Mexican heritage. When you call women some of the most disgusting things. When you criticize John McCain. When you criticize people who are disabled. This is who Donald Trump truly is. Brazile doesn t seem surprised by this newest tape from the past. After all, this is someone who is accused of raping a 13-year-old child. With everything Trump has done, bragging about grabbing women  by the p*ssy  is exactly the kind of thing you would expect to come out of his mouth.  But what is surprising is that after everything Republicans have turned a blind eye to over the past few years, it is now that they are finally  disgusted by Trump. I m surprised that the Republicans are disgusted by Trump after all the things he has said and all of the comments that he s made over the last couple of years.

 Hannity Throws MASSIVE Tantrum Trying To Defend Trump’s Sexual Assault Remarks,"Fox News host Sean Hannity flew into a two-day rage desperately trying to defend Donald Trump.As revealed on Friday, Trump said some very vulgar and indefensible things about women in 2005 during an appearance on Access Hollywood. Trump bragged that he is so famous that he doesn t even wait to kiss beautiful women when he first sees them, even if they have no interest in kissing him. He also suggested that he commits sexual assault and gets away with it when he said he  grabs  women  by the p*ssy. The remarks dropped like a bomb on the Republican Party, and many Republicans have been running away from Trump ever since.But Sean Hannity spent Friday and Saturday trying to defend Trump by calling Trump s remarks mere  locker room talk,  excusing it because some biblical king who lived thousands of years ago had a harem of prostitutes, and attacked Hillary Clinton over Bill Clinton s extramarital activities.So Hillary s lack of outrage over her husbands ACTIONS are irrelevant in this discussion? Sorry, nice try. https://t.co/dw6RRS4zE8  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Im not defending his words. Why are you defending Bills ACTIONS and how Bill and Hillary smeared woman? https://t.co/IfK1tUwAiX  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Lol. So you only want to talk about @realDonaldTrump but not @HillaryClinton and her husband. YOU ARE THE SHILL! https://t.co/YWgQQ12lhG  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Ross, that was in response to a guest saying  these things  have gone on since the beginning of time, typical NYT BS https://t.co/t7lOLMMh2S  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Oral sex with an intern in the Oval Office Lies @HillaryClinton refers to Monica as a narcissistic loony toon! Fair? https://t.co/pANnv2qP1N  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Never. The only person I know in this campaign accused of that is @HillaryClinton husband Bill. https://t.co/COXXSWQRRM  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016@realDonaldTrump words are very inappropriate. Bills BEHAVIOR, and Bill and Hillary smearing of woman is now in play https://t.co/PdOj5esDzW  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Ok I understand how you feel. So how do you feel about @HillaryClinton and Bill s behavior and treatment of women? https://t.co/bO45R4a0mA  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 9, 2016Time will tell. Just 31 days. I ask again why does @HillaryClinton get a pass on far worse behavior? https://t.co/uvDetH4MOQ  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 9, 2016What s worse Americans abandoned in Benghazi or  locker room  talk. https://t.co/UVXsdZkL13  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 9, 2016Who wanted to  crucify  Gennifer Flowers? Who called Lewinsky a  narcissistic loony toon . Answer @HillaryClinton https://t.co/e8uA9f7Thn  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 9, 20164 Americans are dead after being abandoned by @HillaryClinton and  locker room talk  offends you more? https://t.co/KzvZWnCMdg  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 9, 2016As you can see, Hannity escalated his desperation as he went, eventually resorting to screaming about Benghazi even though Hillary Clinton was cleared of any wrongdoing by a Republican witch-hunt which lasted longer than the investigation of 9/11.And while Trump s comments are relevant because he is a candidate in this race, Bill Clinton s behavior as president is not fair play because he is NOT running for president. Hillary Clinton is.And Hannity s remark about King David keeping concubines is pretty damn pathetic as well since a concubine is defined as a sexual servant who is inferior to a man s wife. So Hannity just basically called women Trump has chased outside of his marriage inferior sex objects who are supposed to submit to his sexual demands. That pretty much makes this situation worse for Trump.While most normal people are condemning Trump and withdrawing their support from him, Hannity appears to be Trump s right-hand deplorable who will defend him no matter what he does, which makes one wonder where Trump grabbed Hannity to make him so submissive.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Giuliani’s PATHETIC Excuse For Trump’s Bragging About Sexual Assault Will Disgust You,"A tape featuring Donald Trump proudly boasting about sexually assaulting women has rocked the GOP this weekend. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is trying to brush it off as no big deal, arguing that men just  talk like that.  But CNN s Jake Tapper did not let him get away with this pathetic excuse.Appearing on State of the Union this Sunday morning, the former NYC mayor tried in vain to convince everybody that this was just locker talk and voters should still support Trump, even if he does brag about grabbing women  by the p*ssy. This is talk, and gosh almighty, he who hasn t sinned, throw the first stone,  Giuliani said of Trump s remarks on the leaked tape from 2005.Tapper cut him off and slammed Giuliani s bullshit argument.  Mr. Mayor, I have never said that. I have never done that,  Tapper said.  I am happy to throw a stone. I have been in locker rooms, I have been a member of a fraternity. I have never heard any man, ever, brag about being able to maul women because they get away with it. Giuliani wasn t dissuaded and continued to insist that this is just how men are. The fact is men, at times, talk like that. Not all men. Tapper asked the former mayor if he had ever said these kinds of things, but Giuliani just kept talking and pretended not to have heard the question. Giuliani then insisted:  I m not justifying it.  But he also never denied having made comments like this himself.Earlier in the interview, Giuliani said that Trump had apologized for his behavior and was likely to do so again during the upcoming debate on Sunday night. He apologized for them, he said that he was wrong, that doesn t reflect the way he looks at things today,  Giuliani said.  He made a full and complete apology for it, and I think he s going to do it again tonight.

 BREAKING: Trump Campaign In A Panic As Donors Demand Refunds,"Donald Trump s presidential campaign is spiraling out of control, and now that it looks completely doomed, Republican donors are beginning to ask for a refund. Stunned by the candidate s comments on assaulting women caught on an open mic as he chatted with Billy Bush, Republican donors are now at peak levels of outrage.A prominent Trump bundler told CBS News that he  could not tell you how many  calls he s gotten from donors in the course of the last day. After the Washington Post first published the tape, people want their money back, he said. (The Republican party and the campaign s fundraising apparatus is not returning donations.)According to the bundler, donors said they feel betrayed by Trump   that their efforts have been a waste. Some said they would like to see Mike Pence, Trump s running mate and the governor of Indiana, at the top of the ticket, though the means of achieving such a switch aren t clear.Trump has already vowed that he will not step down as the Republican Party s nominee, despite pulled support from over a dozen Senators and Representatives. The national party s hands are effectively tied anyway, as voting is already underway in some states where early voting has begun in person as well as with absentee ballots.While several of the senators who have called on Trump to step down have also asked for his running mate to step in, many believe that this is more of a face-saving maneuver than an actual serious demand. Many of those who have made this request are Republicans in seats that are under siege from Democratic candidates with a high likelihood of a win, in so-called  swing  states.For all intents and purposes, the money that donors have sunk into the Trump campaign is lost forever, funds spent on a campaign on the verge of a major loss.Featured image via YouTube",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Republican Insiders Are Taking Aim At Trump, Calling On Pence To Drop Out","Now that it s been exposed that Donald Trump is a serial pervert who sexually assaults women, Republicans are desperate to get him out of the race and promptly replaced by another GOPer who, you know, doesn t casually admit to forcing himself onto women.Well it s harder said than done. First, the rules make it very hard to remove someone and replace them   especially with four weeks left until the election. Second, Trump has already stated that he would not bow out of the race under any circumstances.Even though dozens of influential Republican lawmakers and figures want him out, they are stuck with him unless he decides to personally call it quits.So what s plan B? Well, for starters, they want Mike Pence to drop off the ticket in an effort to pressure Trump to follow suit.According to CNN s Dana Bash:Sources tell @GloriaBorger some republicans want @mike_pence to quit the ticket in order to pressure @realDonaldTrump to get out  Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) October 9, 2016In other words, Republicans are hoping to use Mike Pence as a battering ram to force their pathetic, perverted candidate out of the race and usher in an equally pathetic Hail Mary to save their asses.Republicans   especially those who placed all their hope in Trump   are officially the saddest lot in American politics.After cutting off his cash force, cancelling Mike Pence s campaign stops and publicly denouncing him in stinging rebukes, Republicans realized they couldn t shake him off. So they thought the only way they could do it was to hit him where it hurts   the man who is supposed to be by his side no matter what.Republicans, Donald Trump is your mess. Why should Pence suffer humiliation to save your mistake? Whereas Pence may be a deplorable homophobe and misogynist himself, he didn t put Trump in this position, Trump did.Whether or not Pence will buck Trump and save his 2020 plans remains to be seen. But for the time being, Trump-Pence look to be heading into a general election with Clinton-Kaine, and if the trends and polls seem to be indicator, it s looking great for the latter.Congratulations GOP, you built this. Now own it.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Apprentice’ Producer: Lewd #TrumpTapes Are Nothing – There Is ‘Far Worse’ To Come (TWEETS),"The GOP and the Donald Trump for president campaign are reeling after the world watched and listened in horror to Trump describing pursuits of married women and straight up sexual assault in some of the most vulgar terms imaginable with then- Access Hollywood producer Billy Bush. Even Trump s own wife and running mate couldn t defend what he s done, and his establishment support is being pulled in droves. However, despite the tailspin Trump s campaign   and indeed the entire Republican Party   is in, according to a former producer of The Apprentice, this is just the tip of the iceberg, and nowhere near the worst there is to see of Donald Trump.Bill Pruitt, who says he produced the show that made Trump a national figure of business prowess, tweeted the following on Saturday:As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice I assure you: when it comes to the #trumptapes there are far worse. #justthebegininng  Bill Pruitt (@billpruitt) October 8, 2016There seems to be credibility here as well, since Ed Henry of Fox News has suggested that Donald Trump s pal and former GOP primary rival Dr. Ben Carson has also said this is just the beginning. Henry tweeted:.@RealBenCarson told me he & @realDonaldTrump talked about more revelations coming: ""They have have more things & they will drip them out""  Ed Henry (@edhenry) October 8, 2016No one should be surprised by this. Trump is a sexual predator, and due to his money, power, and fame, he has gotten away with being one for his entire adult life. There s surely plenty of other hot mic tapes, Apprentice outtakes, and god knows what else out there that the world will be privy to in short order, and certainly prior to November 8th.For this reason, there will continue to be a drumbeat of calls from GOP heavy-hitters for Trump to drop out of the race, but Trump s ego will not allow him to do that. Further, he has said that he won t, via his favorite medium of communication and feuding: Twitter.The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly   I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2016Of course, his rabid, brainwashed supporters see nothing wrong with Trump s lewd, predatory tapes, and will continue to blame the media, the GOP establishment, Hillary Clinton, and everyone else but Trump himself for what is going on right now. Either way, the GOP is stuck with Trump through the election, and they will be left with nothing but ashes for their split and broken party afterward.Congratulations, GOP. You did this by propping this imbecile up and trying to put him in the White House, even though you know that it s the last place he should be. You re getting exactly what you deserve.

Alec Baldwin returned this week as Donald Trump (and Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton) to provide us with some much-needed levity following  Pussyghazi  or whatever one chooses to call the leak of Donald Trump explaining exactly where he likes to grope seemingly every woman he meets. Sure, some would call that sexual assault, but to Trump and gang it s just a friendly handshake that happens to involve someone s vagina.Trump s campaign has been scrambling to come back from this situation as his former allies practically climb all over one another to denounce, un-endorse, and repudiate The Donald, with many calling on him to drop out and hand the election to Hillary Clinton. It may seem surprising that talking about groping women was what did it given Trump s  wall  comments, his support for Muslim bans and even concentration camps, and the 9,764,487,921 other awful things he has done and said in just the past month. But that s where we re at, and Republicans are finally coming around.It s easy to get caught up in the furor, but Saturday Night Live once again swooped in at the end of the week and saved the day as a re-broadcast of the vice presidential debate is interrupted by coverage of Pussy-Gate. I deeply apple-gize,  Baldwin s Trump continues as they mock his first public apology ever, with Trump being unable to even say the word.The sketch features a cutaway to a party at the Clinton campaign after the news broke and lots, lots more pussy.

 New Audio Tapes Reveal Trump Called His Pregnant Wife A’Blimp’ And A ‘Monster’,"It turns out that there are more than just one audio recording out there where you can hear Donald Trump saying terribly misogynistic things. Around the same period a hot mic caught Donald Trump bragging about using his fame to sexually assault women in 2005, he also did an interview with Howard Stern where he said some very creepy and misogynistic things about his wife and daughter. This includes a bit of audio where Trump told Stern that it was okay for the shock DJ to call his daughter a piece of ass.  My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka,  says Trump during the interview.  By the way, your daughter,  says Stern. She s beautiful,  responds Trump. Can I say this? A piece of ass,  Stern responds. Yeah,  says Trump.During the show, Trump also called his wife Melania Trump a  monster  and a  blimp.   According to Trump he meant this to be a positive statement. That s because he was referring to Melania s breasts.  Like a blimp   in the right places. In her case, the right places. I mean she really has become a monster   in all the right places. I mean monster in the most positive way. She has gotten very, very large   in all the right places. Donald Trump s mouth is costing him big. It seems as if every hour another elected Republican has denounced Trump after Friday s release of the now infamous audio that has Trump s campaign burning in flames. Several have called for him to drop out of the race altogether. Even Mike Pence, his running mate had some sharp words for his electoral wingman. Funding halts suggest the RNC is prepared to stop supporting the Republican presidential nominee altogether. From now until the election   or Trump actually does end up dropping out   more skeletons from Trump s past are going to come out and consume his campaign. Remember just last week when it was revealed that Trump probably has not paid any income taxes in nearly two decades? The scandals just do not end with this loser. His campaign is toast. The fact that he has managed to stay as strong as he has in the race is a sad commentary on the state of the U.S. politics.   Trump, do yourself a favor and drop out already. It s only going to get worse from you from here on out.Featured image from Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"October 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Joe Biden Just Said What Every (Sane) Woman Is Thinking About Donald Trump,"Hillary Clinton and most of her surrogates have stayed silent, apparently waiting to pounce on Donald Trump during the debate scheduled for Sunday night. The Vice President, though, couldn t hold his opinion. He took to Twitter and said exactly what most women are thinking about Donald Trump s disgusting remarks about  grabbing  women by the  pussy.  Joe Biden called it sexual assault.The words are demeaning. Such behavior is an abuse of power. It s not lewd. It s sexual assault.  Joe  Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 8, 2016Much of the media (and Republicans) is treating the tape, in which Trump is heard talking about groping women and kissing them, without permission, as just more words. It s Trump as usual, they say, only raw and on steroids. The problem with that, though, is that Trump is describing criminal acts. He s clearly in the habit of using his power and money to take anything he wants, and women to Trump are just things.Biden has long been an advocate of women s rights. He has been a driving force behind helping to end the backlog of unprocessed rape kits.Biden was also key in the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in the Senate and calls it  the proudest thing I ve ever done.  His goal is to change the culture in this country. When a woman is raped, when a woman is abused, the first thing other women ask is what did you do? Why were you there? What were you wearing?  Biden said.  Folks, all the opportunity and entrepreneurship in the world is good. But ultimately, starting in this country, we have to change the culture. And we re not going to change that culture until not a single woman who is abused ever asks herself:  What did I do? Source: Huffington PostTrump supporters, of course, are doing the only thing they know how. They are playing a game of  I know you are but what am I  and are turning it around on Biden:Is this an official duty of the Vice President? Doubtful, Joe Biden , doubtful. Looks like an unwanted sexual advance. #TrumpTape pic.twitter.com/2JL40JDOlF  bbaroo (@DempseyToe) October 8, 2016They even posted this completely debunked video:You mean sexual assault like this, Joe Biden ? #TrumpTape pic.twitter.com/YhxKFTPiCT  bbaroo (@DempseyToe) October 8, 2016Of course, Biden isn t running for president and Trump is. It s not just women Trump disrespects, it s everyone. If his white male voters really think Trump is going to do something for them, they are sadly delusional. As for women, well, Trump s choice of Mike Pence as running mate should be all we need to know. The video was just confirmation that Trump isn t just a misogynist. He s a criminal, at east according to his own words.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Utah’s Oldest Paper DEMANDS Trump Drop Out Of Race In Scathing Must-Read Editorial,"As the Deseret News said on Saturday, they haven t endorsed a candidate in 80 years, but they made it clear who shouldn t be president in a damning editorial Trump supporters are going to hate. We are neutral on matters of partisan politics,  the editorial began.  We do, however, feel a duty to speak clearly on issues that affect the well-being and morals of the nation. Accordingly, today we call on Donald Trump to step down from his pursuit of the American presidency. Unlike some evangelical conservative  Christian  leaders like Tony Perkins and Ralph Reed, who still support Trump even after his lewd comments about groping women dropped like a bombshell on Friday, the Mormon-owned newspaper roundly condemned Trump and called for him to resign his candidacy, citing his lack of character.The idea that women secretly welcome the unbridled and aggressive sexual advances of powerful men has led to the mistreatment, sorrow and subjugation of countless women for far too much of human history.The notion that strength emanates from harsh, divisive and unbending rhetorical flourish mistakenly equates leadership with craven intimidation.The belief that the party and the platform matter more than the character of the candidate ignores the wisdom of the ages that,  when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.  (ProverbsThe editorial pointed to Trump s history of making misogynistic comments about women and said that Trump has failed time and time again to demonstrate the  ethical behavior  that presidents need to govern a nation with compassion, understanding, and respect. And then the editorial took aim at Trump s supporters.In the face of these revelations, it is disheartening to see otherwise decent individuals now attempting to defend Trump s talk, dismissing it as mere  locker room  bravado. At the time of the audio recording, Trump was not a hormonal teenage athlete, but rather a 60-year-old husband of an expectant mother and the father of four children.America s locker rooms deserve better.The Deseret News concluded by calling on Trump to resign but if he doesn t, Americans need to stand against him in November.This is one of those rare moments where it is necessary to take a clear stand against the hucksterism, misogyny, narcissism and latent despotism that infect the Trump campaign even as we hope for a more auspicious future of liberty, prosperity and peace for the nation.And it looks like the people will have to take that stand in November because Donald Trump has vowed to stay in the race. Let s just hope voters reject him by a landslide so that Republicans are never stupid enough to nominate someone like him ever again.Featured Image: Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",News,"October 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 JUST IN: Listen To Trump Tell Howard Stern It’s Fine To Call His Daughter A ‘Piece Of Ass’ (AUDIO),"It s been pretty obvious for a long time now that Donald Trump has a rather large crush on his daughter Ivanka. Even going so far as to say that if she wasn t his daughter he d be  dating her. It s gross to say the least, incestuous and disgusting to be perfectly honest.Well, now it s just been revealed that he thinks his daughter is a  piece of ass  and finds it perfectly acceptable for others to refer to her like that as well.In 2004, Trump appeared on the Howard Stern show yet again, and the subject of his daughter Ivanka came up. He said: My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka Stern responds: By the way, your daughter Trump interupts: She s beautiful. Stern asks: Can I say this? A piece of ass Trump replies: Yeah. Eewwwww.If Trump will talk about his own daughter like that, you know that he has absolutely zero respect for any and all women. No self-respecting woman should ever vote for him.Listen to the audio here:How any woman could vote for Trump at this point is beyond me. They either hate themselves or love being treated like a piece of meat. One or the other.Featured Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images",News,"October 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: RNC Pulls Funding For Trump — Is It All Over?,"A major indicator that Donald Trump s campaign might be over just occurred. The Republican National Committee has put a temporary halt on their program aimed at getting Trump into the White House. According to an email obtained by Politico, at least one top vendor in what is called the  Victory  program and one official at the RNC are named in the email s cc line.  Politico reports: In an email from the RNC to a victory program mail vendor, with the subject line  Hold on all projects,  the committee asked the vendor to  put a hold  on mail production.   Please put a hold/stop on all mail projects right now. If something is in production or print it needs to stop. Will update you when to proceed,  Lauren Toomey, a staffer in the RNC s political department, wrote in an email that was obtained by POLITICO. Officials with the RNC have yet to release a statement on the matter.This, of course, comes after an audio recording was released where Trump can be heard talking about violently groping women. Trump has a long record of using hateful misogynistic language towards women. After hearing Trump s remarks in the recording, several Republicans in Congress have called for Trump to drop out of the race. This includes a video that Senator Mike Lee posted to his Facebook page, where he said that  If anyone spoke to my wife or my daughter or my mother or any of my five sisters the way [Donald Trump] has spoken to women, I wouldn t hire that person. Even Mike Pence, Trump s running mate released a statement where he lambasted Trump for the comments. If your wingman in your campaign has to call you out for making violently misogynistic comments, then your campaign is probably doomed.The evidence is beginning to mount that Trump s reign of terror may finally be over. While Trump dropping out at this juncture would almost assure Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton s victory   it was beginning to look like she already had the election in the bag anyway. It isn t too hard to imagine the GOP accepting that they are damned with Trump or without him. They may have figured the best they can do at this point is to give up and try and conserve their resources rather than try to back a loser.Featured image from Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Melania Comes Out AGAINST Her Husband In New Statement (DETAILS),"After audio was leaked revealing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaking about women in a way that only a sexual predator would, even going so far as to say he ll just grab a woman by the  p*ssy  without her consent, many have come out condemning his remarks. Including many in the Republican party.Now, even Trump s wife Melania has released a statement condemning his horrible behavior.The statement reads: The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me. This does not represent the man that I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and world.

Many were waiting to see what she had to say, and this was more than many expected from her.It s going to be interesting to see how the Trump campaign handles all of this moving forward.Featured Photo by Michael Bocchieri/Getty Images",News,"October 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Campaign Chaos: Mike Pence Just Slammed Trump For His Remarks On Groping Women,"Only a few days ago, it seemed as if Donald Trump could not make a gaffe big enough to end his campaign. Then on Friday, audio of Trump from 2005 was released in which Trump makes violently misogynistic remarks regarding groping women. It s set his campaign into a tailspin and even his running mate, Mike Pence, is now calling out Trump.Pence made his remarks in a statement Saturday where he wrote:  As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the eleven-year-old video released yesterday. I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them. I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people. We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night. The beginning of Pence s statement is reminiscent of a viral video post made by Republican Senator Mike Lee made after hearing the audio. Except for the fact that Lee went a step further and pleaded with Trump to drop out of the race. Two other Republican Senators have called for Trump to drop out after hearing the audio. While the statement from Pence is written in a manner that positions Trump along the lines as a sinner who might still be capable of redemption, the word from insiders is that Pence is absolutely furious with Trump. WaPo national political correspondent, Philip Rucker, recently tweeted that a source close to Trump said that Pence is  absolutely apoplectic  about Trump s groping comments. A source close to Trump camp told me Pence and his team are  absolutely apoplectic,  ""melting down  and ""inconsolable.  Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) October 8, 2016This statement from Pence provides more evidence that Trump s campaign is in crisis. Pence s position as Trump s wing-man is clear. Pence is supposed to and has been making the case for Trump to socially conservative Christian Republicans, an unfortunate position to be in at the present moment. There is no way to make a man who caused the entire nation to hear the word  pussy  on repeat in the news cycle be palatable to the moderate Christian right-wing.

 Hypocrite Conservative ‘Christian’ Leaders STILL Support Trump After His ‘P*ssy’ Comments,"Just when you thought support of Donald Trump would drop to zero it turns out there is still one group that backs him 100 percent. Despite claiming to be all about  family values  and biblical principles, conservative evangelical leaders still refuse to revoke their endorsement of the Republican nominee.In 1995, Trump made vulgar comments about women while bragging to Access Hollywood reporter Billy Bush that he can grope any woman he wants because he is famous. You know I m automatically attracted to beautiful   I just start kissing them,  Trump said.  It s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don t even wait. And when you re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p*ssy. The offensive remarks were finally enough to cause many Republicans to condemn Trump and call for him to drop out of the race.But conservative  Christian  leaders like Family Research Council president Tony Perkins and Faith and Freedom Coalition president Ralph Reed say they both still support and want Trump to be President of the United States. My personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values, it is based upon shared concerns about issues such as: justices on the Supreme Court that ignore the constitution, America s continued vulnerability to Islamic terrorists and the systematic attack on religious liberty that we ve seen in the last 7 1/2 years,  Perkins said. Voters of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life, defend religious freedom, create jobs, and oppose the Iran nuclear deal,  added Reed.  Ten-year-old tapes of private conversation with a television talk show host rank very low on their hierarchy of concerns. Wow.These two so-called  men of God  are literally still supporting Donald Trump and think his remarks aren t a big deal at all. And they have the nerve to call themselves  Christians. It makes one wonder what it will take to make these assholes change their minds about Trump?Because sexually assaulting women certainly doesn t bother them at all. And frankly, they should be ousted from their positions and ostracized by the Christian community they claim to represent.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"October 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump-Supporting Conservative Writer Says The ‘Race Is Over’ Because Of ‘P*ssy’ Remarks,"Donald Trump s campaign just suffered its worst implosion yet, and conservatives have flown into a panic. On Friday, audio surfaced of Trump bragging to Access Hollywood reporter Billy Bush that he is so famous that he is able to  grab  any woman he finds beautiful  by the p*ssy. Ever since, Republicans have been running away from their own nominee, including Paul Ryan, Mike Lee, and Utah s GOP Governor. And even one of Trump s most ardent supporters is now declaring that his campaign is doomed.Crystal Wright wrote a column earlier this week in which she called black people  slaves  for voting for Hillary Clinton. She accused black people of voting for their color instead of voting their conscience.  What do blacks have to lose voting for Trump?  she asked.  Absolutely nothing. But now Wright is singing a different tune after the bombshell that dropped yesterday. I think it does matter what Donald Trump said and I think this is the death knell in his campaign,  she told CNN host Mike Smerconish after he pointed out that Trump supporters don t care what he says. A lot of Trump supporters are saying, is it doesn t matter what he does. It doesn t matter what he says. The thought of Hillary being president is so abhorrent  I am hitching myself to his wagon regardless.  Is that it? The problem with Donald Trump,  Wright explained.  The reason why this comment is a punctuation mark on the narrative that he hates women is because isolated incident after isolated incident, we find Donald Trump saying awful things about women. Indeed, Trump has a history of talking about women as if they are sex objects meant to be conquered and controlled by men, which is why over 70 percent of women have an unfavorable view of him in this election.Wright still refuses to vote for Hillary Clinton despite Trump s lewd comments but she did acknowledge that his campaign just lost the presidential contest. He cannot pivot away from this nonsense and talk about policies. Unfortunately this is coming in the ninth inning. I m not happy about it. I will not vote for her, but in many ways it looks to me like the race is over. Here s the video via CNN.You know Trump is in trouble when even his most ardent supporters can no longer defend him.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: GOP Senator Pleads With Trump To Drop Out Of The Election (VIDEO),"Mike Lee (R-Utah) has been a major figure in among Congressional Republicans in the #NeverTrump movement.  Following the release of audio recordings from 2005 that show just how much of a violent misogynist Donald Trump actually is, Lee has called for Trump to drop out of the race.  Lee posted a video to his Facebook page where he gives a scathing response to Trump. During the video the senator says: If anyone spoke to my wife or my daughter or my mother or any of my five sisters the way [Donald Trump] has spoken to women, I wouldn t hire that person. I wouldn t hire that person, wouldn t want to be associated with that person, and I certainly don t think I d feel comfortable hiring that person to be the leader of the free world. Lee is absolutely correct. Imagine if Trump sat down in a job interview and the person interviewing him heard what Trump said in 2005. No one in their right mind would hire a person like that. That isn t all Lee had to say. He goes on to lambast the Republican nominee calling for him to drop out and let someone else run in his place.  Your conduct, sir, is the distraction. It s the distraction from the very principles that will help us win in November. You yourself, sir, Mr. Trump, have stated repeatedly that the goal, the objective, has got to be to defeat Hillary Clinton in November. I couldn t agree more. Mr. Trump, I respectfully ask you, with all due respect to step aside. Step down. Allow someone else to carry the banner of these principles. Trump has no experience, no civility, and no practical policy ideas. If he was a prospective employee for any modern company, he would not be hired. It s ridiculous to think that a person whose public behavior would  keep them out of even entry level positions could possibly be deemed qualified to be the president of the United States. What every voter in the United States needs to ask themselves   especially women   is if they would enjoy having Trump as a boss. Would they feel comfortable working in an environment where they knew that their boss held openly violent misogynistic views? How about f the fathers and husbands out there knew that their wife or daughter was working for a man like Trump? I certainly wouldn t and I couldn t think of a single person who would want to live in such a nightmare scenario. Lee cannot say it, though he must know that having Trump drop out of the race at this point in the election would mean a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton. It could also possibly do major in down ballot elections across the nation, further jeopardizing the GOP s control of Congress. Lee and others appear willing to take that risk to prevent a Trump administration. That should tell every voter out there just exactly how important it is to keep Trump out of office.Watch:Featured image from video screenshot",News,"October 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Bill Maher BURIES Trump For His Crude ‘Grab Them By The P*ssy’ Remark,"Hurricane Matthew isn t the only hurricane, nor the biggest one, hitting the United States right now because Hurricane Trump struck again on Friday. Looks like we dodged the bullet a little bit with that storm,  Maher began in reference to the hurricane in Florida.  However, with Donald Trump talking about women, it has been upgraded to a category five shitstorm. Newly discovered audio caught the Republican nominee having an incredibly offensive conversation in the 1990s with Billy Bush on a hot mic about women during an appearance on Access Hollywood. Trump bragged about how he is so famous that he can walk up to any woman and just  grab them by the p*ssy  and that whenever he sees a beautiful woman he just starts kissing them, apparently even when they don t want him to do so.Maher said that not knowing that the mic was still on  is one indication that you re a fucking idiot  and proceeded to quote Trump s remarks while talking like him. You know I m automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. I don t even wait. When you re a star you can do anything. You can grab them by the pussy. Grab them by the pussy?!  Maher exasperatingly repeated before using the words to hit Trump where it hurts the most.  Sounds like what Hillary did to Trump at the first debate. Is this really happening?  Maher asked again. The guy who s running for president says  grab them by the p*ssy?!' Maher said he can t wait for the Sunday talk shows to hear how the Trump surrogates are going to spin this.  Look, George, people are tired of Washington politicians who won t grab the voters by the p*ssy. Donald Trump and Mike Pence are making sexual assault great again. Maher spent the remainder of his epic monologue slamming Mike Pence, informing the  family values  conservative who believe marriage is  the glue that holds societies together  that when Trump hugs Pence s wife,  that s not glue. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is a sexual predator who should be in prison, not the White House. This latest revelation is so bad that Paul Ryan disinvited Trump to his campaign rally in Wisconsin. The question is whether they will have the balls to remove Trump from the ticket entirely, because if they continue to stick with him as their nominee, every Republican on the ballot in November should be defeated.

 Robert De Niro Just Told The World He Wants To Punch Trump In The Face (VIDEO),"Robert De Niro was supposed to appear in a non-partisan public service announcement for the get out the vote organization, Vote Your Future, but the actor had a difficult time staying on script. Instead, he used the opportunity to go off on Trump in one of the most passionate anti-Trump videos to date. He s so blatantly stupid,  the video beings.  He s a punk. He s a dog (please don t insult dogs, Robert), he s a pig, he s a con, a bullshit artist, a mutt (again with the dog insult) who doesn t know what he s talking about. He doesn t do his homework,  De Niro continued,  doesn t care. He s gaming society, doesn t pay his taxes. He s an idiot. Colin Powell said it best,  he s a national disaster, he s an embarrassment to this country.' It makes me so angry,  added De Niro,  that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo, has wound up where he has. He talks how he wants to punch people in the face,  a visibly angry De Niro said,Vote Your Future chose not to include the video in their campaign, since they are non-partisan. Oddly, though, Fox News  Megyn Kelly did air the segment, in fact, it was giving specifically to her. Here it is:The video was recorded before Friday s game changing video of Donald Trump talking about groping women, but the timing coincided very well. You can be sure that De Niro s opinion hasn t changed.Is the fact that Kelly, on Fox News, was the person to release this video a sign that Fox News is turning on the GOP candidate or is this just another shot in Kelly s war against Trump?As for De Niro, bravo, although it s not a huge risk to turn on Trump these days. Everyone in Hollywood, from Republican politicians to evangelical Christians, are turning on Trump. The only remaining mystery is why people still support this narcissistic, thin-skinned, racist, nationalistic, misogynistic monster.Featured image via Kevin Winter/Getty Images.

 These 2 Trump Lovers Just Excused Him With The Most Appalling Statements Ever (TWEETS),"The fallout from what s turning out to be a thousand times worse than Mitt Romney s  47 percent  comment is spiraling out into the ether. Those who are still loyal to Trump are reaching ever further in a sad and sorry attempt to explain away his bragging about sexually harassing and assaulting Nancy O Dell back in 2005.First up is Sean Hannity, who s so far up Trump s ass it s hard to tell where he ends and Trump begins. He ll say anything as long as it keeps him Trump s good graces, even to the point where it causes problems with his colleagues at Fox News. But he really went too far in excusing Trump s behavior: King David had five hundred concubines for crying out loud.  Sean Hannity, who I can t believe I m watching but there it is.  Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) October 8, 2016Wow. King David had 500 concubines so it s okay for a man who s trying to appeal to Christians who abhor adultery supposedly to screw around. Except it wasn t  screwing around.  That implies it was mutual. Clearly, Hannity is laboring under the delusion that all the outcry is because Trump cheated on Melania. Trying to rape a woman is not just  cheating.  Hannity s response is actually worse than Ben Carson s response, where his spokesperson ended his statement by saying  the flesh is weak. The chair of the Washington State Republican Party is little better, blaming Democrats for this:Washington State Republican Party Chair Susan Hutchison defends Trump comments, says they  were made when he was a Democrat  BNO News (@BNONews) October 8, 2016So it s all okay because he wasn t a Republican then. This would never happen now (except Trump hasn t changed and won t change so it most definitely can happen now). Maybe she s worried that this will reflect badly on the GOP? It does   they chose this misogynistic stale beer fart for their standard-bearer. Saying it happened when he was a Democrat, as if that makes it all okay, just looks even worse.Give it up, guys.

" One Of Trump’s Groping Victims Just Came Forward, Campaign Is PANICKING (VIDEO)","After a tape was released in which Donald Trump was heard talking about how he loves to grope women, even married women, you can expect a rash of his victims to come forward. The first one, it appears, was with his one-time business partner, Jill Harth.The New York Times wrote about Harth s experiences on Friday. In it, she called Trump  relentless.  The man she described in the interview was a predator   a would-be rapist.She and her longtime boyfriend, George Houraney attended meetings with Trump in the early 90s. Even when sitting at a table with her boyfriend, Harth recalled Trump putting his hand up her skirt, all the way up to her crotch. I didn t know how to handle it. I would go away from him and say I have to go to the restroom. It was the escape route. Darth and Houraney had approached Trump with a business proposal that was right up his alley. They wanted to hold  calendar girl  beauty contests, an automobile show, a music competition and other events at his Atlantic City casino. They wanted Trump to do business with them, but as the evening wore on, Harth was getting more and more uncomfortable.The first sign of trouble came the day before the evening groping, in an initial business meeting in which, Harth and Houraney say, Trump spent the time asking about the breasts of the beauty contestants   real or enhanced?   and staring at Harth, then 30. At one point he asked Houraney,  Are you sleeping with her?  Houraney explained awkwardly that they were a couple, but Trump was unfazed. You know, there s going to be a problem,  Trump told Houraney, according to a 1997 sexual harassment lawsuit Harth filed against him.  I m very attracted to your girlfriend. About six weeks later, Trump gave Harth and Houraney a tour of Mar-a-Lago. They brought some of the calendar girls, but Trump wanted Harth. He pulled her into Ivanka s room (that s right, he tried to have sex in his daughter s bedroom.) I was admiring the decoration, and next thing I know he s pushing me against a wall and has his hands all over me,  Harth told me.  He was trying to kiss me. I was freaking out. Harth says she was desperately protesting, and finally managed to run out of the room and find the group again. She and Houraney left rather than stay the night, as they had intended.Harth and Houraney tried to continue the business relationship. Trump kept persisting and Harth was afraid he was going to rape her. His mind was in a totally different place than mine,  Harth recalls.  He thinks he s God s gift to women. They did end up doing business with Trump. She didn t report it to the police. Trump, not surprisingly, tried not to pay the couple, but he eventually settled out of court, but only after she agreed to withdraw a sexual harassment suit, which detailed all the allegations.The couple eventually married and then divorced. They do not speak, but their stories, according to the Times, did match. Eventually, Harth ended up dating Trump. When asked why, Harth responded: I was scared, thinking,  what am I going to do now?  she says.  When he called me and tried to work on me again, I was thinking maybe I should give this a try, maybe if he s still working on me, I should give this rich guy a chance. Here she is talking about it with The Guardian:Trump didn t respond to the New York Times, but he has publicly trashed Harth in the past, saying she was the one who was obsessed. She, surprisingly, wanted to work on his campaign, doing his hair and makeup. Still, the Times is convinced her story is true and after Friday s revelations, it wouldn t be surprising. We know Trump has zero respect for women. We know he sees them as a collection of body parts and that s it. We also know that he feels entitled to take whatever the hell he wants, even if what he wants is a human being. Trump is even accused of raping a 13-year-old. Would attempting to rape an adult be so inconceivable? It is going to be tough for Trump to spin his way out of this.Featured image Jill Harth via video screen capture | Featured image of Donald Trump via Diane Freed/Getty Images.",News,"October 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Trump Issues Bizarre Response To Leak Of Groping Audio, And It’s A Total DISASTER (VIDEO)","Donald Trump issued a strange video after midnight on Friday night to address the leaked audio of him making crude jokes about sexually assaulting women. The video, released via his Facebook page had all the appearance of a hostage video, and the actual content was almost as bad.Referencing his comment that he would  grab them by the p y  and that he was in favor of pushing himself on women and kissing them, Trump said,  Anyone who knows me knows these words don t reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize. He then went on to say,  Hillary Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground,  and made the allegation that  Bill Clinton has actually abused women. The comments come as condemnations continue to pile up against Trump from his fellow Republicans, and some have also called for him to completely drop out of the race. Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, stuck in a tight race against Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, called for Trump to leave the race, as did former New York Governor George Pataki.Other Republicans, while not calling for Trump to drop out, issued condemnations, including Speaker Paul Ryan (who disinvited him from a joint campaign event), Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Marco Rubio, former Governor Jeb Bush, and Senator Kelly Ayotte, among others.Trump was roundly condemned by Hillary Clinton s campaign, and her spokesperson issued a statement:  This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.  Her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine also responded to Trump s remarks:  This kind of behavior is disgusting. It makes me sick to my stomach. Some reports have indicated that senior officials hastily arranged meetings on Friday night to discuss possible scenarios in which Trump would be removed from the ticket. But doing so is nearly impossible at this point, and several states that allow early voting have already had ballots cast.This is unquestionably a disaster for the Republican Party, and Trump s crazed, petulant video does not help.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Tried To FIRE The Woman He Worked So Hard To Sleep With After She Spurned Him,"The woman that Trump claimed he tried so hard to sleep, and admittedly failed to do so, is Nancy O Dell, who hosted the Miss USA pageant in 2004 and 2005. Trump spoke of sexually assaulting her in 2005, but what many may not know is that he apparently tried to have her fired after that.At the time, he said he didn t like the way she looked while she was pregnant. TMZ reported, back in 2007, that Trump couldn t do that. O Dell s contract was with NBC, not with Trump, and he got overruled. O Dell kept her job, and Trump got to sulk in the background.So the  official  reason for wanting to fire her was that he didn t like the way she looked pregnant. Knowing Trump, though, he was butthurt that she d spurned him and wanted to punish her for the audacity. This is the man that pretended to be a PR person to hype up his own prowess with women back in the early  90s, after all.Trump claims he was just joking with Billy Bush on an  Access Hollywood  bus when the ahem disgustingly unfortunate comments about assaulting O Dell were made. O Dell was slated to host Miss USA with Bush that year, making this all the more terrible.Billy Bush is now a co-host of NBC s  Today Show,  and is probably in some hot water, considering this is the third time he s given NBC problems. He issued an apology for his role in pushing sexual harassment and assault as something men can just do when they re famous, saying: I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I m very sorry. Yeah, younger and less mature totally excuses this. It also totally excuses trying to fire her afterward. Trump s true motives may never be known, but it s highly suspicious, and knowing Trump, it s because her rejection just rankled him and he had to put her in her place.Photo of Donald Trump by Ralph Freso/Getty Images.

 Trump’s Revolting ‘Hot Mic’ Moment Has Just Blown His Campaign And The GOP To Bits (VIDEO),"Earlier today, an audio recording surfaced of Donald Trump talking about working really hard to fuck a married woman eight months after he married Melania. But this is about more than just a leaked extramarital affair; he actually tried to assault this woman and he bragged that he just starts kissing beautiful women, which is likewise sexual assault.His inner circle and surrogates don t know what to do with this.Mike Pence actually dodged his press pool and then disappeared when they asked him about it. Politico s Matthew Nussbaum got that on video and posted it to Twitter earlier today:My attempt to get Pence to respond to the Trump tape. He ignored the question. pic.twitter.com/jgv5rUJZIb  Matthew Nussbaum (@MatthewNussbaum) October 7, 2016Perhaps, when he s had a chance to calm down, he ll tell the press that Trump never said those things he said. He s good at that. Maybe he ll even say the audio was doctored, the Washington Post s David Farenthold obviously fabricated it, whatever. It ll be the only way that Mr. Mike Family Values Pence can deal with this without cracking up.One of Pence s campaign staffers said that his hasty departure with no comment to his press pool had nothing to do with this news. We call bullshit on that.Ben Carson, another staunch defender of  family values,  and who s one of Trump s surrogates now for whatever reason, said through his spokesman that this is no big deal, because everyone cheats on their spouse: You know, these things happen. I m sure somebody could find a video of Bill Clinton talking like this   are we gonna say Bill Clinton was the same person as president that he is today? Obviously not.People commit adultery. It happens. Ministers. Heads of state. Everyday people. People are human, they do human things. It s nothing unusual that somebody committed adultery on their spouse. Women do it. Men do it. Should we be shocked by it? No. The difference is that Republicans tried to argue, back in the day, that Bill Clinton s sexual escapades made him unfit to be President. They felt, at the time, that presidents should be held to a higher standard. Yet here s Ben Carson, a staunch evangelical and Republican, basically saying,  Eh. Everyone does it. So what? Others are not so quick to defend him, though. Paul Ryan, who had finally managed to swallow his bile enough to appear with Trump, disinvited him to the Wisconsin event tomorrow and will appear alone.He said: I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who has spent an awful lot of time defending Trump from various attacks since the July convention, blasted him: No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever. And one of his own campaign advisers said: This should have never happened. I wish it had never happened. I think I know that men talk this way sometimes, but it s nothing I would ever want to hear or condone or approve of. My reaction is   it s appalling. It s just flat out appalling. The adviser said,  Another day in Trump world I hate it. Trump s campaign did issue an apology, but it was lukewarm and backhanded and tried to deflect some of the backlash by saying Bill Clinton was probably worse.And so it goes. If Bill Clinton was unfit to serve because of his extramarital affairs, then what s Trump for sexually assaulting women and openly bragging about it? The GOP will never coalesce around a response for this.Featured image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NEW EVIDENCE Confirms Worst Fears: Russia Is Behind Hacks Aimed At Making Trump President,"The White House announced on Friday that it was  confident the Russian government, hiding behind the anonymous  Guccifer 2.0  moniker, has been unilaterally responsible for a series of breaches and leaks against the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic political entities for one reason   to tilt the election in favor of Donald Trump. The Obama Administration is asking  state and local election officials to be vigilant and seek cybersecurity assistance,  which most states have agreed to do.Without mentioning Trump by name, Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, said in a statement: These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow   the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there.We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. It appears the truth is out   Trump s newfound BFF and idol, Russian President Vladimir Putin, is in the hot seat, and his cronies will have to answer for their rigging of our election system.This confirmation comes several weeks after Democrats on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees have come to the same conclusion; that Russia is, indeed, behind the recent hackings. Rep. Adam Schiff, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, applauded the White House s response, and called on it to release their findings to the pubic: I applaud the administration s decision to publicly name Russia as the source of hacks into U.S. political institutions. All of us should be gravely concerned when a foreign power like Russia seeks to undermine our democratic institutions, and we must do everything in our power to guard against it. Congress knows it. The White House knows it. The media knows it. The voters know it. Russia is trying to influence this election and get their friend and ally Donald J. Trump elected.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Trump Camp May Have Just Thrown Out Every Crucial Swing State,"Trump s campaign is continuing its ahem unorthodox methods following revelations that internal polling shows Trump s numbers are even worse than they re letting on. Less than five weeks before the election, the campaign has actually cancelled $1.6 million in ad buys in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida and North Carolina, as well as New Hampshire, Maine, Iowa and Colorado.Trump only has a couple of paths to the White House, and they all involve most of these states. He doesn t win these states, he doesn t win the election. End of, so why on earth would they do this when we re nearing the home stretch? A senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, tried to spin it as a strategic move, saying: Our data-driven campaign is shifting resources from over-performing markets to new battlegrounds w/in the battlegrounds. Buy is growing. Outsiders are skeptical, though. Dan Pfeiffer, who once served as Obama s communications director, said: This is what the professionals call horseshit. Pfeiffer could have said,  Total, utter and complete horseshit,  but he was probably being diplomatic. The Trump campaign claimed they were going to spend $100 million on ad buys from the beginning of September through the Nov. 8 election. They ve spent less than half of that, though, and part of the problem is questions about how the campaign plans to pay for all those ads.In fact, it s bad enough that outside groups are starting to pick up the slack. It s not likely going to be enough, however, and Republicans are actually expecting Trump to write himself another check in order to keep his campaign afloat.While it s true that they aren t pulling all the ads from those states and are supposedly keeping them in bigger markets, this smacks of the disarray in the campaign following Trump s series of worse-than-usual weeks. Furthermore, there is another debate coming up, and with Trump s horrible performance in the last one, the campaign may be rearranging everything it can in anticipation of a repeat performance, to try and mitigate the damage.Regardless, this could easily backfire on them.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Still Racist As Ever, Continues To Accuse Exonerated ‘Central Park Five’ Of Rape (TWEETS)","Republican nominee Donald Trump s outreach to win over minorities has been a disaster, and what he just said about a group of exonerated men is probably going to end whatever support he had.Trump had been big on accusing the  Central Park Five    the five teens wrongfully accused of raping a woman in Central Park   ever since the case blew up in 1989. During that time, Trump had taken out a full-page ad in the New York Times blaming the teens, and using them as the reason why New York State should bring back the death penalty (ironic, because Trump himself has been accused of rape several times). The ad, which was signed by Trump himself, said: They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. Just to be clear, these were minority TEENAGERS  one was Latino and four were black   and Trump called for their death. Decades later, Trump continues to double down on those comments. According to a CNN report, Trump revealed that he still thinks these five men are guilty, despite the fact that they were exonerated and awarded $41 million for wrongful imprisonment in 2002. Trump said: They admitted they were guilty. The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same. Yes, Trump still believes these men are responsible for what happened to Trisha Meili, despite the fact that DNA evidence pointed to Matias Reyes, who confessed to the crime.Trump has questioned the release of the Central Park Five before. After the men were released and received their settlement in 2014, Trump said,  Settling doesn t mean innocence. Fortunately, no one has forgotten Trump s racist past with the Central Park Five, and are spreading this information far and wide just weeks ahead of the election. This is certainly a bad time for Trump to be reminding everyone how racist he is:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterIt s mind-boggling that Trump still cannot accept their innocence, despite the evidence. But perhaps this explanation by Michael D Antonio, the author of The Truth About Trump, will shed some light onto it: He s not a person who takes in new information and then adjusts and accepts reality. The only reality that matters to him is his judgment, which was rendered many years prior.

 BREAKING: Trump’s Worst Nightmare Realized As Hot Mic Destroys His White House Chances (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a misogynist. We all know that. He has demonstrated it many times, and anyone with access to cable or the internet has seen the numerous advertisements from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s campaign using Trump s own words as we see images of young girls and women with body image issues. That s to say nothing of the week-long weight-shaming episode he engaged in with the winner of Miss Universe 1996, Alicia Machado, who revealed that Trump publicly humiliated her during her reign for putting on a few pounds, and even referred to her as  Miss Piggy. As horrific as all of those examples are, though, that s nothing compared to what has just been released. It is a 2005 conversation between Trump and Billy Bush, who worked for Access Hollywood at the time. Trump and Bush were on a bus, and they were discussing women s bodies. Trump had only been married to Melania for eight months at the time, but he was going on and on about some married woman he had been attempting to sleep with. On the audio, Trump s clearly recognizable voice can be heard saying: I moved on her actually, she was down in Palm Beach and I failed. I ll admit it. I did try to fuck her, she was married   and I moved on her very heavily. I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture and I told her  I ll show you where you can get some nice furniture,  Trump is heard saying.  I moved on her like a bitch, and I could not get there, and she was married. And all the sudden I see her and she s got the big phony tits, she s totally changed her look.' He says of women he finds attractive in general: I m automatically attracted to beautiful women   I just start kissing them, it s like a magnet. I don t even wait. And when you re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything  Grab  em by the pussy. Trump then goes on to talk about a pretty woman who was to greet them at the bus: Woah, woah. I gotta use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. Of course, the Trump campaign is brushing it aside. Trump himself says in a statement: This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course   not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended. No, this is most certainly NOT just  locker room banter  at this point. This is just another chapter in a lifetime of misogyny, of objectifying, bullying, and mistreating women. If this doesn t show that Donald Trump is a clear sexist who engages in regular bouts of disgusting lewdness and belongs nowhere near the White House, I don t know what will.Listen to his disgusting words below (warning: explicit language):Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 White Supremacist PAC Launches Radio Ad Touting Trump As Champion Of Christians,"Remember the pro-Trump white supremacist PAC that was placing robocalls on The Donald s behalf during the primaries? Yeah, well, they re back. And this time, they have unleashed a xenophobic radio ad touting Donald Trump as the champion of Christians.William Daniel Johnson, a Los Angeles attorney, was happy to foot the bill for the new ad via the super-PAC American National. The white nationalist PAC is not actually affiliated with the Trump campaign, but man, they just love the GOP nominee and his bigoted messages. Our country is at a crossroads and time is running out,  the ad begins. It then throws in some good old-fashioned anti-brown people fearmongering and asks,  Do you want a strong leader who will secure our borders and stop the flow of illegal aliens and radical Islamic terrorists?  And follows up with a reminder that a vote for Trump is clearly a vote for Jesus, asking, Do you want a president who will safeguard the interests of Christians? So just who is William Johnson? Well, for starters, he a well-known white supremacist who says he wants to create  a white ethno-state because  that s the only way western civilization and the white race will survive. Johnson is also serving as the president of the American Freedom Party (AFP). According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the AFP was  initially established by racist Southern California skinheads,  and aims to deport immigrants and return the United States to white rule. There was an uproar when it was discovered that the Trump campaign had chosen Johnson to serve as a delegate. Following the backlash, the campaign claimed it was all a mistake due to a database error   and Johnson stepped down. The AFP said it was no big deal because plenty of other of white supremacists were serving as Trump delegates.The robocalls Johnson sponsored during the primaries featured such phrases as,  We don t need Muslims. We need smart, well-educated white people.  In another call, an older woman identified herself as a proud member of the AFP and said, I am voting for Donald Trump because he will not only be presidential, he will put America first. Furthermore, he will respect all women and will help preserve Western civilization. Trump was pressured into giving one of his half-ass condemnations of the robocalls, but he followed it up by excusing the calls as simply the result of people being angry. So no harm, no foul.Johnson also set up a 24/7 hotline offering legal advice and emotional support to Trump fans who felt they had been bullied by one of Hillary s evil liberal minions.The radio ad is scheduled to air in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nevada, Oregon, and Tennessee.Featured image via  Christopher Gregory/Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox Hosts Crudely Brag That Hurricane Matthew Will Hurt Democrats In Florida,"Hurricane Matthew is helping Republicans suppress voters who could help Democrats win Florida in November and Fox News is gleeful about it.During a broadcast on Fox Business, host Stuart Varney and guest Tucker Carlson bragged about how Florida Governor Rick Scott refuses to extend the voter registration deadline past October 11th even though a massive hurricane is forcing mass evacuations from the coastal areas. I expect President Obama to go down there, probably Hillary Clinton will go down, and probably Donald Trump,  Varney began. So there s going to be the aftermath politics. Who s going to win this one? Carlson responded by basically calling Democratic voters lazy and seemed to relish the idea that weather hurts Democratic voters. The conventional view, and I think it s right, is that anything that makes voting more difficult hurts the Democrats because their voters tend to be less committed   and there may be other factors there too. But that is definitely what political consultants believe. If it rains, there s bad weather, if anything gets in the way of easy voting, Democrats suffer. Varney mentioned that Governor Scott, a Trump supporter, has refused Clinton s request to extend the deadline. I guess that would tend to favor the Republican Party in November,  he quipped. It favors people who are organized, who know what they re voting for, who have their lives together,  Carlson responded.  I mean, I guess you could say that favors the Republicans. Varney himself admitted that gloating about the good fortune of Republicans when a hurricane is pounding the state and causing a lot of damage to people s homes is  almost crass,  but that didn t deter either host one bit. What I m getting at here is you ve got this massive storm, it s arrived, it has hit Florida, Florida is a key state The politicians are going to be all over it. My initial reaction is to say that it favors the Republicans. I hate to be   I think that sounds almost crass to be making political judgments when the storm is still hitting But nonetheless, I think that s where its going. Here s the video via Media Matters.Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are locked in a battle for the presidency and Florida is a state that has had historical importance on Election Day, especially when the election is close.And since Democrats lead the GOP in registered voters and have added tens of thousands of new voters to the rolls, especially Hispanics, it s clear that Republicans are using Hurricane Matthew as an excuse to stifle Democratic gains.Florida Governor Rick Scott should extend the deadline but he is only interested in doing things that helps Republicans, even if that means screwing over thousands of Florida residents.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox Host Gives Trump The Most PATHETICALLY Desperate Advice For Winning Second Debate (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s first debate against his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton went just as poorly as we thought it would   and conservatives know it. It s never been more clear that Trump doesn t even deserve to be on the same stage as Clinton, and all the holes in his campaign are being exposed effortlessly. Between the fact-checking and not having any real policies or plans in place, Trump is f*cked big time. Luckily, Fox News is coming to the rescue with some (truly awful, somewhat hilarious) advice for the inexperienced man-baby.Fox News host Charles Krauthammer thinks that Trump s greatest chances of succeeding during Sunday s second presidential debate will rely on Trump s amazing ability to lie about everything. Basically, Krauthammer thinks Trump can win if he can  deny it ever happened  and  ignore the fact-checkers.  The Fox host pointed out where Trump had gone wrong during the first debate: I think the most important thing here for Trump is the morning after. He might have lost the debate. It was pretty close. It was not the rout that people say it was. But he really threw it away the morning after when he went after   he went down the rabbit holes on the Miss Universe and all the other stuff. And that s happened to him before. Krauthammer then tried to give Trump some pointers on how to beat a far more experienced, qualified Clinton: I think he can hold his own. He just needs to be   to ignore, as everybody here has said   ignore the bait. He should just dismiss all the quotations that he hears, the way that Pence did. Deny it ever happened and then ignore the fact checkers the next day. It is hilarious that anyone would suggest that Trump can  ignore the bait.  Trump is a loose cannon with the temperament worse than a toddler. Literally every time he gets baited (even by Clinton herself), he cannot resist taking it and making a bigger ass out of himself. Krauthammer is basically begging Trump to keep his ego in check, even though he s proven that he s incapable of doing that. Conservatives need to start accepting that Trump is going to blow this debate just like the first one, no matter how hard they try to guide him.You can watch Krauthammer try to help Trump below:[ad3media campaign= 1075 ]Featured image via Ethan Miller / Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: The Daily Show Epically DESTROYS Fox News For Blatant Racism,"The Daily Show needs to go after Fox News more often because Jon Stewart would definitely be proud of this.Earlier this week, Bill O Reilly sent his goon, Jesse Watters to Chinatown in New York City to make fun of Asians using every stereotype in the book. Watters asked the residents, some of whom couldn t speak English, everything from if they know karate to if they can take care of North Korea for us.Asian American organizations were not amused and swiftly condemned Fox for the segment and demanded an apology.But nobody ripped Fox News a new one better than Daily Show correspondent Ronny Chieng. First of all, let me get this straight   they say China in the debate so you go to Chinatown? In New York?  Chieng frustratingly asked.  So, when they mention Mexico, do you send someone to Taco Bell? Chinatown is nothing like China! They have nothing to do with each other. It s like if I want to talk about women s rights, I decide to go to Fox News to get opinions. But it was nothing compared to the idiocy that followed,  Chieng continued.After showing some of the footage Fox put together, which included Watters asking if he should bow and if it s the year of the dragon, Chieng went off on him. No, it s actually the year of go f*ck yourself!  Chien yelled before taking Watters to the woodshed for all the racist stereotypes he used for the segment. If you re going to with racist, at least get your stereotypes right, you ignorant sack of sh*t! Karate isn t Chinese it s Japanese and you re doing it in a tae kwon do studio which is Korean, you f*cking jackoff! Jackoff! Jackoff! F*ck this guy! And, seriously, Mr. Miyagi? Update your reference material. That s like me making fun of Americans for  Saturday Night Fever  and Mr. T. But that s wasn t the end. Watters also got his ass handed to him for trying to talk to residents who didn t understand English. A*shole, they don t speak English, that s why they re silent,  Chieng said.  It s easy to make fun of someone when they can t respond. I ll show you. Chieng threw an image of Watters on the screen and began asking him questions and each question was epic. Hey, douchebag, why do you look like a guy who carries around a pack of roofies just in case? Why do you look like you have a hooker on speed dial? And is it hard to fit Bill O Reilly s entire scrotum in your mouth? And in the final take-down of Watters and O Reilly, Chieng spoke with Chinese Americans himself about the segment, asking one about Jesse Watters. This is how he replied. The chickensh*t reporter who came here and thought he was funny because he talked to people who couldn t speak English? The one who was sent here by the larger chickensh*t who wouldn t come into Chinatown because he was afraid to do it himself? The one with no testicles, who came down here, who said  let me talk to some old people and let me put them on camera without asking them and sort of put them on national television and made fun of them in the worst possible way? As I said before, EPIC.Here s the video via The Daily Show.The Daily Show has largely chose not to go after Fox News very much since Jon Stewart left, and that has been an absolute shame. So you know Fox News did something incredibly outrageous when the Daily Show really has no choice but to cover it and mock it relentlessly. Let s just hope they focus on slamming Fox more often.Featured Image via screencap.",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Yet ANOTHER Trump Advisor Caught With Disturbing Russian Connections,"There is a disturbing trend in the Trump campaign. After revelations in August came to light that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was a lobbyist on behalf of pro-Russian Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych, he resigned in shame, and currently undergoing investigation.Then, one month later, another Trump advisor, Carter Page, was probed for potentially holding secretive talks with Russian officials in an effort to have U.S. sanctions lifted. Ever since then, the Trump campaign has severed any ties with Page they once had.If the evidence couldn t be clearer that Trump is surrounding himself with pro-Russian allies in order to accomplish some nefarious endgame, it s been reported that yet another advisor has been caught doing business with Russia while coordinating with the campaign.According to congressional lobbying disclosures, Richard Burt received $365,000 from a Russian government-owned firm lobbying for a proposed natural-gas pipeline. The pipeline, which is opposed by the United States, would allow Russia to bypass Ukraine and Belarus thus greatly expanding Putin s power in Europe and abroad.Burt was responsible for crafting Trump s first major foreign policy speech in which Trump called for greater cooperation with Russia:I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia   from a position of strength   is possible. Common sense says this cycle of hostility must end. Some say the Russians won t be reasonable. I intend to find out.Burt also held policy meetings on national security and foreign policy with Alabama Senator (and Trump cheerleader) Jeff Sessions. Sessions is also the chair of the Trump campaign s national security committee.Not surprisingly, the Trump campaign did everything it could to play dumb, denying that the campaign knew nothing about any of this:We have no knowledge of this. In fact, our team cannot verify his self-proclaimed contributions to Mr. Trump s speech and, I don t believe Mr. Trump or our policy staff has ever met Mr. Burt. To our knowledge he had no input in the speech and has had no contact with our policy team.Either the Trump campaign managers are blatantly lying to everyone s faces, or they have no idea what s going on in their own campaign. Either way, the notions of doubt, deflection and ignorance isn t a good look.According to Politico:The revelation of Burt s simultaneous lobbying and campaign-advising comes at a time of mounting concerns about Russian attempts to manipulate the presidential election. Private security experts and American intelligence officials have concluded that recent hacks of the Democratic National Committee, state elections systems, and political figures were likely carried out by Russian government hackers. Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly professed admiration for Putin and called into question whether he would honor the United States  mutual defense obligations to NATO allies should they face Russian invasion.Third times the charm, apparently. So after three advisers have been tied to Russia, only time will tell just how much influence the rogue nation really does have on this election.The Trump campaign better start giving answers, before Hillary Clinton starts asking questions.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 David Letterman Calls For ‘Damaged’ Donald Trump To Get A Psychological Exam,"David Letterman may be retired but his opinion about Donald Trump still carries a lot of weight, especially when you consider that he has interviewed him many times over the years.In an interview with the New York Times, the legendary comedian who formerly hosted The Late Show talked about the Republican nominee and how the two used to interact on the program whenever Trump was a guest. Nobody took him seriously, and people loved him when he would come on the show,  Letterman said.  I would make fun of his hair, I would call him a slumlord, I would make fun of his ties   and he could just take a punch like nothing. He was the perfect guest. That s a complete flip from the Trump the public has seen over the last year and a half. Trump is known for having a thin skin and he often lashes out over the smallest slights against him. Just a simple criticism is enough to send him over the edge, whether it s on Twitter or during his rallies.It was during one such rally when Trump attacked a reporter critical of his campaign by mocking his disability on stage in one of the most disgraceful moments of the 2016 Election season.And it s a moment Letterman says should have disqualified Trump and made him a pariah in our society. I can remember him doing an impression, behind a podium, of a reporter for the New York Times who has a congenital disorder, and then I thought, if this was somebody else   if this was a member of your family or a next-door neighbor, a guy at work   you would immediately distance yourself from that person. And that s what I thought would happen. Because if you can do that in a national forum, that says to me that you are a damaged human being. If you can do that, and not apologize, you re a person to be shunned. Letterman then suggested that Trump is behaving so badly that he should get his head examined. I don t know anything about politics. I don t know anything about trade agreements. I don t know anything about China devaluing the yuan. But if you see somebody who s not behaving like any other human you ve known, that means something. They need an appointment with a psychiatrist. They need a diagnosis and they need a prescription. Indeed, Trump s mental health has been a great concern to many people. Even Dr. Drew and board-certified psychiatrist and Fox pundit Charles Krauthammer have weighed in on the subject.But regardless of why Trump is acting the way he is, the point is that it is far from presidential and should disqualify him from ever holding the office. America does not need a president who is easily provoked, especially when he will have the nuclear codes. We need a president who is good at working with others and has a calm steady hand. That person is not Donald Trump.Featured image via Salon",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" An 11-Year Old Girl Interviewed Hillary, And Her Answers Are Beautiful","Eleven-year-old Marley Dias always wanted to be our first woman president so she could work to fix problems in the world. Then she realized that she doesn t have to be president to start working on the world s problems, and she founded a book drive known as #1000BlackGirlBooks. She s been looking for stories about young, black girls for nearly the last year.Marley s now looking at possibly having our first female president before she s even old enough to vote, and she has a few questions for Hillary Clinton.Elle printed the interview in full, and Hillary replied to Marley the exact same way she would reply to anyone else interviewing her. However, she also seemed to try and relate her experiences in a way that will help Marley as she grows up.For instance, Marley asked her about her favorite books, including her favorite black girl book. On that subject, Hillary told her: One of my favorite authors is Maya Angelou, and I love her book I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. It tells the story of how Maya became such a strong, confident, determined person.Some parts are painful and hard to read, but of course that s the case in a lot of great books. And because Maya became a friend of mine in real life, it meant a lot to be able to read her story and understand her journey better. Hillary then quoted part of Angelou s  On The Pulse Of The Morning,  and finished with: Maya led a really difficult life, but she never forgot that each new day presented new opportunities. I m sure she felt afraid sometimes, just like we all do, but she didn t let her fears hold her back. That s a lesson I try to remember each and every day. As a black girl, who appears to already be growing into a strong black woman herself, knowing that Hillary has taken the experiences of someone like Maya Angelou and used them as inspiration to keep pushing forward, day after day, must be huge.We re not post-gender, and we re not post-racial either. Marley is growing up in a society that still currently sees her as very much less-than. Hillary is saying,  I was scared. You ll be scared. Things will get tough. But you can survive it and come out the other side stronger than you ever thought you could be. Here s how I know. Along those same lines, Marley also asked Hillary what advice she d give to her 11-year old self. Hillary said: I would say that when you have a big dream or you re trying to solve a big problem, there will always be people who tell you that you can t. Here s my advice: don t listen. Keep striving for your goals, and remember that it s good to be ambitious. There s nothing wrong with knowing what you want and going after it.And Marley, what you ve accomplished already is proof of that. Marley started #1000BlackGirlBooks because she was getting fed up with the books that her schools were having her read   they re classics, sure, but they almost always feature white boys as the main character. Black people particularly black girls are never a main character in these books. Yet, the books do exist and she was determined to bring them out into the light.Her book drive has already collected well over 4,000 titles a very impressive feat according to Hillary.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Stephen Colbert Just HAMMERED Trump For Asking Terminally Ill To Stay Alive to Vote for Him (TWEETS),"Donald Trump is concerned about the terminally ill   not about their ability to recover, their quality of life, the amount of pain they re in or if they re happy or sad, but he wants them to live until November 8. On Wednesday at a Nevada rally, Trump urged the terminally ill to  hang out till November  so they can assist in the destruction of the United States so they can vote for him. I don t care how sick you are,  The Donald said.  I don t care if you just came back from the doctor and he gave you the worst possible prognosis, meaning it s over. Doesn t matter. Hang out till November 8. Get out and vote. And then, all we re gonna say is,  We love you and we will remember you always,  Trump continued.  Get out and vote. Naturally, Stephen Colbert wasn t about to allow this to go unchecked. On Thursday. he tweeted a new campaign slogan for The Donald:Trump asked the terminally ill to hold on 'til Election Day to vote for him. He s revamped Diddy s slogan  Vote Or Die  to  Vote, Then Die.  Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) October 7, 2016This is what we can expect from Donald Trump s America   he will literally focus on whatever benefits himself as people die and the world burns around him.While it is doubtful that the terminally ill will be lining up to vote for him in November, many people will   make sure that you get out there and do your part to make sure our next president isn t a man whose sole concern is The Vote, no matter where it comes from.Featured image via screengrab/Getty Images (Ethan Miller)",News,"October 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Florida Governor Uses Hurricane Matthew As Excuse To Try And Help Trump Win,"Florida s Republican governor Rick Scott is not allowing the impending pressure of Hurricane Matthew to interrupt his partisan push on behalf of Donald Trump in his state. The storm is expected to disrupt day-to-day operations in the state at multiple levels, with multiple state and county agencies, as well as hundreds of private businesses, shutting down to ride out the weather event.The storm is sure to affect the impending deadline for voter registration on October 11. But when Democrats asked Governor Scott to extend the deadline as the population digs out from the storm, he decided to refuse.Republican Florida Governor Rick Scott on Thursday evening said the state will not extend an October 11 voter registration deadline. I m not going to extend it,  Scott said at a news conference on the storm.  Everybody has had plenty of time to register. I don t intend to make any changes. Scott is not a disinterested third party by any stretch. In addition to being a fellow Republican, Scott currently serves as the national chairman of a super PAC helping the Trump campaign, Rebuilding America Now.The governor s behavior is part of a long-standing election year pattern amongst many Republican officials, where they do whatever is in their power   often as Secretary of State or Governor   to ensure that as few Democrats as possible are eligibile to vote. In the south, particularly, a lot of these actions are targeted at counties with large black populations.The government of North Carolina was recently rebuked for designing a voter ID system that was designed from the ground-up to exclude voters from areas with black populations that were more likely to vote Democratic.Hurricane Matthew is expected to hit somewhere along the northern part of Palm Beach county and above, along Florida s east coast. That is an area of the state that leans more Democratic, and as such the storm path would impact that demographic.And it becomes very clear why the governor made the decision he has.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rudy Giuliani’s Daughter Announces She’s Backing Hillary Clinton,"Trump s biggest (and most insane) surrogate Rudy Giuliani just got some bad news   his daughter, Caroline, is backing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for President over Donald Trump, her father s new BFF.After posting on her Facebook that she has been  pro Hillary all along,  and making her profile picture Clinton s iconic H, Giuliani confirmed that the account was indeed hers and that her father, Rudy, does know:I love Hillary, I think she s by far the most qualified candidate that we ve had in a long while. My dad knows. I was for Barack in 2012. He knows and is fully comfortable with it and thinks I have a right to my opinion.She did not comment on her father s surrogacy or support for Trump. On her Facebook, after sharing an article titled,  I Wrote That I Despised Hillary Clinton. Today, I Publicly Want To Take That Back,  Giuliani wrote:I ve been pro-Hillary all along, but the people who are willing to open their minds & shift their perspectives are the ones with the power to save our country at this point, so I really respect this [the article]. #imwithher #voteAccording to Politico:The younger Giuliani is not the only one who has drifted from her father this election   the New York Times reported that many of the former mayor s most loyal former aides have rejected Trump s candidacy, and have expressed concerns about Giuliani s embrace of the Manhattan mogul and his more extreme views, specifically on immigration. Some of his former staffers, like his onetime press secretary Matt Higgins, have endorsed Clinton.It seems like Rudy is really off his rocker when everyone around him, including his own family, are voting for the other candidate.One has to wonder what Trump promised or paid Giuliani for his ardent (and downright insane) support.Featured image via Matt Millis McKnight/Getty Images",News,"October 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Paul Ryan Officially Hands What’s Left Of His Spine To Donald Trump (IMAGE),"It took Speaker of the House Paul Ryan quite a while to endorse GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. This is understandable; after all, the relationship between Ryan and Trump has been frosty at best. In fact, when the endorsement finally came, it was under cover a huge speech that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was giving. Further, since said endorsement Ryan has yet to appear on stage in public with Trump, and has avoided speaking about his party s vulgar, bombastic presidential nominee if at all possible. Before Trump took the nomination officially, Ryan called him out for many of his more inflammatory remarks   particularly his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, and his apparent inability to immediately disavow David Duke and The Ku Klux Klan. However, with Hillary steadily pulling ahead of Trump, Ryan is biting the bullet and caving under pressure of the Republican National Committee and the goons at the Trump campaign, and will finally appear in public with Trump.Ryan s office released a document to the press on Thursday, saying that Ryan would be at an event in his native Wisconsin. The memo is called, Paul Ryan to Attend Annual Fall Fest in Walworth County.  Along with Ryan, there s a list of other Republicans who will be there. And, buried under all the political talk, almost at the very end, the document confirms the worst: Trump will be there with bells on, too. Here is a screen capture of the document, via the Huffington Post:And pay special attention to the last line: All questions related to Mr. Trump should be directed to the Trump campaign. That right there goes to show that Ryan still can t stand the idea of talking about Trump, yet he has somehow been bullied into appearing in public with him.Speaker Ryan, you have NO SPINE LEFT. You have handed the battered bits of it that were left to the courier who delivered it on a silver platter to Trump Tower. It s Trump s party now, and you helped make that happen. The GOP is dead, and so is your political career. If you had stood up to your travesty of a nominee, if you had put country before party as any real leader would, you might have been able to avoid this situation.Good riddance, you sniveling, cowardly, Eddie Munster lookalike. I hope you not only lose your speakership in November, but your seat in Congress as well. After all, regardless of political party, real leaders have a spine.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"October 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Michelle Obama Makes The White House Garden Permanent, So Racists Called Her A ‘Gorilla’","The absolute hatred conservatives have for First Lady Michelle Obama knows no bounds and now we are being treated to another example of it. In 2009, Mrs. Obama planted a garden on the White House lawn in an effort to promote healthy eating and to encourage others to plant their own home gardens as well.But conservatives have complained ever since because for some reason they oppose healthy eating.It s been seven years since the garden was planted and it has flourished, expanding from 1,100 square feet to 2,800 square feet and now Michelle is protecting what she and the White House staff have spent years developing by making it permanent.As we all know, Donald Trump has vowed to reverse or overturn everything President Obama and the First Lady have ever done over the last eight years. That means Michelle Obama s garden could very well be plowed over just to spite Democrats and the Obama family. Conservatives would certainly cheer on this petty act. But Michelle has taken steps to ensure that the garden remains on the grounds for future First Families to enjoy by setting it in stone.With a stone walkway running through it and stone walls surrounding the plots consisting of steel and concrete, Michelle Obama officially dedicated the garden on Wednesday in a ceremony at the White House. This little garden will live on as a symbol of the hopes that we all hold of growing a healthier nation for our children,  Obama said.  I am hopeful that future first families will cherish this garden like we have, and that it will become one of our enduring White House traditions. In addition, a message etched in the stone reads,  White House Kitchen Garden, established in 2009 by First Lady Michelle Obama with the hope of growing a healthier nation for our children. Now the garden is a historic symbol representing President Obama and his family s time in the White House, which makes it far more difficult, if not impossible, for the next president to get rid of. And racist conservatives are enraged so much about it that they lost their shit and spewed hateful and racist remarks all over the internet.Here are some screenshots.And here are some tweets via Twitter.@gatewaypundit I ll bet her gardening is done by others & will stop in her privileged life outside of WH  Deplorable#22 (@donnakaye2014) October 6, 2016@gatewaypundit Woman grew up privileged but acts like she grew up poor in the ghetto, disgraceful person.

 Five Struggles Working Americans Face That Trump Will NEVER Understand,"In 2015, shortly after Donald Trump announced that he d be running for president, I went to one of his rallies in Sarasota, Florida. While standing outside of the rally it struck me as hilarious that the people who attended genuinely believed this self-proclaimed multi-billionaire was just like them. When Trump s helicopter flew over our heads with his name scrawled across it and he offered his supporters  children rides in his chopper, it cemented the fact that he was totally just like them! It was one of the most bizarre experiences of my life, and I live in Florida so that says a lot.In the months since that day, the same narrative has been repeated far and wide. At the Republican National Convention, Trump s daughter Ivanka told the GOP that her dad was the  people s champion. There is a Facebook page called  Trump  The People s President and there are blue-collar workers all over the country who think the real estate mogul is  just like us.  These people think that just because he is a loudmouth who lacks a vocal filter that he is some kind of  everyman,  but he s not.So, we have decided to compose a list of some of the things the working poor face every day that Trump has never had to deal with in his life.It is a fact that nowadays there is no chance of upward mobility without an education. This reality is the reason why Democrats are fighting so hard to make college free or at the very least, affordable, for every American. Although parents know that the only chance their kids have of achieving success is by going to college, when you are living below or just above the poverty line there is no way you can put money away for their college education. This is the reason we have 1.3 trillion dollars in student loan debt in the country and a student loan debt crisis. Donald Trump, however, has no idea what this is like. All of his children went to prestigious schools (the Wharton School and Georgetown) and so did he. He doesn t know the guilt you experience as a parent when you see your child stressed out about their mounting debt. He absolutely cannot wrap his mind around this and he isn t even talking about it in his campaign which proves that not only does he not understand it, he doesn t care.According to a 2015 Pew Research study, 11 percent of Americans said they take public transportation on a regular basis. The people who take the bus or subway on a regular basis are also more likely to be minorities or elderly who live below the poverty line:Among urban residents, 34% of blacks and 27% of Hispanics report taking public transit daily or weekly, compared with only 14% of whites. Foreign-born urban residents are more likely than urban dwellers born in the U.S. to regularly use public transportation (38% vs. 18%).Meanwhile, Trump  the everyman  flies around the country in a jet or uses a chauffeured car. This man has absolutely no idea what it feels like to wake up three hours before his shift at work so that he can make sure that he is on time. He has no idea what it is like to wait for the bus in a thunder or snow storm. He has no idea what it is like to sit next to weirdos who invade your personal space and stare at you. He has no idea what it is like to worry about whether or not he will have the $1.50 it costs to ride the bus. And again he isn t talking about this on the campaign trail and he is against raising the minimum wage.Since President Obama s Affordable Healthcare Act went into effect millions of Americans finally have the medical insurance they desperately need, but many still do not. More than 28 million people are still without insurance in our country. That means millions of people are not getting the annual physical exams they need to stay healthy this is not something Trump has to deal with. He has been seeing the same doctor for thirty years and even if he did not have medical insurance he could just pay his doctor bills without a second thought.Further, even though 9 in 10 Americans now have health coverage, that does not mean they have dental coverage:The Affordable Care Act (ACA) made dental care a required benefit for children s insurance, but it did not extend this requirement to insurance for adults. Therefore, many adults who buy non-group insurance may still have no dental coverage. In 2008, nearly 70 percent of people who bought health insurance on their own did not have dental coverage. And without dental coverage, many adults struggle to get the dental care they need.Trump has never woken up in the middle of the night in excruciating pain with a swollen face because of his inability to afford the dentist. He has never had to ask friends and family for money to have oral surgery. He has never searched his cabinets for old antibiotics. He has no fucking idea what that is like and wants to repeal the ACA.For millions of Americans the only way to survive is to apply for government assistance. The vast majority of the 52 million people receive help are hardworking Americans who just have too much month at the end of their money. They pay their taxes, work multiple jobs sometimes and just cannot stay afloat without help. And let me tell you, applying for it is the worst. Donald Trump has no idea what it is like to sit on pins and needles hoping the government deems you worthy of being able to purchase food. He has no idea what it feels like to go to bed hungry; and ironically, if he was ever put into a situation where he needed a hand up, he d be one of those  moochers  his party talks about all the time. You know the one, the person the GOP claims doesn t pay taxes but  expects  a hand out. Well, Trump hasn t paid taxes in almost 20 years making him the ultimate moocher.By now you have all heard about Donald Trump s visit to Flint, Michigan last month. Trump wanted the people of that city to know that he was on their side. His visit to the city came almost a year after America found out that the state had been poisoning the mostly African-American residents of the city for two years with lead-contaminated water. Trump, the guy who lives in penthouses and mansions has absolutely no idea what it is like to worry about drinking poisoned water. This is a very real struggle for not just the people of Flint, but in every state across the country according to reports. The idea that he can relate to this struggle is as preposterous as his visit to Flint. Furthermore, Trump is an anti-regulation Republican, so there is no chance in Hell that he is going to prevent this from happening in other cities around the country if elected.These are just five of the ways Trump is nothing like us, but there are many more. Trump also has no idea what it is like to run out of toothpaste or toilet paper and not have the money to buy more. He has no idea what it is like to look at his children and tell them that he cannot afford a $5 toy. He has no idea what it is like to not be able to get his children a pet because he cannot afford the vet bills. He has no idea what it is like to watch his children go off to war so that they can hopefully live through it and get a free education. He has no idea what it is like to go hungry, go without heat, go without shoes or any of the other things Americans face every single day.He is NOTHING like us and we must do everything we possibly can to keep him out of the White House.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Lindsey Graham Accept Defeat Over Trump: ‘I Can’t Go Where He’s Taking The Country’ (VIDEO),"Lindsey Graham has been one of the biggest Republican voices against GOP nominee Donald Trump, and he only grew louder as Trump gained more support. The South Carolina senator has had a hard time of it, too   he has called on Trump to apologize for several offensive things he s said, then he supported Trump briefly before aggressively crusading to get the Republican party to un-endorse Trump, and then he revealed that he himself would not be endorsing the humiliating candidate.Graham has been a nervous wreck over having to watch Trump destroy his beloved GOP right before his very eyes. But earlier today, Graham seemed to have finally accepted defeat and the fact that the Republican party he has known and loved will never be the same again. In an interview with At This Hour s Kate Bolduan and John Berman on CNN, Graham sorrowfully said: I ve come to the point now where I can t go where he is taking the party or the country. Graham also expressed that he was worried about what Trump s intentions were for America, but showed a brilliant amount of ignorance as he expressed he was open to the idea that Trump might grow as a politician (not happening). And to prove what a mess Trump s campaign really is, Graham brought up a talking point of Trump s, only be told by the hosts that it was actually an idea that came from Mike Pence, Trump s VP pick.You can watch Graham accept his circumstances below, and you can tell that it s absolutely killing him.Sen.

 Trump’s Lawyers Never Talked To Him Without A Corroborating Witness Because He Lies So Much,"Wow. That s a lot of lying.Apparently, Donald Trump is such a serial liar with a terrible memory that his own attorneys admitted that they always had to meet with him in pairs.According to a deposition released by Buzzfeed, bankruptcy attorney Patrick McGahn testified during the Trump Plaza bankruptcy case that his client lied so much that the firm made it a policy that a second attorney, identified as George Miller, had to be present as a corroborating witness. It s always been our practice to make sure that two people are present, and we don t have a problem of people lying He s an expert at interpreting things. Let s put it that way,  McGahn said,When asked if it was necessary for both of them to meet with Trump, McGahn said that it was. We tried to do it with Donald always if we could because Donald says certain things and then has a lack of memory. In other words, the Republican nominee says a lot of bullshit and has a memory like Ten Second Tom in Adam Sandler s 50 First Dates film.Here are images of the documents via Twitter.In depo for Trump Plaza bankruptcy case, Trump s own lawyer testifies they often met with him in pairs because Trump lies so much. pic.twitter.com/TdEkdf4ZiB  southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) October 6, 2016And Twitter users are having a field day with this.@nycsouthpaw @gmarie55 A sociopath lies incessantly to get their way, is often goal oriented and does so with little concern for others.

 Trump To The Terminally Ill: ‘I Don’t Care How Sick You Are’ (VIDEO),"The list of people GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump hasn t insulted keeps getting shorter and shorter. We know he regularly insults women and Muslims and Latinos and immigrants and African-Americans. Earlier in the week, he insulted veterans. He s mocked the disabled, and his latest tactless comment was directed toward literally on their death beds.In a rally in Nevada on Wednesday, Trump begged those who were dying to vote for him. Yes, those who were dying.I don t care how sick you are. I don t care if you just came back from the doctor and he gave you the worst possible prognosis, meaning it s over. You won t be around in two weeks. Doesn t matter. Hang out till November 8. Get out and vote. Then, Trump said he was kidding/not kidding.Mr Trump added:  I say kiddingly, but I mean it. He also reassured dying people that after they are gone,  All we re going to say is:  We love you and we will remember you always .Here s the video:People are not happy:One terminally ill person did respond, and it wasn t to support Trump:This one pretty much gets to the heart of it (or the lack of heart of Trump):As deeply offensive as this is, especially for anyone who either is sick or those who take care of the sick, there is a bit of refreshing honesty in Trump s joke/not joke.  I don t care  is perhaps the most truthful line he s uttered during his campaign full of lies. He genuinely doesn t care if people are sick. He doesn t care if people are suffering. He doesn t care if people are poor. He doesn t care about people at all.Donald Trump has a compulsive need for constant validation. He received fawning validation on the Apprentice. Now, he s taken his show to the American public and he expects the same from us. It s easy to imagine that Trump loves the idea of people dragging themselves from their death beds to do one last thing: pull the lever for Donald Trump. What greater ego validation is there?Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.",News,"October 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Makes Lame Attempt To Lecture His Fans And It Backfires HILARIOUSLY,"Wanna watch Donald Trump crash and burn in front of his own supporters?The Republican nominee held a rally in Reno, Nevada on Wednesday and took his pompousness to a whole new level by telling the crowd that they are mispronouncing the name of their state. Heroin overdoses are surging and meth overdoses in Neh-VAH-da,  Trump insultingly said.  Neh-VAH-da. When I came out here I said nobody says it the other way. It has to be Neh-VAH-da, right? Wrong. People in the crowd seemed genuinely confused and many were not happy about being lectured about how to pronounce the name of the state they live in, but that s exactly what Trump did and he was the one who was pronouncing it incorrectly. Trump even went so far as to jokingly claim that a friend of his  was killed  for pronouncing it the other way.Here s the video via YouTube.But  the other way  is exactly how it is supposed to be pronouned. It s Neh-VAD-ah, not Neh-VAH-da.Trump is hardly the first presidential candidate to make this mistake but he s the only one who did it in an insulting way while pompously lecturing the audience about how they say it wrong.And seeing as how Hillary Clinton is leading in Nevada right now it s not exactly the best time to be insulting the intelligence of Nevada residents, especially since Nevada is a battleground state that Republicans are desperate to win in November.Fox 11 anchor Ryan Kern couldn t believe what he was hearing.@realDonaldTrump tells a group of Nevadans how to pronounce their state correctly  and it s the wrong way.  Ryan Kern (@RyanKernKRNV) October 5, 2016And Nevada National Guard State Historian Emerson Marcus also pointed out that Trump was wrong.Wait. Did @realDonaldTrump just claim he pronounced  Nevada  correctly by mispronouncing it five times?

 Asian American Organizations RAIN HELL Upon Fox News For Racist Chinatown Segment,"Asian Americans are pissed off after Fox News ran a segment featuring racist Bill O Reilly goon Jesse Watters in Chinatown.O Reilly and Watters billed the edition of Watter s World as  good fun  and and mere  political humor. Watters literally strolled through New York City s Chinatown asking residents if they know karate and if they can  take care of North Korea for us.  Let s just say the segment pushed every stereotype about Asian people Watters and O Reilly could think of. Even O Reilly acknowledged that Fox News would get some letters.Here s the video via YouTube: [ad3media campaign= 1065 ]But they got WAY more than just some letters. The backlash has been swift and brutal as Asian American organizations from across the country condemn Fox News across the board for being so despicably and blatantly racist.Asian Americans Advancing Justice wrote, It is unconscionable that a news organization would sanction a segment that laughs at a community of people, including Watters ridiculing elderly Chinese Americans who were limited English proficient. Although The O Reilly Factor may believe this was  all in good fun,  the segment does nothing more than play up every offensive stereotype of Asian Americans that the community has fought against for decades. What they should have done is to talk about the important role that Asian Americans can play in this upcoming election. The Asian American Journalists Association also condemned the segment. The Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA) is outraged and shocked by the Oct. 3rd segment of  Watters  World  on Fox News   The O Reilly Factor.  The segment was billed as a report on Chinese Americans  views on the U.S. presidential election but it was rife with racist stereotypes, drew on thoughtless tropes and openly ridiculed Asian Americans It s 2016. We should be far beyond tired, racist stereotypes and targeting an ethnic group for humiliation and objectification on the basis of their race. Sadly, Fox News proves it has a long way to go in reporting on communities of color in a respectful and fair manner. The National Council of Asian Pacific Americans also slammed Fox News. It is not  all in good fun  to perpetuate racist stereotypes about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and it certainly is not  gentle fun  to target or mock people who are not fluent in English. No person should be used as a prop in such a heartless manner. Asian And Pacific Islander American Vote chimed in as well.Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote (APIAVote) is appalled by the recent  Watters  World  segment on The O Reilly Factor on Chinese American voters. The segment exploited Asian American stereotypes and exemplified the very issue of China-bashing the report supposedly sought to assess. This racist and derogatory segment damages Chinese American and Asian American communities and exacerbates negative stereotypes towards our communities.It is clear that the intent of this segment began from a desire to employ racist stereotypes to ridicule and mock Chinese American voters, and was never a serious attempt to understand the preferences or opinions of these voters after the first presidential debate.In addition, the Asian American Legal Defense Fund also had words for Fox via Twitter.This racist mocking of people in NY #Chinatown makes clear that @FoxNews doesn t care about Asian American voters. https://t.co/uTfr8WkoME  AsianAmericanLegal (@aaldef) October 5, 2016The Organization of Chinese Americans had even stronger words. This segment was grossly offensive to Chinese Americans and all Asian Pacific Americans who have ever had to suffer through the many false equivocations and damaging stereotypes that were mentioned in rapid-fire succession during the show. By going to the Chinese American community under the auspices of journalism and then unleashing a barrage of offensive stereotypes, Bill O Reilly, Jesse Watters, and Fox News have completely trivialized the community s view on this important election. At a time when politicians have fallen back on xenophobia to get ahead in the polls, it is disheartening to hear such offensive behavior come out of the media even as our power in the political process grows. Fox News should immediately disavow the segment and apologize to the Chinese American community for making a mockery of their language, culture, and political views. Fox News had better offer a sincere apology soon because they clearly pissed off a large segment of the population. Bill O Reilly and Jesse Watters should be ashamed of themselves and they should be removed from the network. But that would require that anyone at Fox News has a conscience.Featured Image: Dangerous Minds",News,"October 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sean Hannity Announces Megyn Kelly’s Support For Hillary Clinton,"Sean Hannity  went there.  In an argument with Megyn Kelly, he boldly announced that she supports Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump, with all due respect to my friend at 10:00, will go on Hannity and pretty much only Hannity and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days,  Kelly said Wednesday   a reference to The Donald s mission to avoid any and all press who won t spend all their time together fondling his tiny orange  wherever.  These days, that s pretty much just Sean Hannity, so Trump spends a lot of time using Fox News as a platform from which he can scream lies to the Stupid Part of America.Naturally, Hannity was upset that Kelly has a problem with this, tweeting that Kelly supports Hillary Clinton   you know, because only Clinton supporters can possibly have a problem with The Donald s actions.@megynkelly u should be mad at @HillaryClinton Clearly you support her.

 Mike Pence Just Crashed And Burned In HUMILIATING ‘Morning Joe’ Interview (VIDEO),"There are many things that are great about Thursday s Mike Pence interview on MSNBC s Morning Joe. The general uneasiness with which Pence discusses his running mate, the look on Mika Brzezinski s face when Mr. Joe tells Pence he  won the debate    but the best part is watching Pence completely crash and burn when attempting to answer very basic questions.When the discussion turned to Trump s policies, Brzezinski asked Pence about two of Trump s most well-known   the Muslim ban and his super-awesome Deportation Force. Pence explained simply that Immigration is our  deportation force  that will waste $600 million of your dollars deporting every single undocumented person in America. Pence, of course, did not mention the cost   just that we were going to make America great again with a wall and a border so secure it could protect that criminal Killary KKKlinton Adolf Hitler III s totally illegal email server.But when it came to the Muslim ban, Pence was spent. Done, man. Out. The uh, the position of our campaign, the position of our campaign, uh, is in in the interest of, uh, the safety and security of the people of the United States that we are going to suspend immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism. Not a  ban on all Muslims?  Scarborough interrupted as Pence was stammering on about Syria.After a long and awkward silence, Pence launched into his next mess of a string of sentences: Well, of course not,  he lied, explaining that  we can t know who those people are,  adding that if we allow people from Syria to take shelter from our mutual enemy   ISIS    we can t know for certain who these people are.

 WATCH: Trump’s Deplorable Fans Attack Mom And Her Disabled Daughter For Leaving Rally,"She was there to learn more about Donald Trump in order to decide who to vote for, but after the way Trump s fans treated her in front of her disabled daughter it s clear she won t be voting for him.Jennifer Mau took her daughter Chloe to a Trump rally in Colorado in an effort to make a more informed decision on Election Day. Mau is an independent voter and is unsure about who she wants to vote for, so she decided to attend the rally to hear Trump speak.Mau and her daughter sat with a group of disabled people during the rally, but Mau didn t stay long.After 20 minutes, it became clear that Trump wasn t the right candidate for her. But when she attempted to leave with her daughter, she was soon under siege from some really hateful supporters of the Republican nominee, some of whom were also disabled. When we were leaving, somebody said,  Why are you leaving?  and basically struck a nerve,  Mau recounted in an interview with Denver 7 News.  I said,  Why are you here? He makes fun of people like you. Mau was referencing an outrageous incident of Trump mocking a disabled reporter.According to Mau, Trump s supporters tried to make excuses for their candidate, but Mau s mind remained unchanged.Trump s supporters harassed her and yelled at her, and one even went so far as to tell her that she doesn t love her daughter if she doesn t support Trump. This lady is following me, screaming and yelling at me that if I loved my daughter I would vote for Trump and I need to get educated because he didn t mock somebody on purpose. It made me sad, made me want to vomit. Here s the video via YouTube.The Secret Service was forced to step in and escort Mau and her daughter out of the rally safely, but the ordeal left her daughter shaken.However, Trump lost more than one potential voter that day. As it turns out, some people actually walked out of the rally with Mau in disgust on how his hardcore supporters treated her.And while we don t know for sure who Mau will be voting for on November 8th, we can be sure that it won t be for Donald Trump.Once again, Trump s supporters prove that Hillary Clinton was right to call them deplorable.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WHOA: Fox News Just Went Full Racist In Chinatown With APPALLING Segment On Trump And Asians (VIDEO),"Fox News and the  O Reilly Factor  are well-known for their blatant racism, but they completely outdid themselves when they decided to visit Chinatown and create their most racist segment to date.Correspondent Jesse Watters took a little trip down to New York City s Chinatown to discuss the GOP nominee and this year s election. The result was one of the most offensive news segments to ever grace Fox News, which is really saying something.Mother Jones reports:The segment, which opens with stereotypical Chinese music, is spliced with movie clips featuring Asian actors speaking in exaggerated accents. Watters approaches a number of men and women in the street, some of them elderly residents who do not speak English. He then silently mocks them for their inability to answer his questions many of which wander from the presidential race to lame caricatures of Asians masquerading as humor. Is food in China just food? Do you know karate? Things actually manage to go downhill when Watters makes it back to the studio for a sit-down with the show s host, Bill O Reilly. Yes. Things actually managed to get worse.O Reilly notes that the majority of the people interviewed seemed to have a good understanding of what is going on in American politics. Watters seemed stunned. You thought people knew what was going on?  he asked with a laugh. They re such a polite people,  he said, pulling out yet another stereotype of Asian people.  They won t walk away or tell me to get out of here. They just sit there and don t say nothing! It isn t hard to see why Republicans have been losing support among the Asian community. O Reilly himself added that he knew there would be backlash for the racist segment and he is fully expecting to be bombarded by angry letters. Eventually, though, they came to the conclusion that who gives a f*ck because it was all in good fun.

 Trump Has Been BRIBING Government Officials For Decades (DETAILS),"While the amount of Trump s ahem charitable giving is under investigation courtesy of the Washington Post, his political contributions are coming under even worse scrutiny than that. In addition to his giving $25,000 to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi at the same time she was considering investigating Trump U. (which we re sure is just a coincidence), he s given donations to several other attorneys general who were weighing investigations into his businesses, too.There s a word for that. It s called bribes, and at least some of them are catalogued in the Wall Street Journal, which isn t exactly the most liberal publication out there. Trump and his associates have donated to the campaigns of attorneys general in New York for 30 years or more, up to and including Eric Schneiderman.Schneiderman is the attorney general who s ordered the Trump Foundation to stop soliciting donations immediately, and he s involved in one of the fraud cases against Trump U. WSJ discovered that the contributions to these campaigns all just happened to coincide with pending investigations into Trump s business dealings.Clearly, the bribes to Schneiderman didn t work   in fact, he returned them. Trump didn t like that and claimed that Schneiderman asked for the donations.One of those donations a $15,000 pledge to Robert Abrams back in 1985 came just as Trump needed to get Abrams  permission for three apartment-building conversions. While Abrams was unable to return that money, another former attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, returned them twice. The first time, it was because Trump had plans in Spitzer s office that were pending approval.The second time, however, it was because Trump was involved in a dispute with potential condo buyers who wanted their deposit back. Spitzer s office had jurisdiction over that case.Trump donated something like $60,000 to California Attorney General Kamala Harris, while she was considering investigating Trump U.Trump freely acknowledges that political donations buys influence, and puts himself out there as an  outsider candidate.  You can t be an outsider when you bribe politicians like this. When Rand Paul called him on that, he whined that Paul was taking him out of context.Oh, please.Featured image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" BREAKING: Secret GOP Polls Show Trump In TOTAL Collapse, Congressional Candidates Fear Wipeout","In the week since Donald Trump s complete collapse in his head to head debate with Hillary Clinton, nearly every national poll has shown the Republican nominee taking a complete nosedive. Polls have begun emerging showing Trump down 5-6 percent, and by as much in some polls as 10 percent against Clinton.And it might even be worse than it appears. Internal polls   which have a tendency to show the candidate paying for them in a better position than public polls   are reportedly showing a massive collapse for Trump.Mr. Trump has already slipped perceptibly in public polls, trailing widely this week in Pennsylvania and by smaller margins in Florida and North Carolina   three states he cannot afford to lose. But private polling by both parties shows an even more precipitous drop, especially among independent voters, moderate Republicans and women, according to a dozen strategists from both parties who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data was confidential.Liesl Hickey, a Republican strategist involved in several House races in swing states, said she was dismayed by a sudden exodus of independent voters in more diverse parts of the country. They are really starting to pull away from Trump,  said Ms. Hickey, describing his soaring unpopularity with independents as entering  uncharted territory. These voters are not responding well to Trump s unhinged attacks on former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who has become a symbol of the nominee s bias against women and Latinos. They also don t like the way he is engaging in gutter politics, by promising to bring up President Bill Clinton s marital infidelity.Yet Trump seems undeterred by the negative reception he s received for these proposals. Surrounded by a phalanx of  yes  men and women, Trump seems to believe that these lines of attack will work for him and expand his support beyond the uneducated older white males that are the bulk of his supporter.That probably isn t a good bet.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WaPo Reporter Calls Literally HUNDREDS Of Charities Searching For Proof Of Trump’s ‘Generosity’,"We ve heard nonstop from Donald Trump, and his family and campaign, how wonderfully, generously philanthropic he is. He has personally donated millions of dollars to various charities over  a number of years,  to hear them tell it. However, many are extremely skeptical of that claim, as well they should be. David Farenthold, of the Washington Post, has been investigating where at least some of that money has gone, and is coming up damn near empty-handed.Since Sept. 21, Farenthold has been calling charity, after charity, after charity, trying to find even one that s received money from Trump personally. To date, he s called 386 charities, everything from schools to AIDS charities, to religious foundations, and everything in between. Below is just a tiny sample of Farenthold s list:And many more. It s true that there are lot of charities telling Farenthold,  No comment,  but, well, gee, Trump s tax returns could settle that uncertainty. Too bad he won t release them and we have to go about discovering the truth the hard way.But we digress. A ton of other charities are saying,  Never,  though. In fact, between 2008 and now, Farenthold has found maybe $1 million or so in charitable donations from Trump.Trump, however, keeps insisting that he s given millions to charity, and apparently his people told Farenthold that he prefers to give  quietly  so that more charities won t find out and call him. Chris Christie claimed that Trump gave tens of millions of his own money, but Buzzfeed s Andrew Kaczynski says there s no proof of that.In an earlier story, the Post revealed that they d found less than $10,000 in charitable giving over a period of seven years. At the time that story ran, Trump s campaign was saying that there s no way for the press to  know or understand  his giving (again, releasing his tax returns would settle this). Despite a mounting body of evidence against him, the claim is, inexplicably, still there.We call bullshit, and it looks like the Post does too.Farenthold has been posting updates on his quest on Twitter, complete with photos of his notes:I ve been trying to find evidence that @realDonaldTrump gave any $ out of his own pocket between  08 and this May. Results so far: pic.twitter.com/JSggLbJcit  David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) September 21, 2016But that money could still be out there!

 Here’s Your Handy List Of Lies Lying Liar Mike Pence Told During The VP Debate,"It is widely believed that GOP vice presidential nominee Governor Mike Pence of Indiana won the one and only vice presidential debate of the season Tuesday night. After all, he was calm and smooth in the face of attack after attack from his opponent, Democratic presidential nominee Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. However, there s just one VERY BIG problem there: Pence flat-out lied throughout the debate. Well, this is likely something that people are just casual, general election political observers don t know. But, certainly pundits and political nerds knew this right away, and the non-partisan fact-checking operation Politifact was ready to call Pence out on his many, many lies. Here are just a few highlights:Pence:  Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement. We rated this claim Mostly False. In 2011, the Obama administration was negotiating with the Iraqi government to give American troops immunity prosecution by Iraqis   a touchy political issue.There s debate on whether the Americans could have worked out a deal, but Pence is wrong to suggest Clinton is to blame. The key decisions and discussions took place between the White House itself and Iraqi leaders.Pence:  They want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program. Clinton and Kaine have proposed a public option   a government-sponsored insurance plan   but they have not proposed single-payer. Clinton has consistently resisted going in that direction and instead proposes to work to prevent the repeal of Obamacare and try to improve on it.Pence s claim is Mostly False.Pence: Donald Trump  never said that  more nations should get nuclear weapons.Mostly False. Trump has said some countries, namely Japan and South Korea, might be  better off  if they were to develop nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. However, he has also said   often in the same interview   that he opposes nuclear proliferation in general.Pence:  We delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.This  ransom  line, which we ve previously heard from Trump, is Mostly False. Iran received the payment on the same day that American prisoners were released, but experts said this was not ransom. The United States owed Iran the money as part of a decades-long financial dispute.Pence:  Less than 10 cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes. This is a repeated Republican talking point and it s inaccurate. While it s true that the foundation gives away in grants a small fraction of its resources, about 87 percent of its expenses go toward services it provides directly.And that s just a few. The entire analysis of the truthfulness of the vice presidential candidates  claims can be found here at Politifact.Overall, Mike Pence had to walk a very difficult tight rope Tuesday night. While he might have won when it comes to a calm, cool style, he failed miserably on substance. Perhaps that is because when it comes down to it, his running mate is a racist, misogynist, pathological liar and a dangerous demagogue who should never be anywhere near the Oval Office. To that end, Pence s strategy seemed to be to insist that the more outrageous things that Donald Trump has said throughout this horrific travesty of a presidential campaign aren t true, and to run away from clearly indefensible positions. Or maybe he s just drank the Kool-Aid they regularly serve up at Trump Tower, and actually thinks he is telling the truth and being reasonable.Either way, it s insanity. Thank goodness for fact-checkers to help set the American people straight in this nightmare of a presidential election season.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Atlantic’s Endorsement SLAMS Trump, Indicts Him As One Of The Most Dangerous Candidates Ever","The Atlantic is a well-respected American publication. It also is one that tries with all its might to not be partisan when it comes to reporting on presidential politics. For this reason, the Atlantic usually refuses to endorse presidential candidates. The magazine has existed since 1857, and prides itself on being fact-based, morally sound, and non-partisan for the most part. They actually took sides for the first time in endorsing then-Republican candidate for president Abraham Lincoln, due to his position on slavery. To that endorsement, the paper said its reasoning for endorsing Lincoln was clear: a moral objection to slavery. The paper said of this endorsement:One of the animating causes of this magazine at its founding, in 1857, was the abolition of slavery, and Lowell argued that the Republican Party, and the man who was its standard-bearer in 1860, represented the only reasonable pathway out of the existential crisis then facing the country. In his endorsement of Abraham Lincoln for president, Lowell wrote, on behalf of the magazine,  It is in a moral aversion to slavery as a great wrong that the chief strength of the Republican party lies.  He went on to declare that Abraham Lincoln  had experience enough in public affairs to make him a statesman, and not enough to make him a politician. The second time The Atlantic endorsed a candidate for president also had to do with racism, when the endorsement for Lyndon B. Johnson was announced. The Atlantic s position then was, once again, less of a glowing heap of praise for Johnson, but rather against Barry Goldwater s rank racism. Then-editor Edward Weeks wrote at the time: We admire the President for the continuity with which he has maintained our foreign policy, a policy which became a worldwide responsibility at the time of the Marshall Plan. The magazine went on to write that President Johnson would deliver to America the solution  to the vexed problem of civil rights a power of conciliation which will prevent us from stumbling down the road taken by South Africa.  They went on to say of the known racist candidate they saw in Barry Goldwater:We think it unfortunate that Barry Goldwater takes criticism as a personal affront; we think it poisonous when his anger betrays him into denouncing what he calls the  radical  press by bracketing the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Izvestia. There speaks not the reason of the Southwest but the voice of Joseph McCarthy. We do not impugn Senator Goldwater s honesty. We sincerely distrust his factionalism and his capacity for judgment.And now, when faced with the possibility of a bigoted, dangerous demagogue as president, The Atlantic once again has taken a stand and endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Again, this has more to do with the dangers of a Trump administration than it has to do with Hillary herself. While the good folks at The Atlantic had plenty of praise for Hillary s public service record, their public endorsement is definitely focused on the indisputable dangers of Donald Trump. They said, in part:Donald Trump, on the other hand, has no record of public service and no qualifications for public office. His affect is that of an infomercial huckster; he traffics in conspiracy theories and racist invective; he is appallingly sexist; he is erratic, secretive, and xenophobic; he expresses admiration for authoritarian rulers, and evinces authoritarian tendencies himself. He is easily goaded, a poor quality for someone seeking control of America s nuclear arsenal. He is an enemy of fact-based discourse; he is ignorant of, and indifferent to, the Constitution; he appears not to read.This judgment is not limited to the editors of The Atlantic. A large number in fact, a number unparalleled since Goldwater s 1964 campaign of prominent policy makers and officeholders from the candidate s own party have publicly renounced him. Trump disqualified himself from public service long before he declared his presidential candidacy. In one of the more sordid episodes in modern American politics, Trump made himself the face of the so-called birther movement, which had as its immediate goal the demonization of the country s first African American president. Trump s larger goal, it seemed, was to stoke fear among white Americans of dark-skinned foreigners. He succeeded wildly in this; the fear he has aroused has brought him one step away from the presidency.The Atlantic s editors are right to do this. Trump is dangerous. The fact that a non-partisan, widely respected publication that has only taken sides in presidential politics three times since 1857 has such strong words against one major party candidate and in favor of another is very telling. They are telling us something that we should already know: a Donald Trump presidency isn t just embarrassing, or even just bigoted. It would be a reckless and dangerous affair that would literally amount to a national and international emergency.Sure, Independents and others who aren t necessarily on Team Hillary might have legitimate reasons for not taking the word of a clear Clinton supporter such as myself seriously. But you surely can, if only for a second, take a step back and consider the opinions of a paper like The Atlantic.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump’s ‘Charity’ Foundation Is About To Be Shut The F**k Down NATIONWIDE,"Things really aren t looking too great for Donald Trump s charity foundation. With recent developments prohibiting the Trump Foundation from soliciting funds in New York state, it s now looking like a good majority of states may be following suit.The Trump Foundation has also been being looked at by the Attorney General for how it is getting and spending funds, especially after what happen with veterans organizations earlier this year.According to The Daily Beast: To make matters worse for the Trump Foundation, the probe may not be limited to New York: Charity experts and lawyers tell The Daily Beast that the attorneys general of other states may soon get involved in a long, drawn-out process.All major charities are required to register with 41 different states across the nation in order to individually request permission to fundraise. When Trump raised money for veterans, he may have broken the rules in dozens of states. The president of the National Committee for Responsible Philanthropy, Aaron Dorfman, stated: The Trump Foundation would be required to file similar paperwork with the attorneys generals of nearly every other state, and they could all take similar action. It is likely that other states will follow suit and they will be issued cease and desist orders denying them fundraising privileges in other states. That is the most likely next step. This is not good news for Trump who keeps trying to pivot to slamming Hillary Clinton s Clinton Foundation. You know, the one that helps fight AIDS in nations globally.Trump, of course, likes to pretend that he s holier than thou, which might explain why Trump Foundation money was used to buy pictures of, well, himself.And according to Real Clear Politics: From 2011 through 2014, Trump harnessed his eponymous foundation to send at least $286,000 to influential conservative or policy groups, a RealClearPolitics review of the foundation s tax filings found. In many cases, this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided Trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible Republican candidate for president. Finding out Trump is a scam artist using a shell charity with his same name really should come as no surprise. Especially to fund his political ambitions of grandeur. However, it will be interesting to see how this story develops as the November election draws nearer.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BUSTED: Steel Unions FURIOUS At Trump For Destroying American Jobs,"If Trump wants to win the rust belt, he needs to practice what he preaches. After promising multiple times that under his Administration that jobs and business would be brought back to the steelworkers of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Minnesota, a new report detailed that Trump wasn t doing his part to make that happen (shocker, right?). Turns out Trump buys his steel   and aluminum   for his buildings from China, not the struggling rust belt states and communities.Let me guess: that makes him  smart. The Newsweek expose put a major dent in Trump s ability to coalesce blue collar, unionized steelworkers who typically vote Democratic but have been courted heavily by the Republican nominee.President of USW Local 1219, which represents workers at U.S. Steel s Edgar Thomson Works, Jim Johnston, slammed the nominee for failing to follow his own advice and promises at a press conference with other steelworkers and officials, saying:What he says really appeals to our members. But what he does is the total opposite.Braddock, Pennsylvania, which boomed in the 1920s as the epicenter of steel production but lost close to 90 percent of its population after the industry collapsed in the 1970s and 1980s, also felt the sting of Trump s double-talk. Mayor John Fetterman, a Democrat, laid into Trump s lies, telling the local press:Donald Trump pretends to be in the corner of steelworkers when the facts   as always with Donald Trump   show otherwise.If Donald Trump loses the support of the steelworkers, he can kiss Pennsylvania (and possibly Ohio) goodbye. With Hillary Clinton rising in the polls and making ground in the state, Trump will have to claw his way back after a series of devastating revelations about the candidate have been made public.Pennsylvania s next door neighbor, Ohio, is also not so forgiving, even among Republicans. Lourenco Goncalves, president and CEO of Cleveland-based Cliffs Natural Resources, said:It s just another example of who he is. He works for Donald Trump, not the common good. I m a Republican, but I just can t support a guy like Donald Trump.Just across the Great Lakes, in Minnesota, criticism has been sharper. USW President Leo W. Gerard went full anti-Trump in a statement to Duluth News Tribune:The USW, though not surprised by Trump s actions, is furious over his efforts to undercut key American manufacturing jobs in the construction of his buildings he so often brags about. The investigation from Newsweek released Monday is a shocking expose on Trump s plan to not only buy his steel and aluminum from the Chinese, but to use shell companies and corporate black holes to try and hide his greed even as he was planning to run for president.John Rebrovich, assistant to the director of USW District 11 in Minnesota, also told Duluth:We ve got 12,000 steelworkers at steel mills out of work and another 10,000 at aluminium mills and he s buying Chinese steel through shell companies. That s not making America great again. That s killing our jobs.Ouch. Trump s greatest chance on winning these traditionally Democratic states may have just completely turned against him, and for good reason. They have been ravaged enough. They don t need a bombastic billionaire promising them all these wonderful things when he doesn t even do his part to alleviate their suffering. Why didn t Trump contract these workers? Chances are he would have stiffed them, but even the extension of doing business would have meant the world to these hardworking Americans. But Trump, as usual, picks China to do his bidding.Featured image via Ralp Freso/Getty images",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 FACT: Donald Trump’s Education Plan Would Mass-Fire Teachers And DECIMATE Pell Grants,"If Donald Trump had his way, 14 percent of American teachers would lose their jobs. While the United States already faces a critical shortage of teachers not seen since the 1990s, Trump s plan would eliminate these crucial teaching positions as well as decimating Pell grants used by millions of students every year to achieve higher education.How would he do this? Trump, appeasing to the far-right fringe of the Republican Party, has pledged to eliminate the Department of Education. For years Republicans   from Ron Paul to Rick Perry   have been pushing for the elimination of not just the DOE, but other Departments as well.A recent study from the Center of American Progress Action Fund used statistical analysis to show what would happen if the Department of Education really was done away with as Trump so wants to do. Well, the results are horrifying:The list goes on and on. The idea to eliminate the Department of Education may look good to someone who wants  less government,  but in reality it s a cold and heartless move that s being pushed by billionaire proponents of school choice, like the Koch Brothers.The Learning Policy Institute attributes the shortage of teachers due to monies and entities being slashed from districts and states (and the federal level) during the Great Recession. After slashing, schools and teachers suffered. Now Trump wants to slash the buffer zone between complete privatization of our schools and a robust public option that has greatly enriched our nation.The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan fiscal entity, said of closing the Department of Education:U.S. high school graduation rates are hitting all-time highs; dropout rates are at historical lows; college going rates are close to the highest they have ever been; and test scores across the country are improving. But the elimination of the protections and resources from the Department of Education could significantly hinder or even reverse these gains.Trump won t listen. Instead he ll pander to his rich ultra-conservative buddies who have now propped him up in this election. If Trump has his way, say goodbye to our education system.Featured image via Theo Stroomer/Getty Images ",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders And Elizabeth Warren Drop BOMBSHELL On Wall Street Execs,"The Department of Justice has begun their criminal probe into Wells Fargo over the firing of 5,300 employees after said employees were coerced into opening over 2 million unauthorized accounts in an effort to boost their stock prices.As the criminal probe begins, 14 Senators, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren (whose video grilling CEO John Stumpf went viral) wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking that the investigation primarily focus on executives with the company, not lower level employees:Every time the Department of Justice settles a case of corporate fraud without holding individuals accountable, it reinforces the notion that the wealthy and powerful have purchased a higher class of justice for themselves. That s why the Wells Fargo investigation is so important.  Last week s Senate Banking Committee hearing with Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf raised serious questions that demand additional answers and point to potential individual wrongdoing  We are not in a position to determine if any of the senior executives at Wells Fargo committed criminal conduct.  That is ultimately the job of the Justice Department and courts.  But these facts raise questions about whether senior executives, including Mr. Stumpf, knowingly allowed illegal conduct to continue.Senators who signed the letter are Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, Dick Durbin, Al Franken, Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono, Angus King, Amy Klobuchar, Patrick Leahy, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Ron Wyden.Twelve Democrats and two Independents. Not a single Republican signed the letter.The letter states that Stumpf knew as early as 2013 that employees were opening up the illegal accounts but failed to disclose the information to investors and instead used the illegal accounts as a way to inflate stock prices. In other words, Stumpf was committing fraud.The end of the letter praises the actions taken by Warren s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but it still holds out hope that the DOJ will investigate executives personally:While the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency settlements in this case are a good first step toward providing restitution to Wells Fargo s customers, they are no substitute for a thorough Justice Department investigation into potential wrongdoing by senior executives at the bank.  We hope the Department follows through on its promise in the Yates memo and brings all the resources it has to bear on investigating the conduct of Wells Fargo s senior leadership.Sanders wrote a letter to regulators earlier, asking if any investigations against the executives personally were being conducted, saying,  Wall Street won t change until we make it clear that no bank is too big to fail and no CEO is too big to jail. So far, his questions remain unanswered. Hopefully, the letter sent by these progressive senators doesn t go unanswered.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: This May Be The Video That Ends Donald Trump’s Chance At The White House For Good,"If there s one thing the Donald Trump is good at, it s lying. However, here s the thing, he ll always get caught one way or another.Now, his lying is rubbing off on his vice presidential running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Lies so ridiculous and obvious, though, that it only took Huffington Post less than 12 hours to put together a video that is so damning it has the possibility of being the last straw for any voters still on the fence.The video literally does a point by point takedown of many, many lies that had been uttered throughout the vice presidential debate and pairs them with the truth of what the two men, Trump and Pence, have actually said.It really doesn t get more obvious than this clear depiction of the deception and constant lying to the American public that the Trump campaign has perpetuated since the very beginning.A Trump/Pence ticket isn t only bad for the United States, but for the entire world. They are lying liars and it absolutely needs to be exposed.Watch the epic takedown here:Donald Trump has said a lot of things. Mike Pence said he didn t say those things. He did.

 BUSTED: Trump Took Millions Of Dollars From Saudi Arabia Despite Saying He Would ‘Never’ Accept Their Money,"Remember when Fox host Sean Hannity directly asked Donald Trump if he would ever accept money from a country like Saudi Arabia that treats women, Christians, and Jews like shit and he said he wouldn t?Hannity began by claiming that the Clinton Foundation accepted $25 million from the Saudi Arabian government and Trump has repeatedly demanded that the charity give the money back.But Trump nor Hannity have any proof of their claim. And Politifact could not find any evidence that Hillary Clinton personally solicited funds from the Saudis. Saudi Arabia did donate at least $10 million to the foundation to contribute to the building of the Clinton presidential library, but the Saudis also donated the same amount toward building the George H. W. Bush library.Politifact further noted that the Saudi government never donated any money to the foundation while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, thus undermining Trump s accusations that Hillary was involved in a pay-to-play scheme with Saudi Arabia.But while Trump whined about the Clinton Foundation s relationship with the Saudis, he told Hannity that he wouldn t take money from them.Here s the video via YouTube just to jog your memory.Well, it turns out that Trump lied.Back in 2001, the Republican nominee did big business with Saudi Arabia and had absolutely no problem doing so.According to the New York Daily News,Trump sold the 45th floor of Trump World Tower to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for $4.5 million The five apartments included 10 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms at the time of the sale, and had yearly common charges of $85,585 for building amenities If those common charges remain the same, Trump was paid at least $5.7 million by the Saudi government since 2001.So while Trump attacks Hillary over donations made to the Clinton Foundation, he has literally been doing business with the Saudi government and taking millions of dollars from them since 2001.This is yet another example of how Trump doesn t practice what he preaches to his conservative fans.It s been revealed that Trump tried to do business with Fidel Castro s Cuba in direct violation of the embargo that has been in place for decades in response to Cuba s human rights record. Trump also does business with China by purchasing steel and other metals from companies there instead of companies in the United States, thus helping China topple American companies while screwing over American workers. Trump also furnishes his hotels with goods not made in the USA and even offers Qurans to any guest who requests one despite bashing Islam on the campaign trail.In short, Donald Trump is a lying hypocrite as usual.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Literally Turned This School’s Pep Rally To A ‘White Pride’ Rally (VIDEO),"If there is a single theme around this year s presidential contest, it s that suddenly, it s okay for Americans to let their racist freak flags fly high in the air. In case you thought most of those Trump-fueled racists were Baby Boomers and older, you d be wrong. A high school in Montana turned its annual homecoming event into a white pride rally.The annual competition is called  Color Wars.  Normally, that has a pretty innocuous meaning. Each class is assigned a color (black for seniors, white for juniors, blue for sophomores and green for freshman). Whichever class gets the most people to wear the colors wins.Like I said, normally, this is all in good fun, but this is the year of Trump, and well, white pride has risen again. Two juniors, a boy and a girl, wore white as they were supposed to, but with a little extra touch. Their t-shirts had  Trump 2016 White Pride  scrolled in sharpie on the backs.Photos showed that the front of the male student s shirt was covered with a Confederate flag and large red letters that spelled  REDNECK.

And for those young people who aren t racist, Trump is creating fear:It s producing an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color and inflaming racial and ethnic tensions in the classroom. Many students worry about being deported.Other students have been emboldened by the divisive, often juvenile rhetoric in the campaign. Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail.Source: Southern Poverty Law CenterIf this doesn t prove to otherwise reasonable Republicans that Trump is very, very dangerous for the future of the country, nothing will.Featured image via Twitter.

 Conservatives Are Seriously Claiming Kaine’s Marine Pin Is A Secret Communist Insult,"Republicans have officially sunk so low this election they couldn t possibly go deeper   or so you d think. Last night s vice presidential debate showed two men, one an honorable senator and the other a lap-dog governor, go at each other over policy and personal barbs. Republicans criticized Tim Kaine for interrupting too much (but were silent when Trump did the same thing to Hillary Clinton), and Donald Trump felt it necessary to, on Twitter of course, mock Kaine s personal appearance. Kellyanne Conway   who refuses to acknowledge Trump s record deficit with female voters   suggested Kaine was sexist.But perhaps the most deplorable of all insults hurdled at Tim Kaine s way comes from World Net Daily writer Jerome Corsi, PhD. Corsi   who  exposed President Obama s former life as a gay drug dealer   took to Twitter to denounce Kaine s pin, which is recognized by the Department of Defense for families with those serving in the military. Corsi referred to the sacred pin as  Ho Chi Minh,   Viet Cong,  and  Leftist secret squirrel stuff.  Corsi also accused Kaine of not respecting the military because the pin, he felt, was too narrow and didn t do enough to honor all those who have served   including those who have died waiting to receive care from the VA.Corsi deleted several tweets in response to other users, but luckily we got screenshots saved of the monstrosity:For a party that claims to support the military, the troops, military families, and veterans, they certainly have a hard time showing it. Corsi, along with the North Carolina GOP (which also mocked Kaine s pin as being communist sympathizing) shows how utterly heartless, foul and downright dirty the GOP can be. By all means, object to Kaine s policy ideas. Object to his running mate, Hillary Clinton. But the minute one trashes his son, and their Blue Star status, will be the minute of regret.So far, World Net Daily, Corsi s employer, has not denounced the comments, nor has any prominent member of the Republican Party. Yet Corsi still has a platform to spew his hate and mismanagement of the truth.Republicans, this election, have mocked Blue Star families, Gold Star families, war heroes, veterans with PTSD, our military, and so forth. Where will it end? When will Republicans stand up and denounce this outrageous, offensive, un-American hate that consumes their party?Featured image via Salon",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Historian: Trump And His Supporters Should Be Arrested For TREASON If They Refuse To Accept Defeat,"As Election Day continues to get closer on the calendar, some conservatives are already threatening to commit acts of violence if Hillary Clinton beats Donald Trump.In fact, conservatives, including Trump, have been laying the groundwork for months now to invalidate the election results in the event Donald Trump loses.The Republican nominee went to Pennsylvania in August and declared that the only way he can possibly lose Pennsylvania is if Hillary Clinton cheats to win the state. Ever since then, Trump s campaign and the Republicans that support him have been claiming that Clinton will somehow steak the election via election fraud, which suggests Trump and his conservative backers will refuse to gracefully accept defeat on Election Day and could go so far as to make threats and commit acts of violence in order to prevent Hillary from taking over as Commander-in-Chief.And such a move by conservatives would not only be unprecedented in the entire history of our nation, it would also be treason.Historian Dr. Ronald Feinman explained in an article published by History News Network that in all of our history, no losing presidential candidate has ever not accepted defeat in the wake of losing an election. There has never been a threat of a losing candidate refusing to accept the victory of his opponent, even in the midst of an oncoming Civil War, or in the midst of the Great Depression, or during the tensions of the Cold War years,  Feinman wrote.There is absolutely no excuse or justification for even a perceived possibility that Donald Trump might cause a major threat to civil order by encouraging his supporters to refuse to accept his defeat. Yet, we have some Republicans, including Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin seemingly setting the stage for possible civil disobedience and even violence based on the argument that Bill and Hillary Clinton are totally corrupt, and that no victory by Hillary Clinton would be valid. It is truly terrifying to think of the possible threat to the new President and Vice President by crazed supporters who use Trump s vehement opposition and potential rejection of the results as an excuse for bloodshed and violence, including a possible threat to the health, safety, and lives of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine.During the Values Voter Summit last month, Bevin called for bloody rebellion if Hillary Clinton wins in November. Somebody asked me yesterday, I did an interview and they said,  Do you think it s possible, if Hillary Clinton were to win the election, do you think it s possible that we ll be able to survive? That we would ever be able to recover as a nation? And while there are people who have stood on this stage and said we would not, I would beg to differ. But I will tell you this: I do think it would be possible, but at what price? At what price? The roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what? The blood, of who? The tyrants to be sure, but who else? The patriots. Whose blood will be shed? It may be that of those in this room. It might be that of our children and grandchildren. I have nine children. It breaks my heart to think that it might be their blood that is needed to redeem something, to reclaim something, that we through our apathy and our indifference have given away. Donald Trump has also suggested that  Second Amendment people  could  do something  to stop Hillary Clinton.This suggests that Trump and conservatives are planning to contest any election result that is not in their favor and are planning to cause chaos and commit violence if they don t get their way. This should be seen as a treasonable act, were it to occur, requiring the arrest, trial and incarceration of any Trump supporters, including the candidate himself, who represent a threat to constitutional order and American democracy,  Feinman continued.  Donald Trump would go down in history ever worse than his reputation has already been sullied by his actions and statements promoting division and chaos in America, and undermining its ability to protect national security. Being a  sore loser  who advocates or endorses violence and bloodshed would put him into a class with people such as Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr as traitors to the nation. Indeed, Trump and conservatives would be undermining our democracy and our tradition of peaceful transfers of political power which is why Americans must defeat Donald Trump by a landslide on November 8th in order to send a clear message to Trump and conservatives that their agenda is rejected and their behavior is totally unacceptable.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Former Accountant Breaks Silence To Shut Down Trump’s Tax Lies (VIDEO),"One of the most insane things about Republican nominee Donald Trump is that even when he massively f*cks up, he can t help but brag about how  smart  and  brilliant  he is! This has been especially true when it comes to his shady tax returns, which he still refuses to release to the American people despite several promises to be transparent.If you watched the first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton last week, you saw Trump shamelessly boast about how  smart  he was for not paying federal income taxes. And after recent reports discovered that the business mogul hasn t paid taxes in almost two decades, Trump claimed to have  brilliant , superior knowledge of America s tax codes, which allows him to manipulate the system to his advantage. Well, the truth is coming out now that an ex-accountant of Trump has come forward.Jack Mitnick, one of Trump s former accountants, has given an interview with Inside Edition that exposes another one of Trump s many lies. Mitnick was the accountant cited in the 1995 tax returns that were recently leaked, where Trump was shown to have lost a staggering one billion dollars in a year. According to Mitnick, Trump doesn t even know anything about taxes, even though he claims to. Mitnick said: I did all the tax preparation. He never saw the product until it was presented to him for signature  I m the one who did all the work. This sounds exactly like typical Trump   taking full credit for the hard work of other people. The only thing Trump did that was perhaps  smart  was to hire a savvy accountant   and yet he continues to try and convince America that his knowledge of how the tax system works makes him the better presidential candidate. It s seriously pathetic!You can watch Mitnick s interview below, in which he exposes Trump as a lying fraud:Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bernie Sanders Goes After Trump’s Tax Scam, Trump PISSED (TWEETS)","Just because Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is no longer in the presidential race does not mean he s stopped going after Republican nominee Donald Trump.Since his campaign ended, Sanders has been a major supporter of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and has been urging his massive following to get behind the former Secretary of State. But that s not all he s doing to save America from Trump   Sanders recently announced his plan to introduce legislation that will make it impossible for Trump continue to take advantage of tax loopholes.Trump s taxes have been a major topic throughout this entire campaign, as the business mogul continues to hold them hostage from the American people. However, the truth has been coming out little by little. Recent reports have stated that in 1995, Trump claimed a loss of almost one billion dollars on his tax returns, which may have enabled him to use legal tax loopholes to avoid paying federal income tax for 18 years! On Tuesday, Sanders said he would put an end to this: Special tax breaks and loopholes in a corrupt tax code enable billionaires and powerful corporations to avoid paying their fair share of taxes while sticking the burden on the middle class. It s time to create a tax system which is fair and which asks the wealthy and powerful to start paying their fair share of taxes.I will be introducing comprehensive legislation at the beginning of the next session of Congress to do just that. TwitterTwitterSanders believes his legislation will take care of the following loopholes that have been taken advantage of by people like Trump:For Trump, who bragged about how  smart  he was for not paying any taxes during the first presidential debate last week, this will be devastating.Featured image via Drew Angerer and David McNew / Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: How Mike Pence Totally Threw Trump Under The Bus At VP Debate (VIDEO),"While it was billed as a one-time-only clash between the vice presidential running mates, the real matchup at the vice presidential debate turned out not to be Mike Pence versus Tim Kaine after all.As this video from the group Correct the Record shows, Mike Pence spent more time slamming positions and statements held by his own running mate, Donald Trump, than either of the members of the Democratic ticket.Here s the video:[ad3media campaign= 1045 ]It was really stunning to see Pence again and again roll his eyes or exhale as Kaine recited Trump s bizarre rhetoric, only to use his response time to completely avoid defending Trump or offering up the most token resistance.It s no wonder that many observing the debate believe Pence s tactics have more to do with a possible presidential run in 2020 than any real interest in being Trump s vice president for 4-8 years.The thinking is that even on a losing ticket, Pence will have the sort of national exposure that would be impossible to earn through any other means. As the most recent Republican primary showed, a big name brand can conquer a field composed of Governors, Senators, and business leaders despite their credentials. Even as a siting governor, Pence would not have somewhere in the realm of 30 million people watching anything he could do as the leader of Indiana compared to number two on the presidential ticket.So while the strategy seems to hurt in the short term   whatever happened to party unity   it may be a play for the so-called  long game  in which Pence has a leg up over the post-Trump GOP field.That being said, it could just be an act of self-preservation on Pence s part. Not allying yourself with the man who attacks Muslims, Christians, and blacks is just good brand management, even though by simply being on the ticket, Pence is giving it validation in all its bigoted glory.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Eric Trump Tries To Defend Donald On Tax Evasion, Makes HUGE Mistake (VIDEO)","The topic of Donald Trump s taxes   or rather the lack of disclosure about Trump s taxes   was central to the 2016 vice presidential debate on Tuesday night. Appearing on CNN just as the debate ended, Trump s son Eric appeared in order to defend his father.Eric Trump tells @DanaBashCNN that Donald Trump  absolutely  pays federal income taxes https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/gm29AedxT4  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 5, 2016Host Dana Bash repeatedly asked the young Trump whether his father paid taxes, and if he would disclose his tax returns to the American people, something he has failed to do so far.In response, Eric Trump repeatedly claimed his dad paid  tremendous  amounts to the IRS and also asserted that he would disclose his tax forms.But reporting from the New York Times shows that when Trump reported a staggering near-$1 billion in losses in 1995, it very likely set him up to dodge paying taxes for the next 18 years. Trump took advantages of loopholes written into the tax code for wealthy real estate developers, and while Americans were sending troops off to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is very possible that Trump never contributed a dime in taxes to those efforts.Trump has evaded disclosing his taxes, something no candidate of either party has done since Richard Nixon, and as such has opened himself up to a ton of speculation. Without proof, questions continue to swirl around him. Did he evade taxes? What is the extent of his ties to Russian oligarchs? What other sources of income is he hiding on his returns? Is he actually a billionaire like he claims, or really a millionaire as other independent probes of his net worth have found? How much money has he shuttled into the so-called Trump Foundation, a vehicle he used to suck in money from other wealthy people, then used to buy baubles for himself while also donating money to some charities while claiming it was his own funds?Trump s son didn t answer any of these questions on CNN. He just kept on stammering about the money being  tremendous.

 Here’s The REAL Winner Of The Vice Presidential Debate,"So, aside from the GOP s premature statement that Pence won the debate tonight, who is really winning? Who is going to win when all is said and done? Probably The Onion and  The Daily Show. The Onion ran a story with the following headline:  Moderator Reminds Vice Presidential Debate Audience To Remain Silent When Exiting Early.  It was already assumed that this debate wouldn t have nearly the spirit of the presidential debates, but The Onion took it nine steps further with this  quote  from the moderator, Elaine Quijano: It s crucial that you stay in a single-file line and make sure to keep moving in an orderly fashion so the aisles are clear for others attempting to leave their seats. And please abstain from slamming the door so as not to disturb those audience members who are sleeping.  [emphasis mine] The Daily Show s  live feed included a picture of a glass of milk with a tie, and some toast with a tie:The allusion is to milquetoast, which refers to a 1920s comic book character, Caspar Milquetoast, who was timid, and now is a general reference to people who are meek or timid. Accompanying that image was audio from the actual debate. It s also an illustration that the VP candidates do seem to remain in the background of each campaign.The general expectation was a very boring debate and both of these demonstrate that expectation very well. However, we did end up with quite a bit of spirit between Kaine and Pence, probably a lot more than expected. Either way, it s pretty clear that it s The Onion and  The Daily Show  that won the debate tonight. Hands down.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 GOP Hilariously Tries Seeing The Future By Declaring Pence Winner Of VP Debate Before It Starts,"Nobody can accuse the GOP of having it all together, but they are pretty good at having their press releases done ahead of time. Unfortunately for them, tonight s announcement was about the Vice Presidential debate, declaring Mike Pence the winner, well before the debate even started.Check it out below   it s really amazing that they can see into the future:This is at least one  Dewey Defeats Truman  moment for the GOP. Back in 1948, the Chicago Tribune jumped the gun of the presidential election for that year and published that headline. Anybody who knows anything at all about American history should know we never had a President Dewey   and the Tribune has yet to live that gaffe down.The GOP, though, won t deal in facts tonight. They ll declare Pence the winner even if he literally never says a single word. Notice what they highlighted: The economy and Hillary s emails. Tonight s debate started with presidential leadership, and what the VP must do with zero prep should the president become incapacitated.Pence did do every single thing he could to blame Hillary Clinton for weak foreign policy, including lying through his teeth about why we pulled our troops out of Iraq (he repeated the GOP line that Hillary chose to pull our troops out and ignored the fact that it was not our choice   it was Iraq s choice). However, he s probably gotten some training from Trump s people, who try and turn even the most unrelated, irrelevant subjects into something about Hillary.Vox decided to be charitable with their evaluation of the GOP s premature ejaculation press release, saying it could be placeholder text on their site. But considering that they also said the  other clear winner  was Donald Trump, it s really, really hard to see this as anything other than what it is   the GOP trying to control the narrative before anything even began.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"October 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump LIVID After Legit National Poll Gives Him A Reality Check (IMAGES),"Just judging from Donald Trump s disastrous performance at the first presidential debate last week, it was clear that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton came out the winner. Trump couldn t give solid answers for any of the questions moderator Lester Holt asked, fact-checkers called him out for lying constantly, and his weaknesses on policy were exposed for all to see. Still, Trump insisted for days that he d won the debate and that he was rising in the polls, all while citing inaccurate or bogus statistics.A new national poll has come out to set the record straight. According to the latest NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll, Clinton is ahead of Trump, 46% to 40%   and unlike any of Trump s polls, it s actually legit. Here s how the election is panning out so far:Now, Trump is probably going to claim that this poll (AND this election, AND the upcoming debate) is  rigged    because he always comes up with an excuse for why he sucks. But the truth is, Trump only has himself to blame.This poll also discovered that one of the main reasons Trump is failing so hard is because he s destroyed his chances of appealing to women. Last election, women accounted for 53% of voters   and you can bet that more women than ever will come out to vote in November to prevent the most misogynistic presidential candidate from getting into the White House. Thanks to Trump s sexist, degrading and objectifying attacks and comments, Trump has pretty much excluded women from his fan base. Even GOP women hate him!This was especially true for women who were not married. Trump s standing with minorities is even more horrendous. He has never even been able to leave the single digits when it comes to African American voters!Good job, Trump! You re in the home stretch of the election, and you re destroying your campaign by the day.

 Mike Pence VICIOUSLY Refused To Pardon Black Man Wrongfully Imprisoned For 10 Years,"Republicans are so scared and desperate about the Pence-Kaine debate that they ve resorted to distorting Tim Kaine s record as a defense attorney   in which, yes, he had to defend murderers. But anyone who took a civics course (or has half a brain cell) knows that everyone, even accused murderers, are entitled to representation in a court of law.It s 2016, why is that still being debated?Seeing as though there s nothing shocking about that drummed up  scandal,  a real scandal lies on the horizon, and it has to do not with Tim Kaine, but Mike Pence.After serving 10 years of a 40 year sentence, Keith Cooper   who was accused of shooting Michael Kershner and his mother, Nona Canell   was found to be innocent after the victims admitted they were wrong, DNA evidence proved he was not at the scene, and a jail informant admitted to lying.After filing a pardon request, in which the board unanimously voted that Pence should indeed pardon Mr. Cooper, Pence balked. Why? [O]ut of respect for the judicial process,  Pence claimed, saying that Cooper s paperwork wasn t  in order  after a two year delay by the state. Pence s office admitted they haven t given th case much thought, but somehow thought it appropriate to slam Cooper s lawyer, saying they need to  do a better job. Cooper s attorney, Elliot Solsar, then claimed Pence bucked the case because he s running for president, and is instead trying to pass it off to his successor (if he wins in November):We are really disappointed in Governor Pence s failure to provide justice to an innocent man. It s clear that he has punted the petition to the next Governor because it s election season.Is that what Trump, Pence s running mate, means when he says they are the  law and order candidates? I wonder if the circumstances would be different if Cooper were white, instead of a black man. Black people, after all, are wrongfully convicted at higher rates than white people:The National Registry currently cites a total of 1,417 exonerations   the majority of which are attributed to Black defendants.By the Registry s own statistics broken down by race and crime, total exonerations for  all crimes  numbered 164 for Hispanic persons, 556 for Caucasian persons, and 662 for Black persons. The largest gap is associated with sexual assault (a difference of 78 exonerations), with the second largest belonging to homicide (a difference of 59 exonerations).Not only are black people more likely to be victims of wrongful conviction, they also wait longer to exonerating than others.In 2014, Pamela Perez, professor of biostatistics at Loma Linda University, told the Huffington Post:Blacks who are exonerated after a bogus conviction have served 12.68 years on average before the good news. It takes just 9.4 years for whites and 7.87 for Latinos.Racist governors like Mike Pence, while being stubborn and cruel, continue this system that has shown to be immoral, unfair, and unethical towards black Americans in modern society.Tim Kaine would be wise to bring this major issue up at the first debate.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservative Writer Calls Black Voters Hillary’s ‘Loyal Slaves’ For Not Blindly Supporting Donald Trump,"When conservatives refer to black people as  slaves  it totally undermines what little effort they put into trying to get their votes.But a conservative writer did exactly that in a racist article published by Mediaite on Tuesday in an attack on Lebron James and Mary J. Blige for endorsing Hillary Clinton.In the opinion piece titled  LeBron James, Mary J. Blige Tell Blacks to Remain Slaves to Hillary; Vote Their Color Not Their Conscience,  author Crystal Wright referenced slavery and compared blacks to livestock right out of the gate in support of Donald Trump. Slavery ended in 1865,  Wright began.  Yet blacks still act like the political chattel of the Democrat [sic] Party. Each election cycle blacks allow the Democrat Party and its proxies to tell them how to vote, and they follow orders like loyal slaves. The 2016 election is turning out to be no different. Wright then goes on to whine about Lebron James s recent endorsement of Hillary Clinton. When I look at this year s presidential race, it s clear which candidate believes the same thing,  James said.  Only one person running truly understands the struggles of an Akron child born into poverty. And when I think about the kinds of policies and ideas the kids in my foundation need from our government, the choice is clear. That choice is Hillary Clinton. How does Hillary understand the struggle of a black kid born into poverty, as James wrote, when she s spent her entire 30-year career as a politician doing nothing to fix the problem?  Wright responded.Let s start by pointing out that Hillary Clinton has been a lifelong advocate for ending poverty, something the Clinton Administration actually made significant progress in achieving during the 1990s.In 1990, 29 percent of black families lived in poverty. But during the Clinton years when the economy boomed, that percentage was cut to only 19 percent, which is the lowest it has been in the last 50 years.Similarly, poverty stricken black families headed by single women also dropped to all-time lows during the Clinton years, from 48 percent in 1990 to 34 percent in 2000.By the time the Clintons left the White House, more African-American had been lifted out of poverty than during any other presidency, but those gains were soon reversed after Republicans took over in January 2001.In short, why should black voters risk things getting even worse under Trump when they can put a woman in the White House who was there when things were getting better?But Wright wasn t done insulting black voters. Of course, we know LeBron s op-ed is directed only to blacks,  she continued.  Because white people don t look to professional athletes for voting instructions. White Americans are not a monolithic voting group, which is why their vote influences policy. LeBron James did not instruct black people to vote for Clinton. He asked them along with everyone else. That s because James has white fans, Hispanic fans, and female fans, too. Just because he is black doesn t mean he only has black fans. Assuming otherwise is blatantly racist. Also, assuming that white people are not influenced by athletes is just ridiculous.Wright then concludes by telling black people to vote for Trump.As for Hillary, she is no more viable a candidate for blacks than she is for women. The only life that matters to Hillary is her own, and a career-long obsession with winning the office she s coveted for a lifetime.Yet celebrities like LeBron James want blacks to feel good voting for their color over their conscience. What do blacks have to lose voting for Trump? Absolutely nothing.Actually, black people have everything to lose if Trump wins.When the conservative-controlled Supreme Court struck down a key portion of the Voting Rights Act, it was a signal that Republicans intend to tear down landmark legislation that protects the constitutional rights of African-Americans. Republicans, including Trump, have also called for repealing the 14th Amendment, which overturned the Dred Scott ruling that Americans descended from African slaves can t be United States citizens.Furthermore, Republicans have enacted voter suppression laws in several states, which primarily targets black people.Also, Trump s track record with black people is pretty shitty. For one, he s only just now beginning to reach out to them, but that s only because his poll numbers suck and he is desperate. But he called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, who spent years in prison for a rape they did not commit. And Trump was sued in the 1970s for refusing to rent to black people. Plus, unlike the Clintons, Trump has no record to offer as reasons why black people should vote for him. Hillary Clinton does.Clinton is still a champion for reducing poverty and caring for children and families. And her husband s economic policies helped lift millions of blacks out of poverty. Wright talks about black voters as if they are mindless drones on some kind of modern plantation. But the fact is that Democrats have fought for equality and civil rights for decades while Republicans have done nothing but stand in the way or try to roll back the progress made. While Democrats have worked hard to earn the support of black voters, Republicans turned their backs on them a long time ago and have done nothing over the last century to earn back their support. Donald Trump will not change that, especially when his biggest supporters are white supremacists.Calling black people slaves just because they support a certain party is reprehensible and it s a reason why black voters reject conservatives. But you can be certain that Trump s KKK buddies are absolutely thrilled about Wright s words. After all, they really do want black people to be slaves.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 DESPERATE Senate Republicans Just Dropped Pro-Hillary Bombshell Onto Trump’s Head,"No matter how much they don t want to admit it to be true, many Republicans, especially in Congress, know Hillary Clinton is the better choice for president despite what they may say publicly.Oh sure, they ll fall in line behind Donald Trump for the sake of the party, but do they really believe the reality television host and floundering businessman will make a good Commander-in-Chief?Proving this point, several GOP Senators are even admitting that they know Hillary will be good to work with.Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that he s worked with Hillary in the past and sees a similar future: The one thing you have to remember is that for five years she was Secretary of State while we were in the Senate. We had to work together an awful lot while members of the Foreign Relations Committee and also as members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Adding that it will be much different than when President Obama took office: Barack Obama was somewhat of an unknown   he was a senator, but only for a year-and-a-half before he was elected president. She is a known commodity, and I think there ll be more camaraderie in terms of working together, than there might have been in the early days of Obama. As we can all probably recall, there was little to no respect for President Obama from the Republican side of the aisle in both the House and the Senate. In fact, it seemed their number one priority was to block any and everything he tried to get accomplished.Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) said of a Hillary Clinton presidency: We ll do our duty, you know regardless of who is president. The people we serve want us to to work together for their benefit so that s certainly my posture. Even Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) admitted that he s worked with Hillary in the past and that she d be a  willing partner  on things such as immigration reform and federal spending.Now, of course, most Republicans will still tell you that Donald Trump will win, but they are clearly, and rightfully, preparing for a Hillary Clinton presidency. Because let s be real, that s not only the most likely case scenario but also what will be best for the nation overall.Featured Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"October 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary’s Worst Enemy Just Endorsed Her Because Trump Is THAT Bad,"In a surprising twist, former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff announced that he will be throwing his support behind Hillary Clinton rather than Donald Trump.Chertoff s endorsement isn t shocking just because of his work with President George W. Bush s administration or because he is a prominent Republican. Indeed, in this respect, he simply joins an ever-growing list of influential conservatives and ex-Bush officials who have decided that they simply cannot support the GOP s orange-hued nominee.Chertoff s support comes as such a surprise because he was one of the prosecutors during the congressional investigation into the Whitewater controversy, which involved the Clintons and their real estate investments.Chertoff, who served as the lead GOP counsel on the Senate Whitewater Committee, told Bloomberg that threats of terrorism override all the  insignificant  issues that were so prominent in the 90s. And with these threats in mind, Hillary Clinton is clearly the better option for the presidency. I realized we spent a huge amount of time in the  90s on issues that were much less important than what was brewing in terms of terrorism. [Clinton] has good judgment and a strategic vision of how to deal with the threats that face us,  he said. People can go back decades and perhaps criticize some of the judgments that were made. That is very, very insignificant compared to the fundamental issue of how to protect the country. The breaking point for Chertoff was last week s presidential debate. Trump s sense of loyalties are misplaced,  he said. Chertoff said he will be backing Clinton and cited various comments Trump has made about foreign policy as his primary reason. Some of our NATO allies sent troops overseas. At the same time, he is defending Russia and trying to dismiss what was widely acknowledged to be Russian intrusions into the databases of our political parties and political figures,  Chertoff explained.According to the long-time Republican, Trump s comments about Russia during the debate were the equivalent of making enemies of your friends and cozying up to your adversaries. Trump s fat-shaming of a former Miss Universe didn t sit well with Chertoff either. This issue came up at the debate about Miss Universe,  he said, referring to Alicia Machado, a Clinton supporter. Not only did he seem at the debate to lose his temper, but to get up at 3:30 a.m. and reach for your smartphone is to me a hysterical reaction,  Chertoff said of Trump s late-night Twitter tantrum.  If you re president, the button you reach for is not the Twitter button; it s the nuclear button.

 Eric Trump PATHETICALLY Attempts To Defend Daddy’s Latest 3 A.M. Temper Tantrum On Twitter,"Everyone involved with Donald Trump s campaign seems to have one job, and it s the same job: Explaining why whatever completely horrible thing Trump said or did, this time, is really totally okay. Today, it s Eric Trump s turn to justify daddy s latest 3 a.m. temper tantrum on Twitter, in which he told voters to  check out  a former Miss Universe s non-existent  sex tape. Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Eric said that at least it proves his father doesn t sleep, even though this can admittedly be a  downfall  sometimes. At least my father s up at 3 o clock in the morning, right? Which, you know, is great. Maybe that energy is sometimes a little bit of a downfall of his, but he s an amazing guy, and he ll be there to answer the call, you know, when things go bad. And, you know, I think people appreciate that. Not everyone sees Trump s lack of sleep as a virtue, though. Some of The Donald s opponents say his late night Twitter rants are proof of just how unfit for office he is. What kind of a man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories?  his rival Hillary Clinton asked last week.Vice President Joe Biden took aim at Trump s early morning tweetstorm on Monday during a rally in Orlando, Fl. You don t have to be a psychologist or psychiatrist. But what kind of leader awakens at 3 o clock in the morning and tweets Hillary helped  disgusting Alicia M. become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in a debate ? Or 3:30 in the morning. This guy wants to be president of the United States of America?  Biden said.In Trump s Twitter rant, he claimed that Clinton had been  duped  by Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe who had been fat-shamed by the GOP nominee and suggested that the Democratic nominee had helped her gain citizenship.Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an ""angel"" without checking her past, which is terrible!  Donald J.

 REPORT: Trump Illegally Used Charity Money To Jumpstart Presidential Campaign,"A new report from RealClearPolitics is detailing what might be another illegal endeavor of Donald Trump at the behest of his  charitable foundation  (which has already been caught illegally using funds to pay off lawsuits).From 2011 to 2014, leading up to his presidential announcement (and speculation in 2012), the Trump Foundation donated nearly $300,000 to various conservative groups and organizations.IRS laws clearly state that charity executives may not use a foundation  funds to finance personal endeavors that benefit said executives.In 2011, Trump met with South Carolina conservative activist Oran Smith with the intent for, as Smith puts it,  laying the foundation for a   campaign.  After the meeting between the two, Trump, using foundation money, donated $10,000 to Smith s organization, the Palmetto Family Council.According to RealClearPolitics:In many cases, this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided Trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible Republican candidate for president. Although sources familiar with the thinking behind the donations cautioned that Trump did not explicitly ask for favors in return for the money, they said the contributions were part of a deliberate effort by Trump to ingratiate himself with influential conservatives and brighten his political prospects.Talk about real pay-for-play.Using Foundation money to monetarily influence, even slightly, those who could (and would) catapult his political career (a personal endeavor) is still illegal under IRS laws   no matter how many technicalities Trump and his lawyers want to argue.In almost all instances, these conservative organizations, with considerable political influence, invited the billionaire mogul and provided endorsements after he donated thousands of dollars to their cause.Another high profile donation was made to The Family Leader organization, a socially conservative think tank that featured Trump as a keynote speaker at one of their most prestigious events in 2013. Trump was featured as the keynote speaker after giving $10,000 like he did with the Palmetto Family Council. RealClearPolitics points out that Trump may have broken IRS rules by giving directly to the organization and not its affiliated nonprofit branch, thus pitting Trump in a  double whammy  on unethical, illegal political meanderings.After Trump donated $100,000 to Citizens United, a Koch-backed political entity:In April 2014, when Citizens United hosted a  cattle call  of would-be Republican candidates for president in New Hampshire, Trump was there. In January 2015, at Citizens United s Freedom Summit in Iowa, Trump was again on the program.This won t bode well, especially for a guy who s  under audit  from the IRS. We now know why, apparently.While Republicans try to find something, anything, to pit Clinton against her foundation, the GOP is ignoring the obvious abuses of Trump and his. This double standard from the right should not surprise anyone   their candidate is failing and they need to divert any negative attention away from him. This is the party of  Christian values  at work.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"October 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republican Kelly Ayotte Gets BRUTALLY Trolled For Calling Trump A Role Model For Kids,"During a debate in New Hampshire, Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte was asked if she would tell her kids to be like Donald Trump, who is a sexist bigot who says and does outrageous things every day: I think that certainly there are many role models that we have and I believe he can serve as president, and so absolutely I would do that,  she responded.Well, that didn t make New Hampshire voters very happy at all.So, Ayotte, who is in a tight race against Democratic opponent Governor Maggie Hassan, was forced to back away from the remark entirely, apparently hoping voters are stupid enough to believe that she misspoke. I misspoke tonight,  Ayotte wrote on Twitter.

 Biden DESTROYS Trump After He Insults Veterans (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is on the receiving end of a gigantic tongue-lashing from Vide President Joe Biden after Trump made yet another set of offensive comments about American combat veterans.Speaking in front of veterans at an event organized by a right-wing PAC, Trump said veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder were perhaps weak.Trump Monday tried to praise his veteran-heavy audience as  strong  because they didn t have PTSD while he talked up getting more help to veterans. When people come back from war and combat and they see maybe what the people in this room have seen many times over, and you re strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can t handle it,  Trump told the Retired American Warriors PAC in Virginia.Almost right away, Trump received strong condemnation for his remarks, the latest major mistake from a presidential campaign that has been one screw-up after another.But the harshest words on Monday came from Biden, who was speaking at a rally in support of Hillary Clinton in Orlando.[ad3media campaign= 1030 ] Where in the hell is he from?  Biden, who has been  in and out  of Afghanistan and Iran dozens of times, told the audience.Biden added that this country has only one  sacred obligation : to  care for those we send to war and to care for them and their family when they come home. What are the chances Trump honors commitment to those who are wounded?  Biden said, at one point near shouting into the microphone.  It s not just that he doesn t get it. He doesn t want to find out. The Vice President also spoke about the military service of his late son, Beau, who was an officer in the Army s Judge Advocate General Corps. Beau s unit was deployed to service in Iraq in 2008, while his father was first campaigning with Obama as his running mate.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ivanka Just Fell Flat On Her Face Trying To Convince Women Fall In Line Behind Her Dad (VIDEO),"Ivanka Trump has been sort of the female face of her father s campaign, but despite being a woman, she really doesn t get it. That s quite evident in her new video touting her father s childcare plan, which she kicks off with following gender stereotyping words: The most important job any woman can have is being a mother. That is the height of irony, considering the fact that this video is directed towards working mothers. Working mothers value their jobs and their children, and many resent being shunted into sexist gender roles like this. Such a dismissive attitude toward women, both mothers and non-mothers, will do nothing to warm them up to Trump at all.But wait! There s more. Ivanka goes on to say: Donald Trump understands the needs of the modern workforce. Har de har har. Don t make us laugh too hard, it hurts. Ivanka s father once said that pregnancy is an inconvenience for business, and told a woman she was disgusting for needing to pump her breasts. He s a serial cheater, a serial sexual harasser, and a serial body-shamer.The AP published a story earlier today that exposes Trump s harassment of women on the set of  The Apprentice.  According to that story, he rated women contestants on the size of their breasts, and openly talked about which ones he d like to sleep with. He also wanted them to bare more cleavage and wear shorter skirts, and asked one woman to twirl for him so he could ogle her figure.As a woman who, at a previous job, was repeatedly asked to twirl around so a manager could ogle my figure before he d even answer a question I had, these revelations make me positively ill.Trump even compared a camerawoman s looks to the beauty of Ivanka on the set of  The Apprentice. Ivanka hasn t had a very good role model for a father, let alone for anything to do with feminism and women s rights. Trump always saw his parental duties as limited to providing funds for his children. He never actually parented, and he s said both of the following to boot: I mean, I won t do anything to take care of them. I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. It s not like I m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park. Marla used to say,  I can t believe you re not walking Tiffany down the street,  you know in a carriage. Right, I m gonna be walking down Fifth Avenue with a baby in a carriage. It just didn t work. And: There s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife and you know there s a lot of husbands that listen to that  I m really like a great father but certain things you do and certain things you don t. It s just not for me. This is understanding the needs of working mothers, women, and the modern workforce? Not hardly.Ivanka is in awe of her father, it seems, and carries a ton of internalized misogyny because of him and because of society. She s ill-equipped to reach out to women on this level on behalf of her father, because that takes a lot more than simply being a female face.Watch the entire ad below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"October 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Obama Girls Are Going To Be Bridesmaids, So Conservatives Called Them ‘N*****s’ (SCREENSHOTS)","Good news, everyone! Michelle Obama s former assistant, Kristen Jarvis, is getting married to one of the President s former Secret Service agents. While the President himself will not be attending, Michelle Obama is expected to make an appearance   and Malia and Sasha Obama are even going to be bridesmaids! It s sure to be a beautiful wedding and everyone involved is sure to have fun   but of course conservatives have to sh*t all over everything beautiful.When TMZ reported the story, some of Trump s  deplorables  jumped right out of their basket to let the world know why Hillary Clinton was justified in calling them that to begin with.This fine person really wants the White House to be white again. Welfare Mammy    probably not a real name   thinks the Obama family are a  bunch of n-words. President Trump  (we re trying to figure out which candidate he supports) is just an outright racist. Max  agrees with Mr. President s primate theory. Freedom  is very passionate about this issue, even postulating that the Obamas are  all f*cking each other.   The rest are just deplorable.    The Right jumps on the Obama girls every chance they get   including when Malia graduated high school and again when she was accepted to Harvard, and when the girls hang out with their friends  they even wished rape on Sasha Obama when she turned 15 years old.All of these people will be voting in November.

 WATCH: Video Shows Cops TRYING To Run Over Black Man With Cruiser,"In something you might expect from a video game instead of real life, police in Sacramento, California are under fire on Monday after a dash cam video was released that showed police trying to run down a black man who reportedly had only a knife. They missed, but they did manage to shoot 50-year-old Joseph Mann 14 times. Now, the community is calling for the police involved to be charged with murder.The incident happened on July 11th. As those on the right will happily point out, the police were called to an apartment complex because Mann was reportedly acting erratically and he had a knife. When police ordered Mann to drop his weapon and get on the ground, Mann instead threw a thermos at the police car.That s when Officers Randy Lozoya and John Tennis came to the scene. They are the officers in the video.In the video, the officers are heard saying,  I m gonna hit him  and  Okay, go for it,  before gunning the engine and aiming for him. Mann was able to evade the police cruiser, but the officers stopped the car, got out and during a foot chase, shot Mann 14 times, killing him.Here it is: Mann was standing stationary on a sidewalk with no one in close proximity when the officers unloaded their guns,  Burris wrote in a letter he said he sent the U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch.The family wants murder charges filed.The officers  behaved like big game hunters closing in on an animal,  said John Burris, a lawyer for the family of 50-year-old Joseph Mann.Source: CBS NewsThe Sacramento police are reserving judgement, of course. Spokesman Matthew McPhail didn t say whether cars are permitted as weapons, but he did say,  our officers are encouraged to assess each circumstance and think critically about the tools at their disposal. The two cops have not been fired. They were placed on paid leave for a whole week after the shooting and now they are on desk duty.Again, Mann wasn t an innocent bystander. Methamphetamine was found in his system. The family s lawsuit claims that Mann was  displaying obvious signs of mental distress.  The police followed no protocol for dealing with a mentally distressed person and they made no attempt to deescalate the situation.The bottom line, though, is that the punishment did not fit the crime. If police can t even subdue a man who is armed with only a knife, how are they supposed to deal with a mass shooter or a terrorist? Not all crimes are equal and this certainly wasn t a crime that warranted the death penalty, not that police have that authority anyway.Featured image via video screen capture.

" Patton Oswalt OBLITERATES Trump For His Reckless PTSD Comments, And It’s Masterful (TWEET)","Speaking to a bunch of his merry morons on Monday, Donald Trump decided to say that veterans who have post-traumatic stress after war commit suicide because they just can t handle it.Trump, the drafter dodger, decided to say this about folks with PTSD: When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of folks in this room have seen many times over and you re strong and you can handle it but a lot of people can t handle it. They see horror stories, they see events you couldn t see in a movie, nobody would believe it. First of all, if Trump needs to talk about who has a mental health problem, he should just look in the mirror to see a clear narcopath. However, I m sure he s the best narcopath ever.Secondly, he needs to STFU about Veterans and PTSD. Like, right now. To say it s just because they  can t handle it  and that s why they commit suicide or have a lot of struggles isn t just woefully naive, it s absolutely insulting to our men and women who have laid their life on the line for this country.However, not letting Trump get away with being the ass that he is, Patton Oswalt took to Twitter to do what he does best, roast the a**hole.Oswalt tweeted out:Hey @realDonaldTrump: Good luck with your PTSD after Hillary stomps your dick in the dirt on Nov. 8th. #bonespurs #coward #draftdodger  Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) October 3, 2016Really couldn t have said it any better than that.

 Man Says He ‘Didn’t Mean To Offend Anyone’ With Float Featuring Trump Executing Hillary (IMAGE),"Residents in Aurora, Indiana are upset after seeing a parade float on Saturday which depicted Donald Trump flipping the switch on Hillary Clinton in an electric chair. As if that wasn t bad enough, the float also featured someone in blackface portraying President Obama as an Easter Island figure with an oversized head. The float is plastered with a Trump/Pence sign, a Make America Great Again sign and of course, something with Benghazi written on it and it also mentions Clinton s health.An Aurora mother posted a photo on Facebook of the offensive float. Who thinks this is appropriate for a fair parade where children, some of them minorities and girls, are marching and playing instruments and watching? Who thinks this is something to laugh at or be proud of?  Penny Britton wrote on her Facebook page.  This is disgusting. This makes me embarrassed to say I live here. This is Aurora, Indiana. Congratulations. That prompted different comments ranging from calling it  disgusting  and  racist,  to another saying  Who cares! On Saturday morning, the float was featured as part of the Aurora Farmers Fair Parade.WCPO reports:It s sponsored by the Aurora Lions Club, according to its website, and touted as Indiana s oldest street festival. The theme of the parade was  Celebrating the Past, Embracing the Future. A Lions Club board member spoke with WCPO and said the organization was not prepared to make a statement.The parade manager did not return a call by a WCPO reporter.Meanwhile, Frank Linkmeyer, whose trailer which held the float is now in his driveway, says he didn t mean to offend anyone and he s sorry. He did a really bad job of trying to not be offensive. We re pretty sure Trump supporters will say it s being politically correct to object because children have to witness a display of racism. One man said,  If anyone is offended by it, well don t look at it.  It s pretty hard to change the channel on a parade you re attending. The float was right there in everyone s faces.Images via screen capture.

 Sarah Palin Just Tried (And Failed) To Attack Obama And Got Ripped Apart By The Internet (SCREENSHOTS),"When will Sarah Palin learn that the best response when someone says something not-so-nice about her is to shut up?Recently, President Obama pointed out that he sees a  straight line  between the disaster that was the vice presidential nomination of the half-wit, half-term former Governor of Alaska as being the incredibly stupid straw that broke the very unfortunate camel s back when it comes to right-wing politics, the figure who helped give power to the Tea Party, the Freedom Caucus, and other far-right groups whose members very likely know how to put out a meth lab explosion and still make the baby s room look OK by the next day   all without getting soot on their robes and hoods, no less! I see a straight line from the announcement of Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential nominee to what we see today in Donald Trump, the emergence of the Freedom Caucus, the tea party, and the shift in the center of gravity for the Republican Party,  the president told New York Magazine.  Whether that changes, I think, will depend in part on the outcome of this election, but it s also going to depend on the degree of self-reflection inside the Republican Party. There have been at least a couple of other times that I ve said confidently that the fever is going to have to break, but it just seems to get worse. Sarah Palin may not be smart   but even she can see an insult from her back porch. And, of course, Mama Grizzly wasn t about to take that lying down. On Monday, she posted a scathing reply to Obama   one that surely burned his black soul (that s black as in the color, not black in the way she would point it out) to its very core. There s a reason pro-American activists have been living rent free in President Obama s head these past eight years,  Palin wrote, adding the usual rhetoric about the national debt,  destroying our children s future,  etc.  THAT S what should occupy the President s headspace, not some hockey mom from Alaska. She linked to a fluff piece from Independent Journal Review, where the truth goes to die, titled  Obama Mentioned Sarah Palin Twice In 2 Weeks. She Has An Idea On What He Should Focus On Instead. Someone should compare that to how many times she has mentioned Obama in two weeks of her mad, delusional, drunken ravings. Palin, whose son recently had to deal with a little teeny incident in which he hit his girlfriend and made threats with a gun and the undisputed champion of the Great Birthday Party Drunken Brawl of 2014, learned very quickly (oh, let s face it   she probably learned nothing) what happens when you say stupid things about the President on the internet.There's a reason pro-American activists have been living rent free in President Obama's head these past eight  https://t.co/We0lNb2Lqh  Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) October 3, 2016Twitter responded with an epic barrage of truth and mockery, most centered on her strong and unwavering support for one of the few people in history who actually may be  worse than Hitler. @SarahPalinUSA like Trump has been living tax-free for the last twenty years?  jacqui rodham (@heyjdey) October 3, 2016@SarahPalinUSA @INJO you should thank Obama for mentioning you. you're sinking, thankfully, into obscurity  Clodagh Smith (@Clodagh831) October 3, 2016@SarahPalinUSA Unfunded liabilities?

 Racist Teacher Fired For DISTURBING Viral Facebook Post About Michelle Obama (IMAGES),"How would you feel if you found out that your child was being educated by an insanely racist person? For many parents with children attending Chestatee Elementary School in Gainesville, Georgia, this became a reality.On Monday, Jane Wood Allen was fired from her job as a teacher after a shockingly racist Facebook post went viral. The post, which targeted First Lady Michelle Obama, was shared thousands of times after Roni Dean-Burren, a Houston Ph.D student, took a screenshot and shared it.The caption on the hideous post, which was accompanied by a link smearing Michelle, said: This poor Gorilla. How is she going to function in the real world, by not having all of her luxurious vacations paid for anymore? She needs to focus on getting a total make-over (especially the hair), instead of planning vacations! She is a disgrace to America! Word of Allen s posts came to the attention of school officials on September 30th, according to school district spokeswoman Jennifer Caracciolo, who said, Racism and discrimination are not tolerated in Forsyth County Schools. And it turns out, the post about Michelle Obama was far from the only bigotry that existed on Allen s page:As Allen s posts spread, the internet erupted in criticism for the racist teacher. A Facebook page was even created in her honor   it is called Chestatee Elementary School Fire Jane Wood Allen, NOW  and it was calling for her removal from the school.Dear @FCSchoolsGA.Fire Jane Allen now.

Upon firing Allen, Forsyth County Schools released a statement on Facebook that read: Effective Monday, Oct. 3, Jane Wood Allen has been relieved from duty and is no longer an employee of Forsyth County Schools. Racism and discrimination are not tolerated in our school district. We are committed to ongoing staff training on the acceptance of all individuals. As this is a personnel matter, the district will provide no further comment.

" Last Republican Reagan TRASHES GOP, Says Nancy Would Have Voted For Hillary Clinton","When you ve lost the support of the whole Reagan family, you re pretty much done for. While Republicans all across the country compete to see who can be the most like Ronald Reagan (hint   none of them can), the former president s family (including his neoconservative son) have been vehemently distancing themselves from the GOP and its presidential nominee Donald J. Trump.After a Trump supporter told Michael Reagan he wished the Gipper were still alive to see Trump ascend to the presidency, Reagan shot back with an unexpected (and surprising) revelation:My father would not support this kind of campaign,if this is what the Republican Party wants leave us Reagans out.Nancy would vote for HRC https://t.co/jkjKBvlwHa  Michael Reagan (@ReaganWorld) October 3, 2016Reagan has taken to Twitter in the last several days to utterly denounce Trump and apparently the entire GOP, hitting Reince Priebus for being a spineless hack who only cares about his career instead of the future of his party and country:If the RNC supports this I cant suppoet the RNC.Trump on Clinton:  I don t even think she s loyal to Bill  https://t.co/zTBMcB3wUi  Michael Reagan (@ReaganWorld) October 3, 2016It appears that that the only remaining Republican in the Reagan family may be on the verge of leaving the party for good. And it s all thanks to Donald Trump. Reagan told another twitter follower that Nancy was personally appalled whenever Trump (or anyone like him) dared to compare themselves to Ronald.Considering how much influence Nancy had over her husband, is it a stretch to say she very well could have convinced him to vote for Hillary Clinton (if he and she were still alive)? Most likely, yes.Imagine that: all the remaining Reagan family members becoming Democrat because their party traded its values in order to support a racist, xenophobic, sexist, corrupt billionaire that no one likes.When you ve completely lost the Reagan family, you may want to rethink your priorities.Thank you, Michael Reagan, for finally seeing the light and standing against a party that has decided to embrace the most deplorable elements if society instead of building on what you dad envisioned (even though that wasn t really good either).Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump BASHES Soldiers With PTSD And Enrages The Entire Internet (VIDEO),"Donald Trump isn t subtle. He totally clueless and unaware of the world around him. He certainly isn t sensitive and he s definitely tone-deaf about pretty much everything. Take today, when he was speaking to a group of retired veterans, many of whom suffer from PTSD, at a town hall. While talking to them about veterans  care, the terrible suicide rate among vets, and inferior mental health care within the VA system, the clueless, draft-dodging egomaniac actually insulted everyone who s ever seen combat. When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe what a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over, and you re strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can t handle it. And they see horror stories, and they see events you couldn t see in a movie   nobody would believe it. That s rich coming from someone with five draft deferments. He s got no idea at all and he doesn t want to learn. He d rather tell soldiers what he thinks PTSD is and leave it at that. So soldiers who succumb to PTSD are  weak. On the internet, people are livid and rightfully so. They ve been quick to hit back at Trump for that on Twitter because he really just hurt all the vets suffering from that awful condition, due entirely to being sent off to fight wars Trump can t even imagine, but would like to fight more of.PTSD does not mean weakness!

 BUSTED: Donald Trump Screwed Over American Steel Workers By Buying Metal From China Instead,"Donald Trump claims he will  make America great again,  but what he really means is he will continue helping China destroy America.In yet another example of how Trump has screwed over American workers in order to enrich himself and his own family, Newsweek has revealed that the Republican nominee purchased steel and other metals from China to use in the construction of his buildings instead of buying it from American companies. A Newsweek investigation has found that in at least two of Trump s last three construction projects, Trump opted to purchase his steel and aluminum from Chinese manufacturers rather than United States corporations based in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin,  Kurt Eichenwald wrote.Eichenwald painstakingly discovered that Trump built his Trump International Hotel Las Vegas by ditching American steel companies in favor of cheaper steel produced by Chinese companies who pay their workers less. The Chinese entity chosen by Trump to provide steel for the Las Vegas property is a holding company called Ossen Innovation Co. Ltd. formerly known as Ultra Glory International Ltd,  Newsweek found under  layers upon layers of corporate shells and divisions  that ultimately led to Ossen (Jiujiang) Steel Wire & Cable Co. Ltd., which operates in Shanghai. Trump was apparently trying to hide where he purchased the steel by using this strategy.For his Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, the Republican nominee acquired the vast amounts of aluminum material used from Chinese companies as well, which deprived American smelters of money that could have prevented producers in Ohio, West Virginia and Texas from closing their doors and putting Americans out of work. Newsweek estimates that  American companies lost out on more than $350 million in sales. Again, Trump tried to bury where he purchased the aluminum, but some digging revealed that the chain leads to Permasteelisa South China Factory and Permasteelisa Hong Kong Limited.Trump s actions put Americans out of work and helped foreign companies in China eliminate their American competitors. As Eichenwald explained, The losers are the American competitors like aluminum producers who cannot possibly compete with foreign companies that are willing to take losses on the sales of their building materials in hopes of driving companies in the United States out of business. And they succeeded in driving American companies out of business because greedy businessmen like Donald Trump care more about profit than they do about the American workers they hurt.Instead, Chinese companies reap the benefits. The Chinese economy is surpassing our own as the largest in the world. And Donald Trump is helping them do it without any remorse whatsoever.Eventually, as American companies are continually forced to shut down because they can t compete, these Chinese companies will likely raise their prices through the roof and create a shortage of steel here in the United States that will hurt construction companies and many others connected to them, resulting in more Americans losing their jobs. It s a vicious cycle that Donald Trump has helped perpetuate for years in the name of profit.But for some reason many conservatives still actually believe Donald Trump is going to somehow bring jobs back to America and make our economy stronger than ever, even though he is a huge part of the problem in the first place. In the end, China is not to blame for our weaker economy and jobs being outsourced to other countries. That s being made in America by selfish wealthy pricks like Donald Trump.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"October 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch John Oliver BRUTALLY Shame Trump Over His Pathetic Pretend Online Poll ‘Wins’ (VIDEO),"Since Donald Trump has to rely on make-believe to think he s actually winning in this presidential election, after the first debate he relied upon random internet polls to say that he won. Newsflash   he really, really didn t.However, that didn t stop Trump from trying to pretend that he won, so not letting him get away with it was none other that John Oliver on HBO s Last Week Tonight.Oliver went through point by point explaining that random online polls are not representative of actual polling, but rather just the opinions of whoever or whatever decided to take the poll. He then used the hilarious example of how an online poll even ended up naming a boat the ever clever name of  Boaty McBoatface. Oliver also slammed Fox News  Sean Hannity for humoring Trump and also declaring him the winner of the debate with the use of the same random internet polls. Also bringing up the fact that Fox News itself had to issue a memo that those polls aren t scientific and are not to be used as fact, stating they  do not meet our editorial standards. Who knew Fox News had standards, and how badly do you have to f*ck up to get called out for not following them?All in all, it s quite nice to see these blowhards get called out for being, well, blowhards.Watch the clip here: Featured image via video screen capture   HT HBO",News,"October 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The NRA Just Mocked Kim Kardashian After She Was Robbed At Gunpoint, And It’s HORRIFYING (TWEETS)","Kim Kardashian West just went through a hellish nightmare while in Paris, France as she visited for fashion week. She was allegedly tied up and held at gunpoint while being robbed of not only her cell phones and purse but also millions of dollars worth of jewelry. The robbers disguised themselves as police officers, so one can only imagine she was completely taken off guard.Taking no time at all to mock Kardashian after everything she s gone through was none other than the National Rifle Association (NRA). They took to Twitter and decided to go on a rampage of their own to try to make what one can only assume is some form of point.They tweeted:Wait, criminals held @KimKardashian at gunpoint in Paris? How is that possible? Does anyone know if they passed a background check first?

 Keith Olbermann: Donald Trump Wants To Protect The Right To Poison Dogs (VIDEO),"Four years ago, many complained about the fact that Mitt Romney once took a vacation with his dog strapped to the top of his car. That might not have been the ultimate demise of the Romney campaign, but for people who love animals, it demonstrated a cruel streak that many said made him unfit to be president.Donald Trump doesn t have a dog story quite like that, mainly because there s no record he s ever had a dog, or for that matter, any pet. While that isn t in and of itself that unusual, Trump has repeatedly shown that he too has a cruel streak when it comes to animals, and in particular, dogs.Keith Olbermann hilariously demonstrated that in a video,  Why is Donald Trump Such a Weirdo About Dogs? In the video, Olbermann shows several tweets and comments from Trump about people being  fired like a dog,  or  kicked out of the ABC news debate  like a dog,'  or  begging for money  like a dog.'  Mitt Romney  choked like a dog,  according to Trump. Clearly, dogs don t get fired from jobs. They don t beg for money (although it s not above them to beg for treats).For Olbermann, the most ridiculous  like a dog  comment to come from Trump was when he accused Marco Rubio of  sweating like a dog.  Anyone who knows anything at all about dogs, knows that dogs don t sweat. They do pant, though, and that can make them very thirsty, so I suppose there is a Rubio comparison to dogs, just not that one. People who don t have dogs still know about dogs,  Olbermann said.  What the hell? Is he from Mars? The far, far bigger issue, though, has nothing to do with tweets or silly rhetoric. It has everything to do with how he ll do and what he ll do as President of the United States. Trump, like pretty much all Republicans, sees regulations as obstacles to his getting even wealthier than he is.In a press release that has since been pulled off the internet, Trump complained about the  FDA Food Police,  and complained that the federal government  expects farmers to produce fruits and vegetables and even dictates the nutritional content of dog food.  (emphasis added).As Olbermann pointed out, in the last year, 11 of the 23 pet food recalls from the FDA have been because dog food manufacturers were poisoning dogs. That s when Olbermann, visibly angry, said that Trump has hinted that as a president,  he would protect a business man s right to poison dogs. Here s the video:Could you really trust a POTUS who has never had a dog? And, y know, wants to protect businesses who poison them? pic.twitter.com/NykVqnG6Nj  Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) October 3, 2016Upwards of half of all Americans own pets. Beyond that, cruelty to animals is a major indicator of other psychological problems, including psychopathy. In other words, you don t have to be a dog owner to see that Trump s attitude toward dogs sets a dangerous precedent for how he d run the country.Featured image of Donald Trump via Spencer Platt/Getty Images | Featured image of dog via Noel Vasquez/Getty Images.",News,"October 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 LEAKED AUDIO: Trump Picked Miss USA Contestants Based On DISGUSTING ‘Trump Rule’,"In new leaked audio that will make your skin crawl, Donald Trump s incredible misogyny is clearly displayed.When the Republican nominee bought the Miss USA contest he instituted a rule he calls the  Trump rule  in which he and his staff line all of the contestants up so that he can ogle them up close and only pick the most beautiful women to compete in the pageant.First, Trump lines up the women and starts dividing them based on their looks. At one point in the audio Trump remarks that women in West Virginia don t know what cellulite is, a backhanded comment meant to fat-shame women who don t meet his personal standards.He also asked contestants to choose contestants they think are pretty enough to compete for the Miss USA title, essentially allowing certain contestants to judge the others. Thus, the women were divided into groups based on which women made Trump horny.Trump went on to complain to the women about how the judges were supposedly judging the contest wrong and that the most beautiful women were left backstage instead of being picked to win.While Trump is obsessed with the women s looks, the contest has not been just about who is the prettiest. Personality is also judged.But Trump thinks only looks matter, so he and his team inspected the women and jotted down notes on a pad of paper about each one. So if a woman had a mole that Trump didn t like, it was more than likely marked down and used against her in the judging.Here s the audio via The Daily Beast:This is about as creepy as it gets, and as Raw Story points out, confirms what former Miss USA 2009 runner-up Carrie Prejean wrote in her book about Trump. Prejean described the experience of Trump looking over the girls as  humiliating. We were told to put on our opening number outfits   they were nearly as revealing as our swimsuits   and line up for him on stage,  she wrote.  Donald Trump walked out with his entourage and inspected us closer than any general ever inspected a platoon. He would stop in front of a girl, look her up and down, and say,  Hmmm.  Then he would go on and do the same thing to the next girl. He took notes in a little pad as he went along. Many of the girls found this exercise humiliating. Some of the girls were sobbing backstage after he left, devastated to have failed even before the competition really began to impress  The Donald. Donald Trump is a creep who doesn t deserve a single vote from any woman in America. As Bill Maher noted during his show on Friday, the only concrete position Trump has taken throughout his campaign is  no fat chicks.  It s a cruel and creepy policy Trump has held his entire life and he should be punished for it in November. He and the Republican Party need to learn that women come in all shapes and size and that women are sick of the bullshit way they are treated by them.Featured Image: Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images",News,"October 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Mark Cuban SLAYS Trump For Scamming The Working Class,"Donald Trump is an unpatriotic loser, says real billionaire Mark Cuban, because true patriots actually pay their damn taxes.In 1995, the Republican nominee wrote off a $915 million loss on his tax returns in order to get away with not paying any federal income taxes for the next 18 years while he continued to make hundreds of millions of dollars annually.As we all should know, taxes pay for a lot of the things that make our society great such as police, firefighters, hospitals, the military, roads, education, and many other things that are too numerous to mention. But Trump got to enjoy the benefits of the things taxes pay for without having to contribute a single penny to pay for them. The rest of us, including Hillary Clinton and Mark Cuban picked up that tab.So Cuban phoned in to CNN on Tuesday, and while he conceded that what Trump did is legal, he proceeded to blast him for failing to explain his actions. The key question, after showing a $915 million loss, is how much money does he owe still, who does he owe it to, was that debt forgiven   because if it was forgiven, that s going to eat up that net operating loss,  Cuban said.  Debt forgiveness is the same as income. He hasn t explained any of those things in any way, shape or form. That s a problem. Cuban then dinged Trump for not taking personal responsibility for his mistakes and declared that Trump is unfit to be president because of that refusal. The problem with Donald Trump and why he s unfit to be president, is that he won t own his mistakes. We all make mistakes. I ve had companies go belly-up. I say it all the time: It doesn t matter how many times you fail, you only have to be right one time and everybody will tell you how lucky you are. Just own the mistake and explain it. The problem is there s no transparency, and he won t own his mistakes, and we don t want someone like that who s ashamed of what they ve done in the business world. Being president means the buck stops at your desk, which means Trump can t blame his underlings for all the bad decisions will likely make as president. We need a president that takes responsibility, not one that makes excuses.But Cuban continued slamming Trump for referring to himself as a  smart  for not paying taxes. That s just wrong. I say it all the time: After military service, the most patriotic thing you can do as a wealthy person is pay your taxes, because that keeps the roads paved, the military paid and kids going to school. He obviously doesn t understand the concept. Here s the video via Twitter.Mark Cuban responds to a report that Donald Trump may have legally avoided paying taxes for about two decades https://t.co/mwkQ1f7nVr  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 3, 2016Cuban is absolutely right. Trump should pay his taxes like everyone else does because it would be unAmerican to not pay them. Former Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said that by paying taxes we buy civilization. By not paying taxes, Trump is freeloading off the rest of us.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Not Paying Taxes Doesn’t Make Trump ‘Smart,’ It Makes Him A Shamelessly Un-American Freeloader","Trump, not surprisingly, took the bait during the first showdown between him and Hillary Clinton at the first presidential debate. He admitted to not paying income taxes (because it makes him  smart ), and a recent bombshell report from the New York Times may confirm what we already know: he doesn t pay a time in federal income taxes because he, as a  brilliant business man,  lost almost $1 billion, allowing him to forgo paying federal income taxes for almost 20 years. However, because he refuses to release the rest of his tax returns, no one can confirm nor deny this.When you allegedly skip out on paying your federal income taxes (especially for 20 years), that doesn t make you a  smart businessman,  that makes you a shameless freeloader. When you skip out on paying your income taxes, you don t pay for:The list goes on and on. It doesn t matter what party one is from (that includes you, Al Sharpton), or how you feel about taxes, we all owe them and we all contribute to this great country called the United States. And to have a presidential candidate be smug enough to say that not contributing to these programs make him  smart  is an insult to the millions of business owners who play by the rules and pay their fair share. While even illegal immigrants pay $1.1 billion a year in personal income taxes (out of $12 billion overall), the Trump campaign and its merry band of deplorables still think he s done nothing wrong. Maybe he didn t do anything illegal, but just because something is legal doesn t make it right or ethical (we ve heard that for years from Republicans).And the last 18 years aren t the only times Trump has skipped out on paying his fair share. According to the Clinton campaign website, Trump  payed zero, or nearly zero, in federal income taxes in 1978, 1979, 1984, 1991, and 1993.  So these 5 years, plus alleged 18 years from 1995 to 2013, means there have been at least 23 years Trump paid virtually nothing. Ask the middle class and lower class how much they paid in 23 years.So don t ever tell me Trump cares about our troops, vets or military ever again. Don t ever tell me Trump cares about tackling the national debt ever again. Don t ever tell me Trump cares about Social Security or our retirees. Because if he really, truly did, he wouldn t take his irresponsible budgeting and turn it into a personal gain for himself at the expense of the American taxpayers. If he truly cared, he would have stepped up and fulfilled his obligation to the country that has given him so much. People who have less than him (and who aren t even citizens) are giving more than he is.People from both sides do this. But the man is running as President of the United States. The other person? She pays her taxes. Go on her website, there s over 15 years of full tax returns on there.I might be able to look past Trump s skipping on taxes for over 20 years if he wasn t such a sleazy businessman. If Trump was actually charitable (when there isn t legal contingencies attached to it), I might be forgiving. If he actually paid his independent contractors (which he doesn t), I might look the other way. If he didn t decimate local economies with his mishandling of money (he s done that several times), this wouldn t be as big an issue.For decades, local communities and economies have been cleaning up the messes he s made with his destructive, greedy behavior. For decades, small businesses have closed up shop, resulting in thousands of job losses, because he refused to pay them what they earned. And all the while this has been going on, we the taxpayers have been subsidizing his tax free lifestyle while he makes billions more. That right there is what s at the heart of this   it s not the fact that he used an unfair tax system to his advantage, it s that it s unethical, and it s un-American, and he puts on a facade of caring when everyone knows he d do it again in a heartbeat.There is no difference between Donald Trump and the common small town snake oil salesman, and his supporters are the townspeople   being manipulated into believing what he did (and will continue to do) is actually good for them. It s amazing that the same people who complain about  lazy minorities  and working poor not paying their taxes are all of a sudden A-OK with this guy skipping out on paying billions in taxes for 23 years.Some people can t afford to pay their taxes. Some people misfile their taxes and owe back-pay. But you want to know the difference between these people and Donald Trump? In Trump s own words, these people don t have  seven billion fucking dollars in the bank! That little zinger was said in 2011 at his Comedy Central Roast   2011, one of the years Trump wasn t paying federal income taxes, yet he had seven billion f-ing dollars in the bank. Good to know.The 2016 Republican Presidential candidate is officially the Freeloader candidate, and we re all paying for his  smart  business savvy. I hope it was worth it. And if you think Trump is going to eliminate this little loophole, knowing who his friends in business are, you ve got another thing coming to you.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",News,"October 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Made MILLIONS Renting Space To Iranian Bank That Supports Terrorism (DETAILS),"Remember, this is the same guy who has been going around calling Iran one of our greatest enemies, it turns out he seemed to have no problem aiding one of their biggest banks that also happens to be linked to terrorism.Recent reports reveal that Donald Trump was being paid half a million dollars in yearly rent between 1998 and 2003 by Bank Melli. The Iranian bank that not only aided Iran in obtaining materials for their nuclear program but also funneled $100 million to the Quds Force unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which supports acts of terrorism.Accepting rent payments from this bank may have violated the U.S. embargo that had been slapped on Iran at the time, which means Donald Trump is a serial violator of embargoes placed on enemy nations.Just last week, Trump was outed by Newsweek for violating the Cuban embargo in 1998, which is the same year he bought the General Motors Building in Manhattan and began accepting rent payments from the Iranian bank.Former State Department official Richard Nephew, who helped both President Bush and President Obama hit Iran with sanctions has a big problem with Trump renting office space to an Iranian bank that helps fund act of terrorism. It s a pretty hypocritical position to take,  he said.  It suggests that his principles are pretty flexible when it comes to him getting paid. Should someone in America have known better than to do business with Iran? Yeah. Indeed, Donald Trump has been a hardliner when it comes to Iran, but apparently that is only when it comes to the campaign trail. In reality, Trump doesn t mind working with dictators or dirty banks linked to terrorism as long as he can line his pockets.This should seriously be enough to end Trump s quest for the presidency. Clearly, he is only running to help himself. As Nephew said, Trump could easily choose money over principles when it comes to negotiating with hostile foreign nations. That s dangerous for our security and our reputation around the world. When Donald Trump says he can negotiate better deals with Russia, Iran, and China, he only means that he can negotiate better deals for himself and his own piggy bank. The last thing this country needs is a president who can be bought by our enemies.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"October 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Basketball Great LeBron James Delivers STINGING Ohio Blow To Trump,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump wants to pretend that he s for the working man, that he understands their struggles. The truth is, though, that Trump is a rich, spoiled brat who has never known poverty or what it is like to worry where his next meal or rent check was coming from. That s the reality for many average Americans, and he doesn t have a clue about it. One person who understands this is Cleveland Cavaliers basketball great LeBron James.James wrote a passionate op-ed in Business Insider, in which he laid out the reasons he is endorsing and supporting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. James writes: As a kid, I didn t have much money. It was just my mom and me, and things were rough at times. But I had basketball. That gave me a family, a community, and an education. That s more than a lot of children in Akron can say.If basketball has taught me anything, it s that no one achieves greatness alone. And it takes everyone working together to create real change.When I look at this year s presidential race, it s clear which candidate believes the same thing. Only one person running truly understands the struggles of an Akron child born into poverty. And when I think about the kinds of policies and ideas the kids in my foundation need from our government, the choice is clear.That candidate is Hillary Clinton. This is especially significant because Ohio is a state where James is pretty much worshipped, and it is also a state that is seen as essential for winning the presidency. This is an opinion that holds a lot of weight there.LeBron James embodies the American dream, as does Hillary Clinton. Hillary was raised by a mother who began working at the age of 14 because she was abandoned by her parents and had to leave the home of grandparents who never wanted her   and look at all Hillary became. LeBron James was a poor kid raised by a single mom who became one of the most revered sports stars in the country. In contrast, Donald Trump never worked for anything he has. He inherited it. He s really good at being a spoiled, entitled rich kid who has never cared about anything but himself and his brand. Do we really want that as president? I certainly don t.Thanks, LeBron. #ImWithHer, too.Featured image via David Liam Kyle/NBAE via Getty Images",News,"October 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Even Undocumented Immigrants Pay More Income Taxes Than Donald Trump,"For years Republicans have been screaming about the  takers  in our society, which to them include minorities, the middle class, and immigrants, undocumented or not.But a recent expose in the New York Times shows that their candidate for President of the United States, Donald Trump, may have used his 1995 losses (which equate to almost $1 billion) to get out of 18 years of federal income tax payments. The self described  billionaire  (who knows if that s even true), recently told the whole world that not paying taxes makes him smart. His surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie, say he s  brilliant  for avoiding his tax obligations for almost 20 years.No, morons, it doesn t make you smart, it makes you a freeloader and a con artist.But besides from the glaring truth, one group in particular actually pays more in taxes than Donald Trump, and they re the people he hates the most: undocumented immigrants.In our society, people seem to think immigrants (or  Mexicans,  as they blanket them), are coming into this country, sucking up our resources while paying absolutely nothing back to the society that they live in. Silly Republicans, that s Donald Trump you re thinking of.According to a 2016 study from Institute on Taxation & Economic Policy showed that undocumented immigrants pay upwards of $1.1 billion in personal income taxes (out of a grand total of $12 billion paid in taxes   including property, sales, other goods and services:Various studies have estimated between 50 and 75 percent of undocumented immigrants currently pay personal income taxes using either false social security (SSN) or individual tax identification (ITIN) numbers   Undocumented immigrants are currently ineligible to receive the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and state versions of the credit because they lack the legal authority to work in the U.S. Accordingly, the impact of state EITCs has been removed from the current personal income tax estimates. This has the effect of increasing the effective income tax rates paid by these undocumented taxpayers under current law.Trump, who has made demonizing hardworking immigrants a staple in his twisted, divisive and racist campaign, literally (as far as we know until he releases his tax returns) pays less than undocumented immigrants in personal income.Let that sink in.While these immigrants are paying for our troops, military, veterans, and social programs that keep millions out of poverty, Trump is skipping out   while simultaneously pretending to care about all these issues.And of course his supporters are eating it up, and they campaign is neither confirming nor denying his cheating, slimy ways.Bottom line, Donald Trump contributes less (or even nothing) to our military and future generations than the immigrants he wants to cruelly deport, and that should be enough to show the American people what a fraud and con artist he really is.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"October 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Clinton Talks Racism In Charlotte: ‘My Worries Aren’t The Same As Black Grandmothers’ (VIDEO),"Hillary Clinton visited a predominately black church in North Carolina on Sunday, where she checked her privilege at the door to discuss to discuss racism, gun violence, and police shootings.Speaking at Little Rock AME Zion Church in Charlotte, the Democratic candidate told the crowd that she was all too aware that the world her grandchildren were growing up in was a far cry from that facing America s black youth. Clinton addressed the epidemic of police shootings in the U.S., a result of what she has termed  implicit bias. The former Secretary of State lamented the deaths of 40-year-old Terence Crutcher in Tulsa and 43-year-old Keith Scott, whose killing sparked days of protests in Charlotte. I m a grandmother, and like every grandmother, I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers, who have different and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face,  Clinton said.Clinton also spoke of  10-year-old Taje Gaddy and 9-year-old Zianna Oliphant, who testified before the Charlotte City Council last week. The girls tearfully told of the impact this violence has had on their lives. At one point, Clinton invited Oliphant to join her on the stage. I wouldn t be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let s be honest here, they won t face the kind of fear that we heard from the children testifying before the city council,  Clinton said.Gun violence has been one of the main themes of Clinton s campaign and she has been supported by mothers of gun violence victims throughout her run for the presidency. Clinton has demanded better training for police officers, including education on  implicit bias.  In the days following Scott s killing, she called for Charlotte police to release the dash cam and body cam videos of his death.What Clinton s moving speech, here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: WikiLeaks’ Big Anti-Hillary October Surprise CANCELLED,"There s something about Donald Trump and his surrogates. They threaten information that s bound to doom their opponents and then, nothing.Perhaps the most obvious example was when Donald Trump insisted that he sent investigators to Hawaii to examine President Obama s birth certificate. He promised that his investigators  cannot believe what they re finding. Apparently, they couldn t believe what they found because it was literally nothing. Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and Trump s promise of a surprise never panned out.Now we have tacit Trump surrogate Julian Assange making promises of emails that will destroy Hillary Clinton. This was supposed to happen before the debate last Monday night. It didn t. Then, he promised that the emails would be released next week. They won t be. He s blaming  security. Due to security concerns at the Ecuadorian Embassy, Julian Assange s balcony announcement on Tues has been cancelled, per @wikileaks  Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) September 30, 2016The Trump campaign is probably reeling. Roger Stone, the CNN pundit, who, until just last week, was double dipping on Trump s payroll as well, tweeted this on Saturday:[email protected] is done. #Wikileaks.  Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 2, 2016Perhaps the security concerns are real or perhaps they re not. Still, as someone on Twitter pointed out, Assange has other platforms, like video. Why does he need that particular balcony to make his big, oh so damning announcement?@JesseRodriguez @wikileaks okay, I can understand the balcony announcement being cancelled but will Julian make a video/news announcement?  Susan Reaney (@SSReaney) October 2, 2016So far, Assange s leaks have been pretty weak. The most damaging was during the primaries when he released emails damning to the DNC head, Debbie Wasserman Schultz who trash talked Bernie Sanders. Yes, there were a lot of problems with this leak, and yes, Schultz did deserve to lose her job, but there was no evidence of any actual wrongdoing. It just looked bad.While the DNC leaks showed that they were likely colluding with Hillary Clinton, Assange s motives are much more suspect. It s likely that Russia is behind the hacking, which would mean that Trump is being assisted, in a scenario that would have made even Richard Nixon say  whoa,  by foreign nationals. Trump even asked Russia to hack Clinton. That may be treason.Featured image via Carl Court/Getty Images.",News,"October 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump-Supporting Alaska GOP Candidate Apparently Has No F*cking Clue Tweets Are Public (SCREENSHOTS),"Meet William Quayle Jr., who is trying to give Sarah Palin a run for the worst thing to ever come from Alaska.Quayle is a man who is voting for Donald Trump (but would have preferred Ted Cruz and previously criticized The Donald for his hateful rhetoric and lies) because he s angry about the state of our country   and running for Juneau s city assembly because things need to change, dammit (or something). And boy, does he hate that Hillary Clinton lady   largely because he buys into right-wing conspiracy theories that paint her as so sick she s likely to die any day now.Quayle s Facebook timeline is filled with right-wing memes and messages, including frequent references to convicted felon Dinesh D Souza s latest propaganda film, Hillary s America:           But his obvious stupidity   the climate change post, really?   is not what is bringing this normally unimportant person into the spotlight   it s his Twitter account, where he shares his love of large, full-figured women and their full-figured breasts and, of course, where he sends some of these women insanely creepy messages. The GOP candidate seems to spend much of his time harassing women   most commonly model Chelsea Charms   about fattening themselves up, inviting them to come live with him, and even encouraging them to get pregnant so their  boobs would get much bigger :            I do not wish to discuss about my fetishes, I am a heterosexual male and that is that,  Quayle told KTOO-FM when asked about the posts.  I do have original ideas that my competition does not have. All they want to do is tax and cut budget.  He does not deny the account is his, and even at one point auto-posted some of his more awkward messages to Facebook:It s perfectly OK for someone to like large-breasted women. It s not OK to harass women whose photos you look at while you do unspeakable things to your little soldier (it can be safely assumed that this is the case based on his public messages).The election is Tuesday. May God have mercy on our souls if this guy manages to win.Featured image via Facebook/Twitter",News,"October 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Clinton Just Expertly Trolled Trump With This Very Special Calculator,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has wasted no time using the New York Times  bombshell that was dropped on Saturday. The revelation was that Republican presidential candidate Donald trump may have manipulated his taxes to make it so that he has not had to pay income taxes for two decades. Now, Clinton is trolling Trump hard with a special tax calculator that shows exactly how much a person would pay in income taxes if they were Trump. The joke is pretty straightforward. Type in your annual income and the calculator shows the same amount of money owed in taxes is exactly $0. Clinton s campaign website also displays a message that reads: Donald Trump says it s because he s smart. The New York Times says it s because he lost almost a billion dollars. Either way, Donald Trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes for 18 years after losing $916 million in 1995. And Trump really did pay zero, or nearly zero, in federal income taxes in 1978, 1979, 1984, 1991, and 1993. Until we see evidence otherwise, we ll assume it s still zero. Clinton s campaign manager, Robby Mook just released a statement on the matter. In the statement Mook said that: He apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades while tens of millions of working families paid theirs. He calls that  smart. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, breaking decades worth of tradition. Most people on the left assumed he had something to hide. Now we have a bit more of an idea of what exactly he is hiding. Since the revelation, Trump has been lambasted by many individuals. Notably, Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, who said that Trump is a billion-dollar loser who won t release his taxes because they ll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father.  Reid also called for the passing of the Presidential Tax Transparency Act. The PTTA would make it mandatory for presidential candidates to release their tax returns if they seek the office of the presidency.Featured image from screenshot",News,"October 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Giuliani Says A Woman Can’t Be President Because Trump Is A ‘Genius’ For Not Paying Taxes,"Rudy Giuliani not only insulted the intelligence of Americans who pay their taxes every year like good citizens are supposed to do, he insulted women, too.During an appearance on ABC s This Week, the former NYC mayor responded to the bombshell New York Times report that Trump avoided paying federal income taxes for nearly two decades by calling him a  genius,  while suggesting that Hillary Clinton is a stupid woman because she paid her fair share. Absolute genius,  Giuliani told George Stephanopoulos before going on to excuse Trump s failure to contribute to the general welfare of this country. The man, in The Art of the Deal this is described, first of all we are talking about 26 years ago, perfectly legal. We should get that straight immediately. It s a perfectly legal application of the tax code and he would have been a fool not to take advantage of it. Not only that, but he would have probably breached his fiduciary duty to his investors, to his business. You have an obligation when you run a business to maximize the profits and if there is a tax law that says I can deduct this, you deduct it. If you fail to deduct it, people can sue you. Your investors can sue you. Giuliani seemed to think that Trump only wrote off a $1.8 million loss on his taxes in 1995, but Stephanopoulos had to inform him that he actually wrote off $915 million.Nevertheless, Giuliani had no problem with that either and claimed that Trump not paying his taxes is a good thing that makes him the most qualified for the presidency. But he began by bragging about how much money Trump makes now, and it turns out Trump could have paid off his losses in under a couple years but chose to let taxpayers foot the bill instead. $916 million. Well, Last year for example he made $625 million. So if he had one year in which he made $1 billion, he would have wiped it out the last [inaudible] one year. So it s unlikely that it carried forward with 18 years. That is the amount of income he was making. Second, every great man has had failures and The Art of the Deal, he explains it. Churchill was thrown out of office twice. Steve Jobs was fired from Apple and had nothing. The reality is, this man, 26 years ago, had some failures and then he built an empire. I would like that working for me for the United States. Oh, but Giuliani didn t shut up after that. He had to insult Hillary Clinton and women everywhere.According to Giuliani, Trump should be president because Hillary Clinton is a stupid woman for actually doing her civic duty by paying taxes. This a genius that had to take advantage of legal remedies that can help your company survive and grow. I want a man who is genius for figuring out how to take this country, moving in the wrong direction, where we have had a basically jobless recovery, where we ve had a growth of less than 2 percent for two years, that is pathetic. Don t you think a man who has this kind of economic genius is a lot better for the United States than a woman and the only thing she has ever produced is a lot of work for the FBI checking out her emails? Stephanopoulos would go on to hit Giuliani with Trump s past hypocrisy because the Republican nominee has whined about the conservative talking point that 50 percent of Americans don t pay income taxes and has complained about  hedge fund guys getting away with murder  by not paying taxes.Here s the video via Media Matters.Donald Trump is a complete fraud who lies to the American people. He is coward for not releasing his tax returns and now we know why he doesn t want to release them. Because they would destroy his campaign and Republicans know it.The fact is that while Hillary Clinton released her tax returns to the public and revealed that she actually pays her taxes, Donald Trump is enjoying all of the benefits of our society without contributing to the revenues that pay for them. That s unfair and un-American and he should not be rewarded for it.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Harry Reid Calls Trump ‘Rich Brat’ Who Won’t Release Tax Returns Because He’s ‘Spoiled’,"Donald Trump has one hell of a week. Starting off with his abysmal performance in last Monday s debate and ending with Saturday s New York Times  1995 tax bombshell. Trump is currently being lambasted for his manipulation of the tax system and his refusal to release his tax returns.Harry Reid has joined in with rest of the left and has arguably released the most scathing indictment of Trump on the matter of his taxes so far. Trump is a billion-dollar loser who won t release his taxes because they ll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father, Reid writes in a press release. Despite losing a billion dollars, Trump wants to reward himself with more tax breaks on inherited wealth while stiffing middle-class families who earn their paychecks with hard work. Damn, that s brutal. The U.S. Democratic Senate leader did not stop there. Reid continues, demanding that Trump release his tax returns and spells out very clearly what it means if the Republican presidential nominee continues to refuse to do so. Trump is over-leveraged and deeply indebted to someone, but until he releases his taxes we won t know who. The implications for America s security are severe. The American people deserve to know who has leverage over this man who wants to be president. In the name of the public interest, the Senate should immediately pass the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, which would force all presidential candidates to release their tax returns. If all senators agreed to pass this act for the good of the country, we could pass it in a matter of minutes. If the Presidential Tax Transparency Act were passed, Trump would be forced to release his tax returns. Let s step back and take stock: Senate Republicans have put party so far ahead of country, they ve endorsed a racist, incompetent failure who managed to lose a billion dollars in a boom year,  Reid writes.  Now they are helping Trump hide his tax returns and preventing the American people from knowing what individuals, businesses or foreign interests could have leverage over Trump. It s time we rip open Trump s closet and let the world see the financial skeletons he is hiding. The American people have trusted their officials to release their tax returns voluntarily. Trump is the first person in decades not to release his returns. He has proven that he cannot be trusted. Trump and all other future candidates  tax returns releases should be mandatory. Not only will it will be a small step forward towards a brighter more transparent democracy, it ll also make the financially corrupt think twice before running for office.Featured Image from Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Chris Wallace DUMBFOUNDED As Chris Christie Calls Trump’s Tax Bombshell ‘A Good Story’,"Last night, The New York Times ran a story that s a potential bombshell for poor, put-upon Donald Trump   he declared a $916 million loss on his taxes in 1995, which means he potentially didn t pay any income tax for the following 18 years. Today, everyone is buzzing about it on all the TV shows, and Chris Christie takes the cake for most implausible spin to make Trump look good for this.While speaking to Fox host Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, Christie called this a good story for Trump because it not only highlights all the flaws in the tax code, but it also shows Trump to be the extremely intelligent, honest, dependable, law and order candidate he claims he is.Wallace came back, absolutely stunned by that, and said: Wait, wait wait  you re saying it s a good story for Donald Trump that he failed to pay any federal income taxes   first of all, that he took a billion-dollar loss   and that he failed to pay any federal income taxes for years. That s a good story? Of course it is, Christie insists. There s nothing illegal about what Trump did. He also has a fiduciary duty to his shareholders to pay as little tax as possible, so obviously it s okay. Besides, we don t know that Trump didn t pay any income taxes for that long (although knowing him, he really didn t).Watch Wallace s sheer astonishment below:There s a reason that this isn t okay, even though it s legal, and it s because Trump not only brags incessantly about paying as little tax as possible, but he also said that doing so makes him smart. Legal and smart do not mean right, and for a presidential candidate who constantly gripes about our veterans not getting cared for, and our infrastructure crumbling, he cannot go around bragging about how he s paid little to no income tax.Especially when things like veterans  benefits and infrastructure have been crumbling because the little guy s been shouldering a lot of the tax burden in this country, while the wealthy and corporations get away with paying far less than their fair share. Trump s essentially bragging that he s gotten around, and gotten away with, something the rest of us do faithfully every year, whether we like it or not.All this actually does is show Trump for the selfish, narcissistic hypocrite he is. Chris Christie is a brown-nosed bootkisser, though, and he seems to be learning spin from the worst elements at places like Breitbart and Fox News.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"October 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump LOSES IT, Has Complete Nervous Breakdown After His Worst Week EVER (VIDEOS)","Trump has been having a very, very bad week. First, he humiliated himself in front of millions of viewers in Monday night s debate, then he reacted by fat shaming and slut shaming a former Miss Universe. Just when you thought things couldn t get worse for Trump, some of his tax returns were uncovered, showing that Trump has likely not paid a penny in federal income tax for nearly two decades.In his latest rally in Lancaster, Pennsylvania on Saturday night, he completely lost it, several times, reverting to childish antics and mockery. This is how the Washington Post recapped it:It took Trump nearly 25 minutes to read the brief statement because he kept going off on one angry tangent after another   ignoring his teleprompters and accusing Clinton of not being  loyal  to her husband, imitating her buckling at a memorial service last month, suggesting that she is  crazy  and saying she should be in prison. He urged his mostly white crowd of supporters to go to polling places in  certain areas  on Election Day to  watch  the voters there. He also repeatedly complained about having a  bum mic  at the first presidential debate and wondered if he should have done another season of  The Apprentice. First, he mocked Hillary Clinton for having pneumonia:There s nothing particularly new there, though. His favorite attack is mockery of those who dare be human, like when he mocked a disabled reporter.It gets worse, though. In another part of the speech, the thrice married, serial philanderer Trump accused Hillary Clinton of cheating on Bill.Is that my imagination, or did his crowd actually boo him?Perhaps the worst part of that rally was Trump s not so subtle dog whistle instructing his followers to go into black neighborhoods  certain areas  and monitor the polls.For a couple weeks after Trump hired campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, Trump seemed to be following his script and he appeared to be running a more disciplined message. That discipline is not only out the window, Saturday s rally proves he s far more unhinged than he s ever been. Trump is not used to losing, and to borrow a term from him, he s losing  bigly.

 WATCH: Van Jones EVISCERATES Supporter Who Thinks Trump’s Tax Evasion Is ‘Genius’,"Donald Trump has been positioning himself as an outsider who is going to clean up the corruption that is rampant in the United States government. That is, of course, absolute hogwash. It is the billionaire class that has ushered in our current era of oligarchical rule. On Sunday, CNN political analyst Van Jones informed one of Trump s surrogates that he is a billionaire who manipulates the tax code for his benefit and thus is the corruption he claims to be fighting.During Sunday s broadcast of CNN s State of the Union, the show s host Jake Tapper questioned Trump super fan Rachel Campos-Duffy on the New York Times  revelation that Trump may have used the tax code in a way to get out of paying income taxes for two decades. She dodged his question and said that President Obama is  the epitome of cronyism. Jones then called out Campos-Duffy for evading the question, saying  That s a good pivot.  That s when Jones let Campos-Duffy have it. He lambasted her and Trump for championing his tax manipulation.  It is, in fact, true if Donald Trump lost a billion dollars, think about this, lost a billion dollars, he could wind up as a winner legally in his taxes for a generation. Is that because he s a genius?  Jones asked incredulously.  It s because billionaires have armies of lobbyists to write the rules. Here s the deal: If you re obeying horrible rules that you helped to write, that doesn t make you a genius. It makes you a part of the corruption. That s exactly what every Trump supporter needs to understand. Trump is not the answer to the problems that are facing the nation. By electing Trump as president, all they are doing is taking the middle man out of the corrupt political process. Instead of electing officials who take orders from the wealthy, they would just be electing the wealthy to the office directly. The segment is one of the best that has come out of a political talk show this election season. Van Jones masterfully expresses what so many who have been fighting against Trump since he was crowned with Republican presidential nomination. What s more, Center for American Progress  CEO Neera Tanden explains exactly why it is so important for Trump to release his tax returns. If he did so, he could prove that he is as honest as he says he is. However, he won t.  He has broken from decades of tradition and only offers pathetic excuses as to why he won t release his returns. It does not appear that he will do so even now. That s because he has something to hide. The moment he does his campaign will be effectively over. If one snippet of info from his 1995 returns can be as damaging as they have so far been, one can only imagine the skeletons he is hiding.You can watch the segment below in full.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"October 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CAN’T-MISS: Bernie And Hillary MOP The FLOOR With Trump For Not Paying Taxes Like Everyone Else,"You can t say that both parties are the same when the Republican nominee avoids paying taxes for 20 years while the Democratic nominee pays her fair share.On Saturday, the New York Times revealed that Donald Trump might not have paid any income taxes for 18 years.As it turns out, Donald Trump is a terrible businessman despite his claims otherwise. And his bad decisions resulted in a $915 million loss in 1995 that let him off the hook from paying taxes for the next 18 years.Donald Trump has made millions of dollars every year since then, but has not had to pay a single dime to the federal government while the rest of us had to pay ours. He thinks that means he is a  genius. It s a bombshell that gives us a clearer idea of exactly why Trump has refused to release his taxes. Because he knows the rest of America will be pissed that a pampered billionaire who wants to control the government and our military didn t pay one cent to help pay for the services that make our country great.Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are certainly pissed off, which is why they released statements on Sunday blasting Trump for not paying taxing. There it is,  began a statement from the Clinton campaign via Twitter. This bombshell report reveals the colossal nature of Donald Trump s past business failures and just how long he may have avoided paying any federal income taxes whatsoever. In one year, Donald Trump lost nearly a billion dollars. A billion. He stiffed small businesses, laid off workers, and walked away from hardworking communities. And how did it work out for him? He apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades   while tens of millions of working families paid theirs. He calls that  smart.  Now that the gig is up, why doesn t he go ahead and release his returns to show us all how  smart  he really is? Trump  apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades while tens of millions of working families paid theirs.  pic.twitter.com/g62jB9fKr5  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2016Bernie Sanders expressed his disgust during an appearance on CNN.And then Sanders went on to blast Trump on ABC for not contributing to the general welfare of our nation. If everybody in this country was a genius like Mr. Trump is and not pay any taxes, we would not have a country,  Sanders said.Donald Trump has personally benefited from the government for decades. He even received 9/11 relief funds totaling $150,000 despite not being hurt at all by the terrorist attacks. So just to recap, this man has received government funds which were paid for by everyone who actually pays their taxes, and he did this without having to pay a single penny in taxes for nearly 20 years. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton paid over $3.5 million in income taxes last year alone. She contributed to this country like everyone else does. Trump did not, which means Republicans literally picked a bottom-feeding taker as their leader.That should make every American angry.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Alec Baldwin Nails It As Trump In SNL’s Perfect Debate Sketch,"The season premiere of NBC s Saturday Night Live! Has been a much-anticipated event. The show s election based skits have always tended to be among their best. So far this season appears to keep up with that trend. During this premiere, audiences were given a real treat   seeing Alec Baldwin do his very best impression of Donald Trump.Not only did viewers get to see Baldwin don the persona of the republican presidential nominee, they also got to see him reenact the recent presidential debate with Kate McKinnon playing Hillary Clinton.The two are excellent throughout the skit. It begins with Baldwin at the podium introducing himself as Trump to the audience, where he says: Good evening America. I m going to be so good tonight. I m going to be so calm and so presidential that all of you watching are going to cream your jeans. Considering that he is speaking in complete sentences and capable of articulating an actual thought, however bombastic, Baldwin s version of Trump is doing fairly well compared to the real life version. Speaking of amazing entrances, Mckinnon also made quite the splash when she entered the stage as Clinton. She began by ambling towards the podium while using a cane and coughing. She then abruptly drops the cane and proceeds to do a summersault. When she stands up she says,  I m better than ever, let s do this. Neither candidate was spared during the sketch. Clinton was lampooned for some of her calculated responses.  Well, Lester my opponent s tax plan benefits the top 1% so much it s not just trickle-down economics. It s, I don t know if I had to call it something off of the top of the old dome, with no prep whatsoever, I d call it Trumped up trickle-down economics,  McKinnon responds when asked how she would help grow the economy. The best part about the sketch though is definitely Baldwin s take on Trump. You cannot help but laugh every time he enunciates the word  China.  It s also a pleasure to hear Baldwin say things that almost sound as if they the writers imagined what was really going on in Trump s head during the debate. Such as when Baldwin as Trump talks about black Americans and says: The thing about the blacks is that they re killing each other. All the blacks live one street in Chicago. I went there this morning, it s called Hell street. That s exactly the type of thing I could see Trump saying during a debate, provided he didn t have the number of handlers coaching him as he does now.Saturday Night Live! Is back and I will certainly be looking forward to watching them satirize this election. You can watch the sketch below.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"October 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Trump Tax Documents Leaked And They’re STUNNINGLY Incriminating,"The chorus of voices saying,  Show us your taxes,  has been growing steadily as Trump continues to hide behind the flimsy excuse of an audit for keeping them hidden. Now, documents obtained by The New York Times may easily explain why he doesn t want the public to see them: While we all have been diligently paying our taxes each year, he very well may not have paid any income taxes at all for the last 18 years.18 years. That s astounding. That s disgusting, particularly for someone with a really fat bank account that s running for President. Trump has likely has paid so much less than his fair share that he helped to bilk the American people out of much needed services.What did the Times find? In 1995, Trump declared a $916 million loss on his taxes. That s a big enough loss to wipe out his federal income tax for the $50,000 to $100,000 he made on each and every episode of  The Apprentice,  and the $45 million he earned serving as chairman of the company that owned his failing casinos in Atlantic City from 1995 to 2009.Joel Rosenfeld, an assistant professor at New York University s Schack Institute of Real Estate, and also a tax expert, told the Times: He has a vast benefit from his destruction. Yes he does. Atlantic City and New Jersey were left picking up the pieces of his failed ventures there. But what s more damning is what Rosenfeld would say if a client came to him with a $916 million loss like Trump s: Do you realize you can create $916 million in income without paying a nickel in taxes? Wow. Yes, Trump was taking advantage of a tax system that s very heavily weighted in favor of real estate investors, and many would say that s just good business. However, just because something is legal doesn t make it right. Furthermore, when the issue of his taxes came up in the debate, and Hillary brought up his bragging that he pays as little as possible in taxes, he said: That makes me smart. Oh please. Smart? Many would say yes. However, that s anything but patriotic or presidential. It s selfish. It s shockingly selfish. It harms the veterans he claims to want to help, and the infrastructure he claims to want to fix, and everything else he claims he can turn around in his quest to enrich himself turn America into a shining golden city on a hill.And yet, this is the biggest example yet of his sheer hypocrisy. So is his campaign s statement on the matter: Mr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required. That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes.Mr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it. No, he wants to tilt it even further towards people like himself. Trump himself hasn t said anything about this on Twitter yet, but expect him to soon. Perhaps at 3 a.m., when he s writhing in fury on his bed that the Times has unmasked him yet again.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"October 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Once Tried To FORCE His Wife To Be Playboy’s Centerfold,"While Trump is busy lying about an adult film in a sorry attempt to shame former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, his own skeletons are coming out of the closet, and we don t mean about his extramarital affairs. It seems that, while he was married to his second wife, Marla Maples, he tried to force her to pose nude for Playboy, as their centerfold.He didn t even let her participate in the negotiations, really. He was on the phone to Playboy negotiating her mega fee for her. As evidenced by all three of his wives, all Trump has ever wanted his women to be are trophies, showpieces, ornaments, arm candy. Having a wife in Playboy would have been wonderful for his image as a ladykiller.Marla, though, didn t want to participate. From the original 1990 Sun-Sentinel story on the issue: Donald doesn t want Marla to look like she s against Ivana,  says Trump s P.R. guru Chuck Jones.  Donald wants picture approval. Donald says to emphasize her early years. Notably, she did resist Trump s insistence that she accept Playboy magazine s million-dollar centerfold offer.  Trump himself was on the phone negotiating the fee,  remembers a top Playboy editor.  He wanted her to do the nude layout. She didn t.  ( I m thankful for my body, but I didn t want to exploit it,  Marla offers.  How would I ever be taken seriously? ) Here s an image of the original piece:@LPDonovan Nifty find. Trump pressuring his future wife to pose for Playboy. Personally negotiated the fee. pic.twitter.com/P4AMmx10ls  Jeff Nichols (@backwards_river) October 1, 2016Trump wouldn t have wanted Marla to be taken seriously   he didn t take her seriously himself, otherwise he wouldn t have done this to her. She was a sex object, nothing more, and he wanted to parade her around as proof of his manly virility.This probably wasn t anything like the first time he did something like this, either. Trump also allegedly tried to coerce female staffers into posing for Playboy, too. How anybody could think that s okay in the context of the workplace is beyond us. He wanted a layout called,  The Girls of Trump,  and it would have featured the hottest women he had on his staff. More evidence of his manly virility.While Playboy has run similar spreads, none of the companies named in those spreads either requested or sanctioned the layouts. Trump did, but the spread never happened. He has zero right to shame Alicia Machado, even if she HAD appeared in an adult film.Featured image by Diane Freed via Getty Images",News,"October 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Germany Releases Memo Showing How Destructive A ‘President Trump’ Would Be To Our Economy,"Donald Trump s economic proposals would be disastrous for the economy. That s the conclusion that Germany s economic ministry concluded in an internal memo, first reported on by the German magazine Der Spiegel.According to the memo, if Trump were to be elected president of the United States his economic policies would lead to  a shrinking gross domestic product, fewer jobs and higher unemployment.  What s more, the memo says that Trump s economic policies violate both U.S. and international law. In a more blunt statement, the memo says that Trump s proposals are  not feasible  and that they do not  provide the foundation for a realistic economic policy. So to summarize, Germany s economics ministry has officially concluded that Trump s proposals would destroy the U.S. economy and are completely divorced from reality. That s an incredibly strong condemnation from one of the United States  strongest allies, and one of the most powerful economies in the world, and according to analysis by the Tax Policy Center, Trump s proposals would reduce income revenue by $2.6 and $5.9 trillion dollars over the next 10 years. In September, the economics research firm Oxford Economics found that if elected president, Trump s economic proposals would cause the economy to be $1 trillion dollars smaller in the year 2021 than experts are currently expecting.It isn t particularly easy for economists to create a complete prediction of what the future would look like after a Trump administration. There are many factors, such as his policies regarding immigration, that contribute to the various possible outcomes. Obviously, it s not yet clear what policies he will put into place when. That being said, it appears more and more to be a matter of finding out exactly just how bad these possible outcomes are than a matter of whether they re bad or not   a Trump presidency would unquestionably be an economic disaster for the United States.Featured image from  Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bette Midler Just Ruined Trump’s Day With A Brutal Twitter Smackdown (TWEETS),"Donald Trump has a cocaine problem. As Howard Dean pointed out, the recent  sniffling episode  at the first presidential debate is not necessarily a sign of addiction, but something funny was absolutely going on. On Saturday as Trump was having his morning   coffee? blood of the innocent? cocaine?   and stalking women who say mean things about him on Twitter, he surely was furious when he came across Bette Midler s profile.Referencing the latest of Trump s seemingly endless string of late-night Twitter meltdowns, Midler offered The Donald some advice   stop doing coke:Trump suffers a Twitter meltdown in the wee hours of AM. You gotta stop doing coke after 4PM or you'll be up all night!  Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) October 1, 2016And, of course, she couldn t resist mocking Trump s failing poll numbers, joking that Trump  says the polls are bouncing because they are fat worthless pigs    a reference to his penchant for leveling stupid insults at women who stand up to him:#Clinton is seeing a post-debate bounce in the polls.

" Trump Explodes In Rage At Debate Results, Indicates He WON’T Accept An Election Loss (DETAILS)","We all know that Donald Trump s skin is very thin. He is also a narcissist the likes of which the world has never seen on the word leadership stage. Therefore, the thought of losing the 2016 presidential election has likely not really occurred to him in any real sense. However, his disastrous debate performance, combined with a huge tilt away from his favor in the polls following a week of chaos that was completely his own doing means that a loss in November is looking more and more likely. The Donald just cannot take that, though, so he has a new solution in the event of his losing the electon: he just won t accept the result.At the debate, in which Trump seemed to run out of gas and eventually melt down completely, he still nonetheless said he would accept the results should he lose to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. However, now that it seems that a loss might be something that is looming, Trump is going back on his loss. According to the New York Times, Trump s assessment is thus:Mr. Trump, aiming to unnerve Mrs. Clinton, even indicated that he was rethinking his statement at their last debate that he would  absolutely  support her if she won in November, saying:  We re going to have to see. We re going to see what happens. We re going to have to see. So, in other words, Trump is sending a dog whistle fog horn to his most ardent, hateful, aggressive, and uneducated supporters that says just what they already believe: if he doesn t win, it was rigged. This is beyond dangerous, considering that we can never plant the seeds of doubt in the integrity of our electoral system and process. While we all know that things like Voter ID laws and false accusations of voter intimidation most definitely are aimed at disenfranchising minority voters because they largely tend to vote left, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that anything more nefarious is going on regarding election rigging.Trump s inability to accept that no one   not even him   wins all the time is downright dangerous. It cannot be stressed enough that we must trust the result of this election, and every election, no matter how unsatisfied we might be with the outcome. That means that if folks like me wake up on November 9th to headlines of President Trump, I must accept it, and if I cannot tolerate it, I must move to another country.Trump s supporters must do the same. They have shown themselves to be violent, paranoid, hateful, and ignorant, though, so it will be no surprise if they refuse to accept any outcome of the 2016 presidential election beyond the one they desire. This is simply further proof that Donald Trump s candidacy is dangerous. I shudder to think what will happen if he is actually elected president.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"October 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 UNBELIEVABLE: Florida High School Students Wear KKK Outfits To School For Homecoming (VIDEO),"Three students at a Florida high school are suspended for wearing KKK costumes to school for homecoming. The students from Wiregrass Ranch High School in Pasco County no doubt thought they were being funny or cute, or maybe they thought they were making some kind of a statement. Regardless, they upset many of their fellow students with the costumes, which they initially claimed were ghost costumes.The theme for the day was  characters,  and most students who chose to dress up dressed as superheroes or television characters. These three chose to emulate one of the most racist hate groups ever to exist in the U.S., but for what reason, nobody seems to know. A fourth student was wearing a Confederate flag, but that student took it off after being asked to, and doesn t face any disciplinary action.The outfits consisted of white sheets and pointy white hoods; very, very reminiscent of the KKK, not ghosts. They posted a photo of themselves in the costumes on social media with the caption,  BRUHHHHHHH  on it. Pasco County District Superintendent Kurt Browning said: Usually ghosts don t have pointed hoods. No, they don t. A senior at the school believes that these three had to have known what they were doing   ghost costumes look very different from KKK outfits and everyone who grew up in the U.S. knows it. We all see ghosts everywhere at Halloween, and we all see images of the KKK in our history books and media.Furthermore, with all the protests against police brutality toward the black community going on, there s a lot of racial tension. Black people are being killed in the streets by police, and white people don t want to acknowledge that the root of that problem is systemic racism, so the problem just continues. White people also insist on trying to dictate when, where and how the black community can protest, which just makes the black community angrier, and rightfully so.Because of all of that, KKK outfits, no matter the context, are especially inflammatory.Two of the students were Hispanic, and one was Arabic. None of them were black or white. There s a possibility they thought they were making some kind of a statement about the white nationalism that Trump has uncorked and normalized here.They might have specifically intended to harass black students and faculty there.They might have just thought they were being funny and cute, and they may have even thought they wouldn t get in any trouble because they aren t white.There is just no way they didn t know what they were doing, though. Browning touched on that when he went on to say: The last thing we need is to have any student regardless of race dressed up in that type of costume. The students received a two-day suspension, so hopefully they learned differently. The KKK no matter who you are is a hate symbol. Whatever the students  motives were, there is zero excuse.Watch a report on this incident below, from WFTS:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"October 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Lawyer Shot And Killed His Wife, Blames Black Lives Matter (VIDEO)","The Black Lives Matter movement has become a convenient scapegoat for many on the right, who compare the growing social justice movement that is trying to raise awareness about the problem of police violence towards blacks.The newest and possibly strangest instance of this blame game comes from Atlanta, where attorney Claud  Tex  McIver blames the shooting death of his wife Diane on the movement.McIver was riding in the back seat of his car when his .38 revolver went off, wounding his wife who was seated up front. She died in surgery several hours later.This is his explanation for what happened:McIver says he and his wife were being driven home by Diane s best friend when their Ford Explorer was approached by several individuals during a week in which there were many Black Lives Matter protests in the area, according to Bill Crane, a McIver family friend, who spoke to the The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Friday.Fearing they were about to be carjacked, McIver pulled out his gun from the center console as a precaution. McIver was falling asleep with the gun in his lap and has no recollection of pulling the trigger, Crane told the newspaper.The accusation doesn t really meet the smell test. At the very least the McIver case sounds like so many of the accidental gun deaths that come about from far too many guns floating around the country, especially in states like Georgia in the south.But it s also possible that something more sinister occurred and Black Lives Matter   a movement that has not endorsed violence and is in fact trying to curtail it   is being used as part of a blame game that we ve heard before. Violent crimes have in the past often been blamed on a convenient black figurehead in order to obscure what really happened.So far police have listed the death as a  homicide.

" Donald Trump Proves He Hates Women, Calls Reporter The C-Word (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s misogynistic behavior towards women is now legendary. Repeated stories have emerged showing the Republican presidential nominee thinks nothing of throwing out the worst phrases and ideas, particularly if the target is a woman, who Trump clearly believes are inferior to men.Reporter Jennifer Lin reveals another sordid story from Trump s fast as she was reporting on his Atlantic City casinos, which went belly-up like so many of his other bad business deals.After the article, titled  How a Curious Visitor Beat Trump at the Casino Game  ran, Trump called Lin to air his grievances. There was no hello. But there was yelling, lots of yelling,  Lin recalled.  The word  shit  was used repeatedly as a noun and adjective. Trump then called Lin s editor, Craig Stock. Craig was treated to the same Trumpian wordplay, but got an added treat,  she continued.  Trump referred to me as  that c__t. Trump denies the story, but he has also denied saying things that have been witnessed by millions of people. During the recent presidential debate he denied saying climate change was a hoax, but he did, and numerous fact checks and recorded videos show him again and again denying saying things he did.The slur also follows a pattern of behavior for Trump, recently seen in his 3 a.m. meltdown over Miss Universe Alicia Machado as he demanded that she be attacked instead of treated with compassion after he fat-shamed her.Voters have seen that Trump freaks out at reporters and news outlets that print negative stories about him, as he claims they ve made up their facts but never actually refutes them or demands a retraction. Yelling a slur at a female reporter that would dare point out his shortcomings isn t a stretch of the imagination, it s something Donald Trump does all the time.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Clinton Mocks Donald Trump With An AMAZING Tweetstorm At 3 AM,"This is hilariously perfect.Hillary Clinton has already responded to Republican nominee Donald Trump s 3am temper tantrum on Twitter but decided to double down early Saturday morning by mocking him with a 3am Twitter barrage of her very own. Except whereas Trump focused on hurling sexist insults, Hillary focused on touting public service and threw in some characteristic Trump-speak.It s 3:20am. As good a time as any to tweet about national service. https://t.co/6hRCC16UiV  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 1, 2016There are hundreds of thousands more @AmeriCorps applications than spots.

Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 1, 2016Prior to Hillary s tweets, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren absolutely humiliated Trump on her Twitter feed as well.Warren pointed out that Trump never tweets about truly important things at 3am such as helping students and workers.

" Trump’s Shady ‘Charity’ Hurt Children, And This is How","Donald Trump s controversial foundation is once again being exposed for engaging in unsavory practices. Already connected to possible tax evasion and use as a weird piggy bank for Trump and his family, now it is apparent that the Trump Foundation s funds were used to hurt children.The Daily Beast followed the money trail between the Trump Foundation and the anti-vaccination group Generation Rescue, headed by former Playboy model and actress Jenny McCarthy.Donald Trump has not only spread dangerous misinformation about the links between vaccines and autism, but he s also given money to the anti-vaxxer cause.His monetary support for the conspiracy theory came in the form of a $10,000 check to an anti-vaccine charity run by former Playboy model and television host Jenny McCarthy.Trump s monetary and moral support for McCarthy s discredited ideas have real, harmful effects they contribute to the mainstreaming of a conspiracy theory at a time when parents are increasingly deciding to opt out of vaccines despite medical advice.Vaccination is of supreme importance, especially among children who are susceptible to numerous diseases and are often exposed to them in a school environment where they must interact repeatedly with each other. Opposing vaccination and sowing doubt about them harms and kills children. The anti-science, anti-vaccination movement has led to a return of several diseases including whooping cough, which has now killed more children in the last 5 years than it has in a long time.Trump has previously gone on the record with his anti-vaccination views, pushing the idea that they are dangerous, which is absurd as his claim that climate change was a conspiracy created by the Chinese or that Ted Cruz s father was part of the operation to kill President John F. Kennedy.So in addition to the Trump Foundation being used to raise Trump s profile as a donor to charity   with him rarely actually putting any of his own money in   now it is enabling dangerous propaganda that hurts children.Featured image via Flickr/Flickr",News,"October 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Bill Maher Hilariously TORCHES Whiny Trump’s Debate Meltdown,"Bill Maher had nearly a week to plan how he wanted to lampoon loser Donald Trump s debate performance against Hillary Clinton and he did not disappoint.During his show on Friday night, the Real Time host opened the show still in disbelief that this is actually happening. But he quickly got over it and moved on to mocking Trump s sore-loser hissy fit that he has displayed ever since the debate ended. He interrupted her 51 times,  Maher said about the debate.  At one point she had to say , Mommy s talking.  He actually had a meltdown. Donald Trump had a meltdown about what a great temperament he has. It was like watching someone carve  I am not a psycho  into their arm! Maher continued by pointing out that the scientifically conducted polls show that Hillary won the debate, but Trump claims he won and has used every excuse in the book ever since to explain his poor showing. Even though all the polls showed that Hillary won the debate, oh, he won.  Maher continued.  And even if he didn t win, totally not his fault. The moderator asked the wrong questions. He had a bad microphone. The whole system is rigged. She had the questions beforehand. The sun was in my eyes. The coke wore off. Even Ryan Lochte was like  Stop with the bullshit about being robbed. You whiny little b*tch. Maher then turned to talking about the theory that Trump had used cocaine prior to the debate, pointing out that he was  manic  during the first 30 minutes before crashing and becoming very thirsty while sniffling throughout the night. Hillary got a big bump after the debate and Trump looked like he did a big bump before the debate. That s what I m hearing. I hope it s not true. A lot of people are saying it. He was stiffing a lot. It was either that or he s allergic to facts Ironically, the guy who wants to build a wall hit a wall. Maher also slammed Trump s attacks on former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, quipping that America doesn t need a president answering the 3am phone call who is already in an  enraged hissy fit. Maher then sarcastically thanked the Republican Party for this mess they created and told them they must be  so fucking proud. Your candidate finally takes a concrete position on something and it s  no fat chicks.

 Mitch McConnell Freezes GOP Donors Into Loudest Silence EVER With One Question About Trump,"It s become a weekly ritual: Trump goes through each day, doing his Trumpian thing, and at the end of the week, various media outlets are recapping  Trump s bad week.  This week, though, seems to have been especially bad for Trump, because Republicans are frightened. They re frustrated. They re confused. And they don t think he ll win the election.At a private fundraiser for Rep. Joseph Heck (R-NV), Mitch McConnell asked the room of Republican supporters whether they think Trump can win. Maybe half raised their hands. When he asked whether they think Trump will win, however, the room fell silent, and not one person was able to raise their hand.Not. One. Person. In that room. Thinks Trump will win in November.The silence in that room had to deafening. It s certainly telling. When your own party s donors don t believe you will win your election, you ve got a huge problem.For his part, McConnell refuses to talk about Trump to the press. When they caught up with him, he was curt, saying,  This is not something I am going to discuss today,  and then,  Because I choose not to,  when they pressed him on why.Even one of Trump s staunchest allies, Newt Gingrich, thinks his 3am tweetstorm about the  dishonest  press was wholly inappropriate to someone who wants to be president:.@newtgingrich said @realDonaldTrump has  got to become much more disciplined.

 Trump Campaign Accidentally CONFIRMS That Trump Illegally Put Money Into Fidel Castro’s Hands,"True to form, Trump and his campaign are royally pissed at Newsweek and Kurt Eichenwald for their report on one of Trump s companies that violated the Cuban embargo. Trump let loose a bunch of unrelated attacks, but the campaign s official response wasn t much of a response. That is, until Kellyanne Conway opened her mouth on The View.When the ladies of The View asked Conway about the Cuba story, she first said: Read the entire story. It starts out with a screaming headline, as it usually does, that he did business in Cuba. And then it turns out he decided not to invest there. But Trump Hotels & Casinos did spend $68,000 there, which violated the embargo. Conway either doesn t know what all the embargo banned, or she has no idea how to stick to her defense of her lord and savior. When the ladies of The View pressed her further, she said: I think they paid money, as I understand from the story, they paid money in 1998. And then, of course, she launched into a totally irrelevant diatribe about Hillary Clinton.But we digress.Whether it was 1998 or just before Obama lifted certain restrictions, Trump s hotel company illegally spent money in Cuba while he was chairman and still had a controlling interest. End of story.And that s concerning, as is the  law and order candidate s  denial that he ever breaks the law. In fact, Marco Rubio, who has endorsed Trump, is unhappy with Eichenwald s findings: This is something they re going to have to give a response to. I mean, it was a violation of American law, if that s how it happened,  [Rubio] said on the ESPN/ABC Capital Games podcast.  I hope the Trump campaign is going to come forward and answer some questions about this.' This wouldn t be nearly the huge deal it is if he and his campaign would say something like,  Yes, this happened, however, it was handled and Mr. Trump and his businesses took the necessary steps to ensure this kind of thing never happened again.  But Kellyanne Conway threw her boss under the bus in trying to deny this ever happened instead.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"October 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch As Trump Admits He Thought Paris Hilton Was Hot – When She Was 12 (VIDEO),"Donald Trump sure knows how to make you want to vomit. It s a skill he has mastered. This particular cringeworthy clip where he admits he thought Paris Hilton was hot at the age of 12 is one such moment.Trump appeared on the Howard Stern Show where he went on and on about how  beautiful  his daughter Ivanka s BFF was as a child and it is disturbingly creepy. Now, somebody who a lot of people don t give credit to but in actuality is really beautiful is Paris Hilton,  he said.  I ve known Paris Hilton from the time she s 12, her parents are friends of mine, and the first time I saw her she walked into the room and I said,  Who the hell is that? Did you wanna bang her?  Stern asked. Well, at 12, I wasn t interested,  Trump said,  I ve never been into that   but she was beautiful. Trump continued, saying that Paris Hilton is  dumb like a fox.  He then confessed that he had watched her sex tape. When Stern asked how he happened to come across the  leaked  video, the GOP nominee said that his wife, Melania, had shown it to him.Trump s obsession with women s looks is no secret and neither is his love of young women. Hell, this is the man who said if his daughter wasn t his own flesh and blood  perhaps he d be dating her.

 Virginia School Has Black Kid Arrested For Drinking Milk,"Seriously. This actually happened in America.Milk costs 65 cents at Graham Park Middle School in Prince William County, Virginia. But like millions of other children across the country, Ryan Turk is enrolled in the free lunch program because his family can t afford his meals.One day after going through the lunch line, Turk sat down and realized that he had forgotten to grab a milk so he went back and grabbed one like any other kid would do.Except that Ryan Turk is black, so the school security guard automatically assumed he stole it. He confronted Ryan, accused him of a crime, and demanded that he go to the principal s office. Ryan refused because he did nothing wrong.Rather than check out Ryan s story, which would have been as simple as looking at his tray and realizing that he only had one milk (which he would have known was free for Ryan if he had bothered to check if he is enrolled to get free school lunches), the security officer arrested him and charged him with disorderly conduct and petty larceny, charges that will now be on Ryan s record.The school gave Turk a choice, enroll in a diversion program by admitting to a crime he didn t commit, or face a trial in a courtroom.Again, this is all because Ryan went back for the milk he forgot as part of his lunch. It s a 65-cent milk for crying out loud, not the Mona Lisa.Rightfully so, Ryan s mother rejected the first choice.  My son is not going to admit to something he did not do,  she told the Washington Post.Turk and his mother also contend that race has something to do with the incident because Ryan has seen many other students do the exact same thing he did without being confronted by school security.The school has dismissed the accusation that racism had anything to do with the situation because the security guard and the principal are both black. But Turk s attorney Emmett Robinson begs to differ. It s not the players, it s not the people who discriminate; it s the whole system,  Robinson said,  The system is set up now so that school resource officers get to determine the impact on a person s life. Indeed, treating black kids like criminals has ended up creating a vicious cycle that has resulted in the disproportionate imprisonment of blacks in this country.There is little doubt that if Ryan had been white he would have never been approached by the security officer.The fact is that Ryan Turk was entitled to have a milk with his lunch, which is FREE. He just forgot it and merely did what he has seen other students do. Security did not have a problem with those other kids going back for their forgotten milk. So why did the security officer treat Ryan differently? Race must have played a role. And even if it didn t, having a child arrested over a 65-cent carton of milk is absolutely ridiculous. It s a waste of resources and a waste of the court s time.Surely, the school and the judiciary must have more important things to deal with.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"September 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The GOP Just Revealed What They REALLY Think About ‘National Security’,"Congressional Republicans plan on dogging Hillary and the FBI about her emails and use of a private server from now until kingdom come. It s a matter of mishandling classified info, they say. She potentially put our national security at grave risk, they claim. We have to investigate every last letter of every last word of every last sentence here, they insist. But when it comes to investigating a true threat to national security, they re blocking attempts at every turn.Of course, we re talking about Donald Trump s potential ties to Russia. Congressional Democrats keep running into roadblock after roadblock in trying to open an investigation into that. GOP staffers told The Daily Beast that while it seems their bosses are privately concerned about the issue, they would rather continue harping on Hillary.It s politics. Disgusting politics that really does put us at risk. The problem is likely that Trump is their nominee which really should make it all the more concerning. Given the GOP s apparent need to protect our security (they re angry with Obama for not going after ISIS the way they want in addition to insisting that Hillary jeopardized our security with her email server), one would think they d be all over this.Intelligence briefings given to both the Senate and House Intelligence Committees point to Russia using hacking as a means to influence our elections: Communications and documents stolen in those hacks have been selectively leaked online since, by a hacker claiming to be unaffiliated with the Russians going by  Guccifer 2.0.  But analysis by private-sector cybersecurity firms have concluded that the character is most likely a front for the Russians to cast doubt on their culpability.Two other hacks   both of state election boards   have also been loosely tied to potential Russian hackers. In Illinois, thousands of voter role records were accessed, and Arizona was also targeted. Though nothing was done to influence elections in those states, experts believe Russian hacking is designed to cast doubt in the security and validity of the election. It s true that some Republicans are suffering some measure of  buyer s remorse  over the party s nomination of Trump, but in blocking investigations that are this important, all they ve done is unmask themselves as the impostors they are. To some, this is black-and-white. Kurt Eichenwald of Newsweek went on Twitter to call them out for this blatant hypocrisy:GOP Congress spends a year and a half investigating Clinton emails, but refuses to investigate whether Russia is hacking our election? WTF?  Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) September 30, 2016And he s got it. Republicans have attacked Hillary on everything under the sun because they hate her, and they fear her, and they don t want her to be president. It s not about national security with her. They won t go after Trump for something far more dangerous and frightening because they re protecting their own. It s Republican politics at its finest.Featured image via Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images",News,"September 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Fox News Poll Shows Who Their Viewers Think Won The Debate, And It’s Pretty Damn Hilarious (IMAGE)","If there s one news organization that Donald Trump can usually always rely upon to be in his corner, it s Fox News. The media branch of the Republican party will pretty much always show bias towards any Republican candidate or conservative ideal. Most of the time even without trying to find any facts of any kind.However, it looks as though Trump is going to hate the new poll that Fox News revealed showing who, according to them and their viewers, won the first presidential debate.Winning with 61% of viewers polled was none other than Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.In fact, Trump was only able to garner 21% of those polled to say that he won, with 12% saying it was a tie.New Fox Poll: Who won first debate? #SpecialReport https://t.co/lmsmO06yfj pic.twitter.com/coMvS84lCj  Fox News (@FoxNews) September 30, 2016If you re any good at math, that s not even close. Not even remotely close. Hillary got well more than half of those polled saying that she definitively won, while Trump probably held onto the few who were going to say that he won no matter what.The bar is set so incredibly low for Trump, too. If he kept his pants on, those 21% pulling for Trump were still going to say that he won. So, for Hillary to sweep up this debate as a win in her column with even Fox News viewers, well, that s bad news for Trump and his floundering campaign.It will be interesting to see how he behaves in the next debate to try to sway viewers.Featured Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images, Twitter",News,"September 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CREEPY: Trump Promised Teenage Ivanka He’d Never Date Anyone Younger Than She Is (AUDIO),"Donald Trump s relationship with his daughter Ivanka has definitely raised a few eyebrows. It s bad enough that all of his wives   including his current wife, Melania   have been a couple of decades younger than he is. What is more disturbing is the fact that he seems to have the hots for his daughter. Well, this troubling notion is even more eyebrow-raising when you consider an interview Trump did with radio host Howard Stern in 1999.Apparently, Trump and Stern were discussing the women they like to date, and Trump mentioned that he had promised his daughter Ivanka, who was seventeen at the time, that he would not date anyone younger than she was. Even crazier is the fact that the age of consent in the state of New York is seventeen years of age, so, essentially, all Trump, who was 53 at the time, was promising to do is not to commit rape. One could argue all day long regarding statutory rape laws and their fairness,  but no 17-year-old girl is going to want to do anything like that with a 53-year-old man unless she was shamed, guilted, bullied, or forced into it. End of story.Trump said to Stern: I have a deal with her. She s 17 and doing great   Ivanka. She made me promise, swear to her that I would never date a girl younger than her. So as she grows older, the field is getting very limited. Stern, who sounded taken aback, made an awkward joke in response: The nerve of her. Now you can t go out with 16-year-olds. Indeed. Needless to say, these comments simply continue the narrative that Trump has an unhealthy affinity for girls that are far too young for him, and this conversation seems to suggest that if he could get away with it, he d date and have sex with underage girls. Is this the sort of man we really want in the White House?Listen to the audio below, via the New York Daily News:[ad3media campaign= 977 ]Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News,"September 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 WATCH: Joe Biden Gives DEVASTATING Critique Of Trump’s Debate Performance,"On Thursday night, Vice President Joe Biden joined host Jimmy Fallon on the Tonight Show for the very first time, and he did not disappoint.Biden was his usual charming self, and he continued to captivate the audience throughout the interview, even as he took on a more serious tone when Fallon asked him if he watched the debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on Monday night. Biden admitted that he had watched, and was baffled that Trump had even been able to make it as far as the debate stage.Fallon also asked Biden about the constant fact-checking that was required whenever Trump opened his mouth, and Biden made the audience erupt in laughter as he said: I ve never quite seen anything like that. I ve never seen anybody who knew as few facts. Biden then brought up his own debate against Sarah Palin, which had taken place eight years ago, before going right back to critiquing Trump s pathetic debate performance and character. In particular, Biden called out the shocking moment that Trump said he was  smart  for not paying his federal income taxes like the rest of Americans, and advised that it was nothing to brag about.Biden, much like his boss President Barack Obama, is widely loved and respected by the American people, so his criticism is especially damaging to Trump. Americans should take note when Biden says Trump has caused a lot of worry and tension for America s allies, and is putting the reputation of our country in jeopardy. Biden said: I ve never known of a candidate who knows as little about the world as this man does. I don t even think he understands how much damage he does by what he already said. Biden s right   Trump is absolutely clueless and it couldn t have been more obvious after he had to go up against Clinton on Monday.

 The Star Trek Franchise Mobilizes Against Donald Trump For A Brighter Future,"Star Trek opposes Donald Trump for obvious reasons.In a lot of ways, Star Trek has predicted the future of Earth and humankind. Technologically, Star Trek has inspired many of the inventions we take for granted today such as cell phones, tablets, and laptop computers. Currently, scientists are working on developing transporters, tractor beams, and other tech found in the Trek universe.But the vision of Star Trek is a Utopian future where war, disease, hate, hunger, and sexism no longer exist and the only thing people work for is to better themselves because money is unnecessary. The nations of Earth are united and so we set out into the wider universe in search of new life and new civilizations to join us.But Donald Trump has no interest in creating a better future designed to help and unite all humans. If elected to the presidency, Trump will slam the brakes on progress and take us back to an era before Star Trek was even an idea. And that is so scary that the casts and crews across the various Star Trek series are uniting against Trump and urging people to vote for Hillary Clinton if we want to continue the path toward a brighter and more hopeful future. Star Trek has always offered a positive vision of the future, a vision of hope and optimism, and most importantly, a vision of inclusion, where people of all races are accorded equal respect and dignity, where individual beliefs and lifestyles are respected so long as they pose no threat to others,  the group Trek Against Trump wrote on Facebook.We cannot turn our backs on what is happening in the upcoming election. Never has there been a presidential candidate who stands in such complete opposition to the ideals of the Star Trek universe as Donald Trump. His election would take this country backward, perhaps disastrously. We need to elect a president who will move this country forward into the kind of future we all dream of: where personal differences are understood and accepted, where science overrules superstition, where people work together instead of against each other.The resolution of conflicts on Star Trek was never easy. Don t remain aloof  vote! We have heard people say they will vote Green or Libertarian or not at all because the two major candidates are equally flawed. That is both illogical and inaccurate. Either Secretary Clinton or Mr. Trump will occupy the White House. One is an amateur with a contemptuous ignorance of national laws and international realities, while the other has devoted her life to public service, and has deep and valuable experience with the proven ability to work with Congress to pass desperately needed legislation. If, as some say, the government is broken, a protest vote will not fix it. Do this not merely for yourself but for all the generations that follow,  the post concludes.  Vote for a future of enlightenment and inclusion, a future that will someday lead us to the stars. Those who signed the statement include George Takei, Walter Koenig, and the families of Leonard Nimoy and Jimmy Doohan of the original series, Jonathan Frakes, Wil Wheaton, and Brent Spiner of The Next Generation, Kate Mulgrew, Robert Picardo, and Tim Russ of Voyager, Scott Bakula, Dominic Keating and Connor Trinneer of Enterprise, Ren  Auberjonois and Armin Shimmerman of Deep Space Nine, and Chris Pine Zachary Quinto, and Zoe Saldana from the new Star Trek film series. Along with many other Trek actors, the signatories also include writers, directors, and the son of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry.Here s the full post via Facebook:Star Trek is the idea of the future we all want to believe can be reality one day.

 Here’s How The Trump Campaign Can Still Win And Why They Probably Won’t,"Dubbed the  missing white voters,  Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight wrote an in depth analysis of what Donald Trump needs to do in order to win: Register between 5 to 47 million white voters starting now until election day.Here s a scary stat for Democrats: In 2012, President Obama won re-election by almost 5 million votes, but about 47 million eligible white voters without a college degree   including 24 million men   didn t bother to vote. In 2016, these nonvoters are part of the demographic that is most strongly in favor of Donald Trump.If Trump rouses even a fraction of these notoriously disaffected Americans   like this grease-smudged, 61-year-old first-time voter in western Pennsylvania   he could surge to victory. There s just one catch: If we re on the cusp of a blue-collar Great Awakening, it s not yet showing up in the registration data.In other words, Trump has all this support from this major demographic that could deliver him to a landslide victory   but they aren t registered. These  missing  white voters are literally the key to Donald Trump s success, and they hold the key to the swing state vote:If Trump were able to activate merely one of every eight of these  missing whites  to vote for him, he would wipe out Obama s 2012 margins in three states   Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania   and win both the Electoral College and the popular vote. If he were able to activate one of every five, he could add Virginia, Nevada, Iowa and New Hampshire.So, in order to merely  catch up  to President Obama, Trump needs to register at least 5 million more people. Considering registration among nonwhite voters (who overwhelmingly favor Hillary Clinton) is up in battleground states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina (compared to white registrants), and Clinton is gaining with white women, Trump has even more to go.If Trump hopes to overtake Obama s numbers in the crucial swing states, he better hurry up.The voting registration deadlines in Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio are on October 11, less than two weeks away. In less than three weeks, Virginia and Nevada will reach their deadlines, October 18.Here are the dates of individual state deadlines.In other words, the Trump campaign has 18 days to register at least 5 million white voters in 5 swing states, which translates to 277,777 voters a day.Considering his horrendous excuse for a ground game, that won t be an easy feat.As of right now, Democrats have the upper hand in Pennsylvania and Virginia, where metropolitan, non-white registrants are trouncing rural whites.FiveThirtyEight finds that Trump s shoddy ground game, mixed with laziness enabled by the RNC, hurt his chances greatly:So what s going on? It could be that Trump is motivating slightly more new voters against him than for him. Or, perhaps more likely, it could be that white working class voters are out there to be activated, but Trump s campaign and the Republican National Committee have waited until too late to build the analytics and ground infrastructure necessary to identify and register them. That s where Clinton and the Democrats have excelled.So with less than three weeks to go until more than half the states end the registration process, the Trump campaign has already hit a wall (no pun intended). Democrats shouldn t get too excited. The chances that a massive voter turnout on election day could propel Trump to the presidency is a possibility. Democrats need to keep up their registration efforts, and launch a Get Out the Vote movement of equal or better proportions.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Phoenix Police Department Just Sent Trump A Cease-And-Desist Letter — They’re Furious (VIDEO),"The Phoenix, Arizona police department is not at all happy with Donald Trump after the GOP presidential nominee aired an ad implying they were endorsing him.

 The Alicia Machado ‘Sex Tape’ Trump Just Tried To Shame Hillary Over Doesn’t Even Exist,"Just hours after Trump told millions of voters to watch Alicia Machado s sex tape, it turns out no such tape exists, and the woman in the said  tape  is a pornographic actress who has a resemblance to the former Miss Universe contestant.That s quite a candidate you got there, Republicans.In a bizarre early morning Twitter tirade, the Republican nominee for president slammed  disgusting  Alicia Machado, accusing the Clinton camp of expediting her immigration process so she could help her in a debate:Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Shortly after Clinton brought up Muchado in the first presidential debate, websites (with no credibility) began circulating a claim that Muchado was a pornographic actress:Former Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who has been campaigning against Republican nominee Donald Trump for the Hillary Clinton campaign, has appeared in pornographic videos.Snippets of an adult film starring Machado are available on multiple free porn websites. Machado also appeared topless in Mexican Playboy in 2006 and 2012. Hillary Clinton invoked the 1996 Miss Universe winner in an attack on Trump during Monday s debate.While it is true Machado posed nude for Playboy magazine, the notion that Machado is a pornographic actress or has a sex tape (that can be viewed by the public) is a completely bogus rumor that has been circulating the internet for years. The only thing that could even come close to a  sex tape  is low quality footage from a Spanish reality television program La Granja, in which Machado was kicked off for reportedly having sexual relations with a cast member. The act was caught on a grainy night vision camera from the studio that run 24/7.And Trump was stupid enough to believe internet rumors   kind of like how he believes the National Enquirer.According to Snopes, which looked into the claim:In 2009, a video clip purportedly showing the former Miss Universe winner engaging in anal sex was circulated online, and that is the clip that now most frequently shows up in response to web searches on the phrase  Alicia Machado porn..  However, the woman seen in that video is not Alicia Machado   the clip was taken from the 2004 DVD Apprentass 4, which features porn actress Angel Dark, and was later retitled to suggest it showed Alicia Machado.Good job, Trump! You just asked 320 million Americans to watch Angel Dark have sex in a movie that bears a resemblance to your TV show s name.I can t wait to see how Republicans defend this one.Remember when a presidential candidate attempted to slut-shame someone, and told people to watch a  sex tape  (which doesn t exist) because he got his feelings hurt after being called out?Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

" USA Today BREAKS Neutrality, Begs Readers Not To Vote For Trump","In an unusual and shocking move, the editorial board of USA Today did something no one say coming: for the first time in their 34-year history, they broke their rule of neutrality, and blasted Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Never before taking any side   let alone taking a position of any sort   the board labeled Trump a danger to America, writing that his  erratic,   ill-equipped  personality (as well as his  checkered  business past) disqualify him from the presidency.Writing not in support of Clinton but rather in sheer resentment of Trump, the board blasted the nominee for his unconventional and downright  prejudiced  ways:This year, the choice isn t between two capable major party nominees who happen to have significant ideological differences. This year, one of the candidates   Republican nominee Donald Trump   is, by unanimous consensus of the Editorial Board, unfit for the presidency   He has demonstrated repeatedly that he lacks the temperament, knowledge, steadiness and honesty that America needs from its presidents.The board called on voters   much like Ted Cruz did at the RNC   to vote their conscience and follow their convictions, asking them to  resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue,  and  by all means vote, just not for Donald Trump. One of the biggest reasons for the plea of deflection is due in part to Trump s misguided and dangerous view of the world, from his blunders on NATO to his high regard for Vladimir Putin.Trump s foreign policy pronouncements typically range from uninformed to incoherent. It s not just Democrats who say this. Scores of Republican national security leaders have signed an extraordinary open letter calling Trump s foreign policy vision  wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle.  In a Wall Street Journal column this month, Robert Gates, the highly respected former Defense secretary who served presidents of both parties over a half-century, described Trump as  beyond repair. The stinging rebuke comes just days after Vice Presidential candidate Mike Pence penned an op-ed in the newspaper outlining why voters should choose Trump and himself.Talk about great timing.USA Today s half endorsement, half non-endorsement follows a slew of newspaper who are famously bucking Donald Trump (and instead endorsing Clinton). USA Today s editorial board expressed deep concerns for Hillary Clinton, citing her emails, her candor, and issues with her entitlement.Nonetheless, the board sent a strong message in an age of neutrality: the stakes could not be higher, and we as a nation cannot take a risk with Donald Trump in the White House.Much like the onslaught received by the Arizona Republic, USA Today is sure to feel the wrath of Trump supporters in the coming days. However, a poll on the paper s website asks readers if they agree with the board s decision or not. Out of almost nine thousand votes (so far), 85 percent agree.That s a good start.Good for the USA Today editorial board   they have a backbone, and it s about time those in the media stand up to the racist, fear mongering bully that is Donald J. Trump.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"September 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BOMBSHELL: The Trump Foundation Cannot Legally Raise Money,"Trump loves to brag about his foundation while simultaneously ripping the Clinton foundation, because he s Donald Trump and Donald Trump has the best of everything. Except the Trump Foundation never went and got the certification the State of New York requires for non-profit organizations to solicit money from donors. That could actually shut the foundation down.Any charity that s based in New York, and solicits more than $25,000 per year, must get special registration, and must also submit to strict and severe annual audits. These audits that ask whether the organization spent any money on behalf of its officers, which is something Trump does with abandon.Trump is already in trouble for using funds from the foundation to pay off more than $250,000 in personal lawsuits. He also used foundation money to advertise his hotels, and to buy portraits of himself. This is known as  self-dealing,  and it is illegal. But legalities are just details to Trump. They don t matter as long as he gets what he wants.The Trump Foundation is also in trouble with the IRS, which fined the Trump Foundation $2,500 for donating to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi s re-election campaign at the same time she was considering investigating the scam known as Trump University. Whatever he says, he was trying to buy her off and we all know it.In other words, the foundation is in water that s so hot it ll reach its boiling point soon. Then what happens? If New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman finds that the Trump Foundation illegally raised money, he can order them to stop doing so immediately.Schneiderman could also get a court to order the foundation to return the money it s raised. That could potentially bankrupt it.Trump s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said recently that the foundation s money is Trump s while she was trying to blow up Trump s amazing generosity. When she was corrected, she said that the foundation s money comes from Trump. It doesn t. Trump hasn t donated much to his own foundation since 2008. The vast majority of the money   far more than $25,000 per year comes from outside donors.And it s illegal. Trump s sins are coming back to bite him just in time for November.Featured image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"September 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Will HATE This Mexican Magazine For Unmasking Him On Their Cover (IMAGE),"Mexico does not like Donald Trump, and for good reason. He s accused their people of being rapists and killers, said that the country is deliberately sending their trash up to us to deal with, and we all know about the wall he wants to force Mexico to pay for. One Mexican literary magazine, called Letras Libres, decided to illustrate what they think of Trump after all of this. Their October issue features him on the cover, and it s not in a flattering light:En nuestro n mero de octubre: pic.twitter.com/xhMFnU9ttR  Letras Libres (@Letras_Libres) September 28, 2016That  stache is reminiscent of Hitler s mustache and reads  fascista Americana,  or,  American fascist. Suffice it to say, the editors at Letras Libres aren t thrilled with Trump, either.One expert on the history of fascism said that Trump s nonstop, offensive ethnic stereotyping, and his fear-the-foreigners rhetoric are textbook fascism. Mexico is a foreign country. Their people are foreigners, and Trump likes to claim they re stealing our jobs, both inside and outside our borders. He hates them and he wants us to hate them.His ability to convince his loyal subjects that the country is in serious decline, when it isn t, is likewise textbook fascism. He s got the entire world worried, confused as to how he could even have gotten this far in a U.S. election cycle, and just generally pissed the hell off.One thing he did recently was complain that Mexico forces us to pay a tax to sell products there, but they can sell their products here without paying the same tax. Mexico has a value-added tax that American companies must pay when they sell products there, but Mexican companies have to pay that same tax to sell in their own country, even though they don t have to pay it here. Our companies don t pay it here either.Trump listed that as one of his millions of reasons that NAFTA is needs to be torn up. Trump doesn t know what he s talking about. But that is, in fact, just another claim that Mexico is stealing from us, and must be stopped.In other words, Letras Libres sees Trump for what he is. He may not quite be Hitler or Mussolini (yet, mostly because he s not in charge yet), but he s definitely got a very strong fascist streak.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Goes DISGUSTINGLY Low With Assault On Hillary’s Family (VIDEO),"During the first presidential debate, Donald Trump threatened to attack Hillary Clinton with her husband s extramarital affairs. He has spent every day since bragging about how much credit he deserves for not pulling out Bill s infidelities as a weapon against his opponent.In an interview on Thursday, Trump said he  would have had the right  to take aim at the former president and his scandals for two reasons. First of all, said the GOP nominee, Hillary is a big meanie who has said  horrible and false things  about him. Second, Bill is fair game because he has been campaigning on his wife s behalf.Trump also tried to claim that the reason he chose to take such a high road is because Chelsea Clinton was sitting in the front row at the debate and he is such a classy, upstanding guy that he just couldn t bring himself to say those awful things in front of such a sweet young lady.When the reporter asked him why Bill s scandals reflected poorly on Hillary, since she wasn t the one who had actually done anything wrong, Trump s response was as disgusting as every other vile, misogynistic thing that comes out of his mouth. Well, you ll have to figure that out. I think it s pretty simple to figure that out,  Trump replied.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Megyn Kelly SILENCES Trump’s Campaign Manager As She Pathetically Attempts To Defend Sexism (VIDEO),"While Megyn Kelly is a Fox News anchor, and she definitely toes the GOP line on most things, it s hard to deny that, when it comes to women and women s issues, Kelly is pretty spot-on about things. This never shines more than when she s talking about Donald Trump s misogyny. Trump s campaign manager is a woman, but when Kelly put the screws to her over that very issue, she can t even really formulate an answer.Kellyanne Conway, who regularly appears on Fox News to speak for Trump, appeared to try her best to downplay the blatantly sexist pig that is the Republican presidential candidate. She said that he d just made a couple of comments over the last 25 years, as if saying that women need to be treated like shit, that leaving his own wife on the tarmac for being five minutes late, and bashing Kelly herself over her questions about his sexism, is really just nothing.Kelly hit her back with: You know that s not true. You know. know he has repeatedly made comments about women, about their looks, about their size, their weight. Even in this campaign, talking about [former GOP presidential candidate] Carly Fiorina s face, retweeting a negative picture about Heidi Cruz s face, criticizing Hillary Clinton and her  look.  And, Kellyanne, this is an issue for him, is it not? All Conway could do in response was criticize Hillary s campaign and debate topics. Watch her never figure out how to answer Megyn Kelly s questions below:[ad3media campaign= 973 ]If all Kellyanne Conway can do is parrot Trump, she actually doesn t make a very good campaign manager because she flounders with questions she should be able to answer.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"September 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" BREAKING: Lawsuit Shows Trump Wanted To Fire, Replace ‘Unattractive’ Female Employees","While Donald Trump and Kellyanne Conway continue to boast about how uplifting and fair the billionaire mogul has been to his female employees (hiring, promotions, large salaries), court documents obtained from the Los Angeles Times paint a more sinister, misogynistic view into how Trump really felt about female employees.In other words, it highlights exactly the kind of person Trump is and just how he treats women.According to the court documents, Hayley Strozier, director of catering at the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, accused Trump of asking managers to fire  unattractive  waitresses and replacing them with  attractive  ones instead:I had witnessed Donald Trump tell managers many times while he was visiting the club that restaurant hostesses were  not pretty enough  and that they should be fired and replaced with more attractive women.Other court documents from 2012 document that Trump had asked Sue Kwiatkowski that his premises in Los Angeles should showcase only  attractive  women:Donald Trump always wanted good looking women working at the club. I know this because one time he took me aside and said,  I want you to get some good looking hostesses here. People like to see good looking people when they come in.  I and the other managers always tried to have our most attractive hostesses working when Mr. Trump was in town and going to be on the premises.In Donald Trump s America, a woman is not judged on her merit and ability to get the job done, but by her looks   and if she doesn t have the looks, she s out of a job. Because of Trump s ridiculous and sexist demands, managers were often forced to hire inexperienced, inept employees due to looks over the experienced, capable employees who didn t fit the mold of  attractive  enough.The outrage lies within one caveat: he only did this with female employees, not males. Either Trump thinks all men are drop-dead gorgeous or he really does have a blatant disregard for treating women with respect.And it s not like the ill deeds towards these women did not go unpunished. As part of a  broader labor relations lawsuit  (which includes other complaints than sexist mistreatment), Trump had to compensate:The bulk of the lawsuit was settled in 2013, when golf course management, without admitting any wrongdoing, agreed to pay $475,000 to employees who had complained about break policies. An employee s claim that she was fired after complaining about the company s treatment of women was settled separately; its terms remain confidential.If Trump really treated women with respect, why did he have to give hush money to a female employee who complained about ill-treatment of not just her, but women overall?Maybe someone should tell Kellyanne Conway before the next time she starts babbling on about how great he is.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Wells Fargo CEO Gets Completely HUMILIATED In Must-Watch Hearing (VIDEO),"In the age of oligarchy and near pandemic outbreaks of affluenza, it is truly refreshing to see a member of the rich and powerful class be held accountable for their crimes against humanity. On Thursday, a House of Representatives hearing with Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf provided the world with one of those rare and beautiful moments when a member of the bankster class was beaten into submission by our elected officials.During the hearing, which could be described a more of a verbal execution, Stumf was lambasted from all sides by those from the panel that he was brought before. Lawmakers such as  Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a Republican, chastised Stumpf for proving progressive Democrats correct in their goal to see stronger regulations be put in place within the banking industry.  To sit here and have to watch you essentially validate everything that the other side has said about you and your business and your industry, I don t know, for the last three or four generations, is extraordinarily disappointing to me,  Mulvaney said.  The damage that you have done to the market, to your industry, far exceed the damage that you ve done to your own business. Sean Duffy, another congressional Republican (even though he is a member of the GOP, he is an ally with Sen. Elizabeth Warren when it comes to certain financial industry reforms) perhaps provided one of the best moments in the hearing, where he forced Stumf to admit that his company had stolen from the American people. Stumpf tried to describe what Wells Fargo did in every single way he possibly could without using the word  steal.  That is, of course until Duffy laid into him. Was it theft?  Duffy asked. Pardon me?  Stumph responded. Was it theft? Did you steal?  Duffy pressed. Our people did not do what was right,  Stumpf said evading the word. My question is, did you steal? I want to make sure you and I are on the same page. Did Wells Fargo employees steal from a million to two million customers? Yes or no?   In some cases. They did. Yes,  Stumph finally admitted.Here s a clip:[ad3media campaign= 974 ]Don t think for a moment that Republicans were the only ones to hammer the CEO. Massachusetts Democratic Representative Mike Capuano offered the coldest words of the panel members to Stumph.  You think today is tough? When the prosecutors get a hold of you, you re going to have a lot of fun,  Capuano said.If the 2016 election has proven one thing, it s that the people of the United States are out for blood. This new wave of populism has manifested itself in horrifying ways on the right-wing, mostly in the form of Donald Trump s ascension as the GOP s presidential nominee. That being said, Congress needs to take a cue from the people and begin to work together to right the wrongs of banking and financial deregulation. Center Republicans and Democrats must join together with progressive lawmakers today. The bipartisanship witnessed within Thursday s hearing can be the start of a new movement within Congress. After all, as Mulvaney half-heartedly conceded   the actions of Wells Fargo have proven that progressives have been correct in their calls for new regulations in the banking industry for decades. Yesterday, I would have believed a unicorn sighting is more plausible than to hear those words.

" The Ladies Of ‘The View’ Just STEAMROLLED Trump’s Campaign Manager, And It’s GLORIOUS (VIDEO)","It s not clear whether Donald Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway thought she could go on The View and think she could get away with lying, but that definitely seemed to be what happened Thursday morning.While Trump still hasn t had the courage to appear on the morning talk show himself, Conway took the plunge and surrounded herself with five very opinionated ladies who haven t ever been known to hold back.Conway tried to sell the same tired lines she s been selling to cable news outlets all over the place, but the ladies weren t having it. Not. One. Bit.At one point, Whoopi Goldberg asked point blank: Where are his damn tax returns?! And when Conway tried to pathetically pivot, Goldberg didn t let up, saying: What is Donald Trump hiding by not releasing that information?  I want to know since every other president has had to do it, where are the tax returns? Then after more lies about Trump being audited, etc. Goldberg bluntly interrupts the poppycock and says: It s bull! And it is.This went on for a little longer, but Conway was left utterly steamrolled by the end of the interview, and deservedly so. She s representing one of the most unqualified and smarmy scam artists this country has ever seen and has no right to even think about becoming president.

 WATCH: Mika Brzezinski UNLOADS Fury Against Trump And His Buddies For Fat-Shaming Women,"The men of Morning Joe found Donald Trump s insults against women funny, but Mika Brzezinski shut them and their disgusting sexism down HARD.Joe Scarborough and Willy Geist had a laugh over Trump s interview with Bill O Reilly on Wednesday night and seemed to have no problem with him fat-shaming women just because they gain a little weight.Scarborough tried to excuse Trump s behavior as  just trying to help  while Geist called Trump the real  hero of this story. A sickened Mika then jumped in and took Trump to the woodshed on behalf of women everywhere. It s a beauty contest. You can t actually have any weight on your body for a beauty contest because that wouldn t be beautiful. Think about that. Geist then cracked that women shouldn t  put on 60 pounds  and attributed the  joke  to Newt Gingrich, a supporter of Trump and his campaign. Really?  Mika asked.  That s the pot! People like Donald Trump and Newt Gingrich and men can walk around just rotund as all get out,  Mika continued. And it s not an issue. But women, in order to be beautiful, you have to be 117 pounds. I m sorry. Can someone tell me what year we re in here? Is it 2016? I think we re back in the 70s with these hideous pageants   which, by the way we need to talk about at some point. Someone who runs beauty pageants   you have to think about how they think about women.Look at those beauty pageants. Look at them! Young women walking around in bikinis getting graded on how they look. I can t believe we still do these things.Do we want someone who ran beauty pageants? And still thinks it s okay to talk about gaining weight being a problem? Do we really want that person in the White House? Hiring women? I don t think he s going to hire women unless they re tens. In his view, which is 117 pounds and starving and covered in plastic. Indeed, these sexists think it s okay for them to gain weight but they think women should be held to certain standards. And that s why Trump is getting his ass handed to him by women right now in the polls.Joe Scarborough repeatedly tried to interrupt Mika and talk over her throughout her rant, which is something he probably took a lot of flack about later after the show.In the end, however, Mika got the last word and made it clear that Trump s treatment of women is not something to joke about. It s disgusting. It s perverted. It s a serious story. Stupid men. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump s sexism should automatically disqualify him from seeking the presidency. Instead, Republican chose him as their leader and that demonstrated just how little they care about women, and if every woman in this country voted against Trump and the GOP every year, the party would go extinct.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"September 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary-Haters Send Death Threats To Arizona Republic For Endorsing Clinton,"After 126 years of endorsing Republican candidates for President, the Arizona Republic decided that they could not, in good conscience, endorse Donald Trump. Arizona is a solid red state with a solid red and oftentimes nutty conservative government, and some of the people of the state are so angry with the Republic for endorsing Hillary that the paper has lost subscribers and is now receiving death threats.Phil Boas, who s in charge of the Republic s editorial page, said: Well, it s been crazy around here. We re getting a lot of reaction both locally and national. I don t believe true readers of the editorial page are surprised by all this at all, because over the past year we have been writing scathing, scalding articles about Donald Trump. There may be some  true readers  of the editorial page who are angry, but it s just as likely that these are primarily Trumpkins and others who hate Hillary with a passion, and are pissed off that  their  paper has betrayed them like this. Trumpkins are known for advocating violence against anyone who disagrees with their chosen god, and Trump himself eggs them on.Trumpkins sent death threats to delegates who didn t want to support Trump at the RNC. The chairman of Colorado s Republican Party was told to go kill himself, and to hide his family and pray he made it all the way to Cleveland. A Jewish writer for The Huffington Post got death threats and wishes after calling Trump out for an anti-Semitic tweet.Trump and his loyal subjects have normalized this kind of behavior. Unfortunately, this behavior can lead to domestic terrorism, and anyone who carries out these threats would be considered domestic terrorists.Boas, and the Republic, are rightfully concerned about Trump s strong desire to destroy the free press because he can t take criticism. It s also his misogyny, racism, lack of presidential temperament and lack of any real policy proposals that pushed the Republic to endorse Hillary. Boas says the paper is  feeling the weight of our history  during this election cycle.The Republic may have endorsed the GOP candidate had it been Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush   candidates that were actually respectful, respectable and, in comparison to Trump, responsible. But they didn t, so the Republic stands by its decision to endorse Hillary, along with many other papers that have broken with decades of tradition. Trump is too distasteful for them, and his fans are just as bad.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Neo-Nazis Are Flocking To Trump’s Campaign And Openly Bragging About It,"The Nazis see Donald Trump as their pathway back to power so they are joining his campaign in droves.It s not exactly a secret that white supremacists, including neo-Nazis and members of the KKK, are supportive of the Republican nominee. But this election is especially different because of how emboldened they are about Donald Trump.Nazis in this country have been on the fringe of our society for decades, which is where they belong. But Donald Trump is giving them the seat at the mainstream table that they have desperately desired and Republicans don t see any problem with that at all.And that s why these racists are not only able to openly volunteer for Trump campaign, they are able to openly brag about doing so and have no problem boasting about the goals they are trying to achieve. There s a connection   it isn t always policy   but a deep visceral, you could say emotional connection between the alt-right and his campaign,  white supremacist Richard Spencer told the Los Angeles Times. I think he does recognize that he has this alt-right army behind him. I think he also realizes if he backs down, if he stops being combative, he is in danger of losing that. Indeed, Donald Trump has embraced white supremacists by retweeting their accounts on his own Twitter feed and using rhetoric that appeals to them.In fact, despite his attempt to paint Democrats as the real racist fascists in this election, Trump is actually the candidate that white nationalists are drawn to. Virtually every alt-right Nazi I know is volunteering for the Trump campaign,  said white nationalist Andrew Anglin.David Duke, the former KKK leader who is running for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana, bragged to the Times that Trump is where he is because of white supremacists.  Trump happened because of us,  Duke said,  not the other way around. The fact that Donald Trump s doing so well, it proves that I m winning,  Duke continued.  I am winning. And if David Duke wins, it means the Nazis and the KKK win, too.So are we as Americans really prepared to let the Nazis take over the United States? Because if they do, they ll have control of the greatest military on the planet and we need to remember that when Hitler and the Nazis took power in Germany the first nation they conquered was their own and it resulted in concentration camps, indoctrination, loss of rights, and the eventual destruction of the entire nation. We can stop this new generation of Nazis from gaining power in the United States simply by making sure Trump loses by a landslide in November. If not, we may end up needing a coalition of nations to liberate us one day and that means World War III.Donald Trump and his white nationalist supporters need to be stopped before it is too late.Featured Image: Twitter",News,"September 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" REVEALED: Trump Illegally Violated Embargo Against Cuba, Putting Money In ‘Killer’ Fidel Castro’s Hands","The  law and order candidate  broke the law again.Donald Trump recently declared that he would reverse President Obama s deal with Cuba to reopen diplomatic relations between our two nations after 50 years. All of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done with executive order, which means the next president can reverse them,  Trump said earlier this month.  And that is what I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands. Those demands include freeing political prisoners and expanding religious liberty.That s funny, because the Republican nominee certainly didn t give a shit about either of those things when he violated the United States embargo against Cuba back in 1998.A Newsweek investigation revealed:A company controlled by Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, secretly conducted business in Communist Cuba during Fidel Castro s presidency despite strict American trade bans that made such undertakings illegal, according to interviews with former Trump executives, internal company records and court filings.Trump s company spent a total of $68,000 for the trip to meet with government officials, bankers, and businessmen in order to gain a foothold on the island just in case the American government ended the embargo. But Trump broke the law and he tried to cover up his crime by funneling the money to a consulting firm and making it look like a charitable effort.In 1999, Trump traveled to Miami for the first day of his presidential run as the Reform Party candidate and hypocritically told the Cuban-American crowd that he would keep the embargo in place because any money spent there  goes to Fidel Castro. He s a murderer. He s a killer. He s a bad guy in every respect, and, frankly, the embargo must stand if for no other reason than, if it does stand, he will come down. And so, Donald Trump admitted that he gave $68,000 to  a murderer  and  a killer  who is  a bad guy in every respect. Now to make things clear, President Obama only reopened diplomatic relations with Cuba, which is within his executive power. The embargo is still in effect. But Republicans have whined about Obama s Cuba policy ever since.So what will they say about Trump s blatant violation of the embargo itself and the fact that he spent $68,000 on the trip, money that dictator Fidel Castro must have appreciated?If Republicans don t condemn Trump for this they will be committing hypocrisy at the highest level. It will make it clear for every American that they don t care about law and order as much as they care about power. Donald Trump broke the law and tried to make a deal with Fidel Castro s Cuba and he was merely a businessman. Just imagine what laws he could violate and get away with as president.Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump FURIOUS After Journalist Questions His Sexism, Stops Her In The Most DISGUSTING Way (VIDEO)","The insane thing about Donald Trump s horrific attitude toward women is that every time he is asked to defend himself, he only ends up validating the claims that he s a misogynist. His sexist, anti-woman views are so engrained in him that he honestly doesn t even know that he s proving everyone right   and a post-debate encounter between the business mogul and a female journalist displayed this perfectly.Alexi McCammond is an associate news editor for Bustle, and was covering Monday night s presidential debate at Hofstra University. While she was there, McCammond managed to get close to Trump and nab a very short, but very revealing interview with the Republican nominee himself. As she got closer to The Donald, McCammond started filming with her cell phone, stuck her hand out and asked Trump, How would you respond to young women who are nervous about voting for you? What happened next couldn t have been a better representation of how women will be treated under a Trump administration. This is what McCammond described: Trump then looked at me, grabbed my right wrist (which was the hand holding the phone), said,  Put that down,  and pushed my hand down.

 This Senator Has The PERFECT Response To Trump’s Remarks About Former Beauty Queen’s Weight,"Anyone with a heart knows that Donald Trump s public humiliation of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado is simply beyond the pale. Trump called the poor girl  Miss Piggy,  and referred to her post-pageant weight gain as, quote,  a real problem.  Well, The Donald isn t that slim and trim himself, so those in glass houses and all that. He is getting a lot of richly deserved backlash to how he is treating this beautiful, intelligent woman, and we all know how Trump responds to criticism   he can t take it all, and he lashes out.Well, we can soon look for him to be taking nasty shots at Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill on Twitter, because she had an absolutely brilliant response to the Miss Universe flap. Sen. McCaskill tweeted out that maybe Trump should have daily weigh-ins, and also snuck in a sly shot that referenced his health, seeing as how he keeps taking cheap shots at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton s health. Without further ado, here is the tweet:The D women Senators have talked & we're concerned about Donald's weight. Campaign stress? We think a public daily weigh-in is called for.  Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) September 28, 2016This is sure to get under The Donald s notoriously thin skin. No way is he going to be able to let this go, and that will keep this unseemly story in the news cycle for days to come. Personal feuds are what Donald Trump trades in   whether it s attacking a Gold Star family who dares to criticize him, a judge whose rulings he doesn t like, or a minister who refused to let him use her pulpit to attack a political opponent   and they ve never done him any good in this election cycle.This particular personality trait is one of the more glaring demonstrations of what makes Donald Trump so manifestly unfit for the presidency. The more it s on display between now and election day, the better.Good going, Senator McCaskill! He ll definitely take the bait. All we have to do is pop our popcorn and wait.Featured image Grant Lamos IV/FilmMagic",News,"September 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 FACEPALM: Gary Johnson Has ‘Aleppo Moment’ – Can’t Name A Single World Leader He Respects (VIDEO),"Poor Gary Johnson. Poor, poor Gary Johnson. One thing is for sure, this man is not destined to be president. He managed to make a total ass out of himself yet again, in what he called an  Aleppo moment,  when he couldn t name a single world leader he respects. Not one.In an absolutely cringeworthy moment during Wednesday s Town Hall event, Johnson ensured that he will never sit behind the desk in the Oval Office. MSNBC s Chris Matthews asked the Libertarian candidate to  name one foreign leader that he respects or looks up to.  Well, that was enough to stump Johnson.Johnson sputtered and stammered, but he couldn t come up with anything. Not one single name. You gotta do this,  said Matthews.  Anywhere. Any continent. Canada, Mexico, Europe, over there, Asia, South America, Africa. Name a foreign leader that you respect. The presidential hopeful finally said,  I guess I m having an Aleppo moment.  The best Johnson could come up with was  the former president of Mexico.  But he couldn t say which one. But I m giving you the whole world,  Matthews said.  Anybody in the whole world you like. Anybody. Pick any leader. Johnson couldn t do it. This guy wants to be president of the United States, but he can t come up with the name of even one lone foreign leader that he respects? How much weed is this guy smoking? And here s the part that really gets me, somehow, millennials who vehemently supported Bernie Sanders, are so blinded by their irrational hatred of Hillary that they are planning to vote for this f*cking moron. It boggles the mind.Watch Gary Johnson have another  Aleppo moment  here:Gary Johnson had an ""Aleppo moment"" after @hardballchris asks who his favorite foreign leader is #JohnsonTownhall https://t.co/nRazpPL0q0  MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 28, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: ‘The View’ Rips Trump For Not Having The Balls To Apologize For His Sexism,"Donald Trump is in deep sh*t because he refuses to apologize for sexist remarks he made about a Miss Universe contestant.During the presidential debate on Monday night, the Republican nominee took serious flack for fat-shaming Miss Universe contestant Alicia Machado just because she didn t conform to Trump s beauty standards for women.Hillary Clinton took Trump to task, informing him that Machado has a name and is going to vote in this election as are millions of other women across the country who also don t appreciate how he has treated women.On Tuesday, after Trump continued to insult Machado on Fox & Friends, the ladies of The View discussed his remarks and refusal to apologize, and even conservative panelist Jedediah Bila was disgusted by his behavior. Now this guy doesn t know how to apologize it seems, because this happened a long time ago and everybody has a past and all of us have said things that maybe we sit and say  I regret it,  the Fox host began.  It s seems though he doesn t regret it, because the comment here, the only acceptable remark is,  You know what? That was a long time ago when I was a different man and I m sorry. I m deeply sorry that I said those things. But Trump didn t apologize just like he has never apologized for any of the offensive remarks he has made over the years. He couldn t even apologize for his birtherism. That shows character, there s a character flaw here,  Bila declared before slamming Trump s supporters for blaming everyone around Trump instead of holding Trump responsible for his own personal words and actions.  And everybody wants to blame his handlers and say,  Why isn t he being told,  and I say, you know what, you re a grown man running for president, you re responsible for what you said, and you re responsible for owning up. And I don t care who your handlers are   grow up and say,  I m sorry. Joy Behar also summed up Trump s message.  The message is  don t vote for me,  she said.Here s the video via ABC.Donald Trump is not presidential material. He has no courage and zero moral fiber. He thinks he can say whatever he wants without consequence and while that may be the case on a reality show this is the political arena he is in now. Women represent more than half of the electorate, which makes pissing them off a very bad idea if the GOP hopes to stave off extinction. But his big mouth could have even more serious repercussions.If Trump pops off at the wrong time to the wrong people he could seriously affect our relations with other nations, especially nations with which we have serious tensions to work out. Trump s big mouth could easily sabotage crucial diplomatic negotiations or piss someone off enough to break ties with us. We need international cooperation now more than ever, especially if we hope to defeat ISIS. Insulting countries we need will not help us.And since he can t even treat most people in this country with respect, how can we really expect him to actually respect other nations?Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Comrade Trump Pushes Conspiracy Theory From Russian Propaganda Site,"The ties between Donald Trump s presidential campaign and the regime of Russian leader Vladimir Putin have been extensive and troubling as they ve been revealed over the course of the campaign. Trump has repeatedly praised Putin, despite his invasion of Ukraine and his belligerent attitude on the international stage, including his support of Syrian dictator Assad.In exchange, Putin has also had nice words for Trump, and it is believed that Russia is backing hackers who have attacked  Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.Now Trump has escalated the back and forth by promoting a delusional conspiracy theory that began on Russian propaganda websites. From CNN:Trump didn t cite a source to back up his claim, but the most recent report alleging this came from Sputnik News, a Russian state-owned news agency. Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton,  Trump said, apparently referring to Google searches during the first presidential debate on Monday night.Trump s remarks Wednesday night came two weeks after Sputnik News, a Russian government-controlled news agency, published a report claiming that Google search results are biased in Clinton s favor. Conservative news outlets, including Breitbart News, whose chairman became Trump s campaign CEO last month, linked to the report.Trump has surrounded his campaign with conspiracy theorists, including radio host Alex Jones, who is an ardent Trump supporter and who believes that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an  inside job  executed by the U.S. government. Jones also believes that the children murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary were  crisis actors. There is no truth to Trump s claim about Google, and it is very possible he got the information from Jones, who has alleged that he is in phone contact with Trump.Trump s supporters ate up the claim, as a majority of them visit and believe the same propaganda false stories as their leader does.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 S.C. Sheriff’s Dept. Just Said Townville Shooting Isn’t Terrorism Because Everyone Is White (VIDEO),"A teen opened fire at an elementary school in Townville, S.C., wounding a teacher and two students after allegedly killing his father. The shooter is in custody, and the sheriff s department gave a brief press conference as per usual for shootings like this. However, when discussing whether this could be called terrorism, Captain Garland Major gave a frankly disgusting reason for why this couldn t be terrorism: The students were both white males. The teacher was a white female. The shooter is a white male. There is no racial undertone, no terrorism involved. Oh really. It s only terrorism when it s, who, Muslims? Brown people in general? Them, in other words? Whether a violent act is terrorism depends partly on the reason it was carried out, not who carried it out. This shooter was 14 years old with no known relationship to his victims. Was it terrorism? We don t know, but it s racist as all hell to say  they were white, so it s not terrorism. Watch below, via Crooks and Liars:The fact is that domestic terrorists in the U.S. tend to white men. They also tend to be right-wing extremists and they re a bigger threat than ISIS, according to law enforcement. For a white sheriff s deputy to claim this can t be terrorism because everyone involved is white is abhorrent in the extreme.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama Has Harsh Words After Veto Override On 9/11 Bill: ‘It Was A Mistake’ (VIDEO),"President Obama had scathing words for the lawmakers who voted to overturn his presidential veto on a bill that will allow victims of terrorists to sue foreign nationals.The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) will allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia, the country where many of the terrorists were from. The bill passed Congress with a unanimous vote, but on Friday, Obama used his veto pen to strike the law down.However, the Senate voted 97-1 to overturn the president s veto and Congress voted in favor of the veto override 348-77, meaning the bill has now become law despite Obama s objections.This is the first time in Obama s presidency that lawmakers have voted to override his veto. According to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, it is the  single most embarrassing thing the Senate has done. Speaking to CNN s Jake Tapper, President Obama said their decision to override the veto  was a mistake. I think it was a mistake, and I understand why it happened. Obviously all of us still carry the scars and trauma of 9/11,  the president said, noting that there is a long list of resources available to help support the victims of this tragedy.Obama voiced his objections to the bill yet again, explaining that it will do away with sovereign immunity.  which win turn, put Americans abroad in danger of finding themselves facing private lawsuits in countries around the world. It s a dangerous precedent and it s an example why sometimes you have to do what s hard,  Obama said.  And frankly I wish Congress here had done what s hard. I didn t expect it, because if you re perceived as voting against 9/11 families right before an election, not surprisingly, that s a vote for people to take. But it would have been the right thing to do.

 Even His Allies Admit Hillary Won The Debate And Trump Is FREAKING OUT About It,"Unless you count online polls that Trump fans voted in multiple times to make it appear as if he won Monday s presidential debate, Donald Trump actually lost. Most pundits feel he lost, as did the focus groups used by several of the networks, as did scientific polls that were taken of people who watched the event. He lost, handily.Trump lost so badly that even his allies who want to see him elected President have been complaining to the media about his limp performance. And that has made Trump very very angry.In a conference call with surrogates Wednesday afternoon, Trump aides made clear the Republican nominee is upset that his allies publicly acknowledged they pushed him to change his preparation and tactics before his next bout with Hillary Clinton. And he wants them to stop it immediately.The message was  not subtle,  a source familiar with the call said.Trump wants his supporters to make an energetic defense of his performance and refuse to concede that he didn t nail it.In the world of Trump and his ego, admitting that you lost a battle is the worst thing, possibly even worse than actually losing the battle itself. For someone like Trump, who fancies himself an  alpha  male, an admission of humility or defeat is the worst possible scenario. In his eyes, anyone conceding that he underperformed is unacceptable, and even worse if you re in the Trump orbit.That is why Trump almost completely limits himself to media appearances on Fox News, where he won t ever seriously be challenged on even the most bizarre and untrue claims he makes in the campaign. Trump is inside a bubble, only speaking to those who agree with him and who want to suck up to him. He is being told time and time again by his hangers-on that he is doing everything just right. And he won t tolerate anybody who allows reality to intrude.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 New Poll EMBARRASSES The Hell Out Of Trump – He Lost To More Than Hillary,"While Trump crows about all the unscientific, self-selecting online polls that were rigged by his followers, the scientific polls with credibility are telling a very different post-debate story. One particular poll, which NBC conducted starting from the end of the debate on Sept. 26 into Sept. 27, shows Trump did so poorly that more people said neither candidate won than said Trump won.According to that poll, 52 percent of likely voters said Hillary won. 21 percent said Trump won, and 26 percent said neither candidate won.Image via NBC NewsOuch. Ouch ouch ouch. For someone who was only able to speak for 38 percent of the time, compared to Trump s 62 percent (and constant  Just shut up because I am God  interruptions), poll numbers like that are pretty astonishing.It s about as bad as when candidates finish worse than  none of these candidates  at the ballot box. Basically, there is nobody except the Trumpkins who believes Trump did anything of value Monday night. Furthermore, just 26 percent of Republican respondents said that the debate changed their opinion of Trump for the better. That s a pretty sorry number compared to 50 percent of Democratic respondents saying their opinion of Hillary changed for the better.Some Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill were disappointed in Trump and his performance, too. They wanted him to attack Hillary over the dead horse of an email scandal they re so sure makes her unfit to lead the country, and he didn t. Others, however, were frustrated with his inability to put forth succinct talking points: I wish that he d say something, stick with it, and then move on to something else instead of saying the same thing over and over and over,  [Arizona Rep. Matt] Salmon said in an interview Tuesday without giving specific examples.  It was just throughout the entire debate.' Anyone who tries to read a complete transcript of the debate will have the same frustration, if not worse. Trump literally cannot stick to the point, rambles on, talks in circles, etc., and Hillary wiped the floor with him in part because of that. The rest of it   well, she s eminently qualified and he isn t, and she proved it.The NBC poll was conducted online among a sample of 7,541 likely voters, culled from the 3 million adults who take surveys on SurveyMonkey every day. The margin of error is 1.6 percent, so Trump isn t even tied with  neither,  for second place. He finished dead last.Featured image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 RESULTS ARE IN: New Post-Debate Poll Shows MAJOR Swing In Very Key Demographic (VIDEO),"It s been a couple days since the first presidential debate, but the results are finally in, and it s not looking too great for one of the two candidates, especially in regards to the women vote.According to the new post-debate  NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll: Twenty-seven percent of likely women voters said the debate made them think worse of Trump. Meanwhile, nearly a third, or 30 percent, said their opinion of Clinton had improved, compared to 22 percent of men. Women were also far likelier to say Clinton won the debate, by a 10-point margin over men. It seems as if a lot of women are really put off by Donald Trump s temperament and not only how he treated Hillary Clinton during the debate, but women in general throughout his lifetime.One woman who was interviewed for the poll even admitted that she voted for Trump in the primary, but now is leaning towards Hillary Clinton.71-year-old Joan Hume of Fairfield, Ohio said: I m undecided, but I m leaning more towards Hillary than I ever have before because of the debate. Apparently, she wanted to see Washington shaken up, but she admitted: There s a side of him that s scary to me that I m seeing more of. I thought maybe he would change when he got the nomination, but he s getting worse. And while there are some women who apparently still think Trump is an acceptable choice despite his blatant misogyny and insults towards women, it s really not looking too great for the reality TV host considering if you want to win the White House, you need to win over women. And right now, it looks like Trump is losing while Hillary is gaining.The poll states this of independent women voters: Trump fared particularly poorly with independent women when they were asked if he has the  temperament and personality to serve.  Eighty percent of independent female voters said he does not. By contrast, independent women voters were more evenly split on Clinton s personality and temperament, with 51 percent saying she met the test for president. Yikes. That doesn t look so good for Mr. Trump.Here s the thing: Trump has a very, very long history of being absolutely horrible towards women, and the women who hadn t caught on yet are now finally starting to see the bigger picture. Chances are, more will jump ship to Clinton s side before November. At least if they re aware of the reality of the situation.Here s the take from MSNBC on the topic of women and Trump:Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Advisers Explain Why He Didn’t Practice For Debate And It’s INSANE (TWEETS),"There were a lot of memorable moments where Donald Trump looked like a moron during the presidential debate on Monday, but one of the greatest was definitely when Hillary Clinton zinged him for being so unprepared. Her exact words were,  I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. If one thing was completely apparent during that debate, it s that Trump didn t invest any time in debate prep. And apparently, Trump s advisers have just confirmed that. According to The New York Times, several Trump advisers have come forward to say they d tried to get him to prepare for the debate, but Trump would get too bored and start talking about other things. The Times wrote: Mr. Trump s debate preparation was unconventional. Aides have introduced a podium and encouraged him to participate in mock debates, but he has not embraced them, focusing mostly on conversations and discussions with advisers. There were early efforts to run a more standard form of general election debate-prep camp, led by Roger Ailes, the ousted Fox News chief, at Mr. Trump s golf course in Bedminster, N.J. But Mr. Trump found it hard to focus during those meetings, according to multiple people briefed on the process who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTrump had apparently been so difficult to keep on track that Ailes abandoned the whole thing and instead began  discussing his own problems, as well as recounting political war stories, according to two people present for the sessions.  Basically,  prep  became a therapy session for Ailes because Trump doesn t have the ability to focus on more important things, like getting ready to lead a country.Trump s debate performance has been disappointing for his advisers, who say they spent time giving Trump responses to the attacks Clinton might make during the face-off. They d given him several talking points and suggestions, but Trump didn t use any of it   something that his advisers say hurt him tremendously.So there you have it, America. A man who wants to be President of the United States doesn t even have the attention span or interest to prepare for such a critical position. We all know how undeserving Trump is of the White House, but this news should scare you. Trump is a ticking time bomb that has no idea what he s doing   and he s not going to learn.Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Michelle Obama Reacts To Trump Still Being A Birther, And It’s All You Hoped For (VIDEO)","If there s one thing anyone needs to know about the First Family, it s don t f**k with Michelle Obama, and really don t go after her man. Which is a lesson Donald Trump has yet to learn.Responding to the debate and the topic of President Obama s birth certificate where Trump seemed rather proud of himself for Obama revealing it, even though he continued pressing the topic, Michelle Obama struck back.She said: There are those who question and continue to question for the past eight years, whether my husband was even born in this country. And let me say; hurtful, deceitful questions deliberately designed to undermine his presidency. Questions that can not be blamed on others or swept under the rug by an insincere sentence uttered at a press conference. Then, visibly angry and insulted, she says: Let me take a moment.

 Sean Hannity Gets Chewed Out By Fox News For Citing Fake Polls To Support Trump,"Even Fox News is not pleased about Sean Hannity citing unscientific polls to claim that Donald Trump won the first debate with Hillary Clinton.Not long after the Republican nominee finished being clubbed by his Democratic opponent, the Fox News host was quick to use online polls as proof that Trump was victorious, even though such polls are often flooded by Internet users to skew the results in favor of one candidate or the other. I ll give you the list of polls,  Hannity crowed before listing Time Magazine, Drudge Report, CNBC, The Hill, and CBS as online polls that said Trump won. The only one that has Hillary winning is CNN and they re the Clinton News Network anyway,  Hannity complained.  CNN s poll had 500 respondents. These polls have thousands of respondents and CNN is the Clinton News Network. But all of these polls were online polls that are easy to manipulate and are simply inaccurate.And that why Fox News vice president of public-opinion research Dana Blanton sent out a memo calling out Hannity and other Fox hosts for using such polls . As most of the publications themselves clearly state, the sample obviously can t be representative of the electorate because they only reflect the views of those Internet users who have chosen to participate,  Blanton wrote. Another problem   we know some campaigns/groups of supporters encourage people to vote in online polls and flood the results. These quickie click items do not meet our editorial standards. News networks and other organizations go to great effort and rigor to conduct scientific polls   for good reason. They know quick vote items posted on the web are nonsense, not true measures of public opinion. Unfortunately, despite the fact that Fox News acknowledged that these polls are unscientific and should not be cited by their on-air personalities, Hannity and others apparently ignored the memo and continued touting them.Of course, it s pretty clear why Hannity would rather tout online polls. After all, a real scientific poll like one conducted by Public Policy Polling after the debate shows that most people surveyed said Clinton won the debate 51 percent compared with only 40 percent who said Trump won.In addition, the poll not only shows that Clinton won by a landslide among young voters, blacks, Latinos, and women, she beat Trump handily in more specific categories as well.By a 17 point margin, 55/38, voters say Clinton has the temperament to be President. On the other hand, by an 11 point margin, 42/53, voters say Trump does not have the temperament to be President. Among independents the gap is even wider- by a 56/36 spread they say Clinton has the temperament for the job, while by a 41/54 spread they say Trump does not.By an 11 point margin, 52/41, voters say Clinton is prepared to be President. On the other hand, by a 10 point margin, 42/52, voters say Trump is not prepared to be President.By a 21 point margin, 56/35, voters say they think Clinton can be trusted with nuclear weapons. On the other hand, by a 9 point margin, 42/51, voters say they think Trump can not be trusted with nuclear weapons.Once again, science proves that Hannity and Fox News are full of shit.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Andrea Tantaros Just Buried Fox News With Sworn Affidavit From A Professional Therapist,"Fox News needs to take Andrea Tantaros  sexual harassment lawsuit seriously because she refuses to back down.The conservative network has repeatedly belittled Tantaros and called her a liar ever since she slapped Fox News with a sexual harassment lawsuit naming Roger Ailes and Bill O Reilly.Tantaros has even dared her former Fox employers to take a lie detector test, even offering to take one herself because she has nothing to hide. But now Tantaros has some serious reinforcements who can back up her sexual harassment claims.As it turns out, the former host of Outnumbered was distraught enough about the demeaning working environment at Fox News that she saw a professional therapist starting in 2014 to deal with how she was constantly being treated by Fox bigwigs.Dr. Michele Berdy has now written a sworn affidavit confirming that Tantaros spoke with her about how Ailes would tell her to wear tighter dresses and how he would demand her to stand up and turn around so he could ogle her. Tantaros also told Berdy about Bill O Reilly s unwanted advances and how Fox PR chief Bill Shine ordered her to not file complaints about Ailes  behavior.Berdy wrote that after reading reports about Fox denying the claims, she reached out to Tantaros and gave her support. Over the course of many months (2014   2016), Andrea relayed to me on multiple occasions instances of Mr. Ailes s demeaning and overtly predatory behavior, as well as the abusive conduct of Fox News s public relations department,  Berdy wrote.Berdy confirmed that Tantaros spoke to her repeatedly about how she sought help from Bill Shine to make the harassment stop but he did nothing except basically tell Tantaros to just let it happen and allow Ailes to continue harassing her. In addition, Berdy confirmed Tantaros  claim that Ailes retaliated against her for refusing to comply with his sexual demands.Berdy also backed up Tantaros  story of how O Reilly approached her on multiple occasions to invite her to a private beach house, which he did because he had heard that she is  wild. Here are images of parts of the affidavit via Twitter.This is a pretty damning affidavit against Fox News, which has already had to make a pretty hefty payment to former host Gretchen Carlson over her own sexual harassment lawsuit against Ailes.The fact that Tantaros had to see a therapist to deal with the constant abuse at her workplace and that her complaints were documented long before she filed the lawsuit bring even more credibility and sympathy to her story.It s time for Fox News to clean house and fire the people who are responsible for covering for Ailes and it s time to fire anyone who sexually harassed female employees at the network, including Bill O Reilly and even Steve Doocy, whom Carlson named in her lawsuit.Fox News thinks they can bully Tantaros and make her lawsuit go away. But she isn t backing down and it s only getting worse for Fox the longer this lawsuit plays out.Featured image via Dangerous Minds ",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" President Obama Rips Sexist, Fat Shaming Trump A New One (AUDIO)","Monday night s presidential debate showed a stark contrast between two personalities. One was calm and cool, even under stress and the other was a bloviating braggart who couldn t maintain his temper.On top of those  qualities,  Donald Trump is sexist and he proved it Monday night when Hillary Clinton brought up Trump s record of fat shaming a former Miss Universe. President Obama, as the father of two girls and the husband of a strong woman, was having none of that. One of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest   he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them   and he called this woman  Miss Piggy,  then he called her  Miss Housekeeping  because she was Latina,  Clinton said Monday toward the end of the debate, as she ran through a list of things Trump has said about women.  Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November. Trump didn t really have an answer for Clinton, but the next day, he took to the talk show circuit and he doubled down on the fat shaming. On Fox & Friends, the morning after the debate, Trump said about Machado: She was the worst we ever had. The worst,  Trump said.  The absolute worst. She was impossible,  he continued.  She was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight. And it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that her attitude. We had a real problem with her so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl; this was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and it was not quite that way, but that s OK. Hillary has got to do what she has got to do. Source: AZ CentralPresident Obama had enough! He, like every American should be, was deeply offended at Trump s fat shaming. In a telephone interview with Steve Harvey on Wednesday, Obama said there s no way he wants that in the Oval Office: You had somebody who basically insulted women and then doubled down I think this morning in terms of how he talks about them and talks about their weight and talks about, you know, how they look instead of the content of their character and their capabilities,  Obama said,  which is not somebody that I want in the Oval Office. Here s the audio:One can only imagine that Trump would use a beauty pageant system to choose the women in his cabinet.

 Trump’s Deputy Campaign Manager Just Blamed Hillary For Bill’s Infidelities,"As Donald Trump continues to sink with female voters   including the crucial  white women with a college degree  who typically vote Republican   his campaign has decided that the best way to court these important voters the only way they know how: blame Hillary Clinton for Bill s infidelities.After failing to bring up the issue at the debate (in which Trump congratulated himself for not doing), surrogates like Rudy Giuliani told reporters Clinton was  stupid  for staying with Bill (because he has room to talk about cheating), and Trump hinted that in future debates the issue will come up.But it was Trump s deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, who had the most repugnant answer regarding Bill s decades old infidelities:I think that if you look at Hillary Clinton s background and if you look at her being an enabler, really, in the  90s and really attacking these women, it goes against everything that she now tries to spout as a candidate for president.So because Bill cheated that makes Hillary an enabler? Not leaving her husband in trying marital times somehow makes it all her fault and she should get the flack? Does that mean Ivana Trump was an enabler? Does that mean Marla Maples was an enabler? Who knows, maybe Melania is an enabler. Given Donald Trump s track record, it wouldn t be so far fetched to assume he s cheated on her already.And, my god, she attacked women who claimed to sleep with her husband while her husband was lying to her face? That never happens.David Bossie is what we would call a deplorable. His comments demonstrate a complete lack of sympathy, and an even deeper lack of political knowledge   women do not respond well to martial attacks. As RealClearPolitics writes, Donald Trump is still a long shot candidate for the White House. Why? Female voters do not trust him and he s losing with them, badly.What a great campaign strategy Bossie has: lose women at a record rate and then blame the first female candidate for her husband s cheating. That should go over real well with female voters, who already view Donald Trump as the sexist pig he is.Newsflash to Trump: having Kellyanne Conway, Katrina Pearson and Hope Hicks be the faces of your campaign won t save you when you have people like Bossie, Gingrich and Giuliani flapping their gums about marriage and infidelities.Featured image via Ben Jackson/Getty Images ",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Chelsea Handler Hilariously Trashes Trump’s Sons In Comparison To President Obama’s Daughters,"The prospect of President Obama and his family being replaced in the White House by Donald Trump and his family is a very depressing thought to millions of Americans, including comedian Chelsea Handler.During her show on Netflix this week, Handler lamented that we will soon have to say goodbye to the current First Family only to see a new family move in. I was midway through the debate when it hit me, we re going to have to say goodbye to the greatest family on the planet,  Handler said before putting up an image of the Duggar family and continuing,  And no I m not talking about these assholes. Handler then went after Donald Trump and his version of family values. While Hillary Clinton and potential First Gentleman Bill Clinton play with balloons on stage,  rotten apricot  Donald Trump  would rather play with his daughter s balloons. Handler admitted that she isn t a fan of children but conceded that Sasha and Malia Obama are  the exception. Look at them playing with their dog Bo! Isn t that cute?  Handler said before comparing the Obama girls to Trump s sons Eric and Donald Jr. Now, let s take a look at how the Trump boys play with animals,  Handler said as a photo of the two Trumps holding up a cheetah they killed appeared on the screen.  Two assholes in their natural habitat,  she quipped.Handler went on to list some of President Obama accomplishments and wished that he could run for a third term.Here s the video via YouTube:Handler isn t the only one who has slammed Trump s sons for using their daddy s wealth to kill animals instead of using it to help protect them for future generations to enjoy.Madonna slammed them earlier this month on her Instgram. How Big of [a] Pussy Do you have to BE to kill this Noble Animal for sport?  Madonna wrote.  Just ask Donald Trump Jr and his brother Eric.

 New Poll Shows 40 Percent Of Trump Supporters Think Minorities Have Too Much Influence,"When Hillary Clinton called out  half  of Trump supporters for harboring deplorable behaviors   which include, but are not limited to the following: racism, sexism, homophobia and Islamophobia   the GOP threw a hissy fit. How dare Clinton call out the Trump base, which does lean more in the direction of white supremacy than any other campaign base of support.The media crucified her, and called it her  47 percent  moment. But, as the facts have shown, she wasn t wrong.In fact, a new poll backs up her claim. Langer Research Associates, with the help of ABC News, found that four in 10 Trump supporters believe minorities have  too much influence  in America, while 1 in 5 said whites don t have enough influence.Certainly not  half  of Trump supporters, but close enough (and too close for comfort).Not surprisingly, those who hold the view that minorities have too much influence are also less educated, more conservative, and are die-hard Trump supporters:Holding these pro-Trump views -  that is, seeing too little influence for whites and men and too much influence for minorities and women -  peaks among strong conservatives and core Trump supporters, those who wanted him to win the GOPpresidential nomination. It s also more prevalent among conservatives overall, people who disapprove of Obama s job performance or feel they ve gotten worse off financially under his presidency, men and older, less-educated and less well-off Americans.Who would have thought that white Americans who hate the first black president would think blacks, Hispanics and Latinos have too much influence.These findings follow a disturbing trend among Trump supporters.No wonder Trump loves the poorly educated   they eat up his racist message and proudly expound it wherever they can.Just how many  deplorables  make up the Trump base of support teeters back and forth. it can be as much as 67 percent, and it can be as low as 40 percent. But the fact remains that a sizable amount, an influential amount, exist, and they are voting this year.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Harry Potter’ Star Compares Donald Trump To Voldemort And It’s PERFECT (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has frequently been compared to authoritarian leaders, but this recent comparison by Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe is just the thing we need to hear after Trump s horrendous performance on Monday night s presidential debate.Radcliffe happens to know a lot about evil leaders, having become an expert on them in Harry Potter. Especially after spending a lot of time with the film s own Lord Voldemort, the villain who is hellbent on putting non-magical humans in servitude forever. Hmm that sounds an awful lot like a horrible time period in American history that Donald Trump would like to return this country to In an interview with the U.K. s Sky News, Radcliffe actually compared Trump to Voldemort, stating that the Republican nominee has a lot in common with the Dark Lord   however, there are also big differences. And as a matter of fact, that s actually a BAD thing for Trump. It turns out, Radcliffe thinks that Trump is worse than Voldemort. The actor said: I sort of think Donald Trump might not be as  ideologically pure as Voldemort. My thing on Trump is that he feels like more of an opportunist, like I don t know how much of this stuff he s saying he actually really, really believes. Radcliffe also called out Trump s racism, stating that Trump is an opportunist that uses his divisive rhetoric to gain power. You can watch the interview below:Daniel Radcliffe has revealed why Donald Trump and Voldemort aren t so similar to @SkyCinema s Craig Dillon https://t.co/xiUe9BPc40  Sky News (@SkyNews) September 27, 2016Hilariously, this isn t the first time that Trump has been compared to a fictional villain.

" Arizona’s Largest Newspaper Breaks 125 Year Tradition, Backs Democrat For President","Since 1890, The Arizona Republic, now the state s largest and most popular newspaper, has seen over 30 presidential elections. And every time, they have endorsed the Republican contender   Eisenhower, Nixon, Goldwater, Ford, Reagan, H.W. Bush, Dole, Bush, McCain, and Romney.This year, something changed dramatically for the editorial board   they put country over party, and endorsed Hillary Clinton, the Democrat, over Donald Trump, the Republican.Once again, Hillary has broken a glass ceiling.Writing that Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who can lead America forward, the editorial board did not mince words with their hatred for Donald Trump.  The 2016 Republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified,  the board writes just after pointing out that they have a deep admiration for conservative principles.The board also pointed out that Hillary is by no means a conservative (rather a centrist), but in the grand scheme of things, Trump s bombastic, offensive, divisive and racial language is contrary to what America stands for, and this against what they argue to be real conservatism:Trump s conversion to conservatism is recent and unconvincing. There is no guarantee he will name solid conservatives to the Supreme Court  Trump s inability to control himself or be controlled by others represents a real threat to our national security. His recent efforts to stay on script are not reassuring. They are phony.Ouch. Not only is Trump a faux conservative in their eyes, he s a con man who s trying to lie his way into the presidency. Luckily, the Arizona Republic sees right through his xenophobic nonsense.While chiding Trump for his bromance with Russia and complete lack of world knowledge and foreign diplomacy, the paper highlights Hillary s ability to take a composed and headstrong approach to the issues facing America abroad:Clinton has argued America s case before friendly and unfriendly foreign leaders with tenacity, diplomacy and skill. She earned respect by knowing the issues, the history and the facts. She is intimately familiar with the challenges we face in our relations with Russia, China, the Middle East, North Korea and elsewhere. She ll stand by our friends and she s not afraid to confront our enemies.Quite possibly the biggest factor in the Republic s decision was Trump s treatment of Mexico and the hardworking, honest people that live there and the immigrants that  enrich  Arizona culturally, economically and diplomatically.When you I aunt Mexico and its people, you insult Arizona and its people.Trump is learning the hard way that words have consequences, and that decent people and decent entities will stand up to his bully pulpit.That is why the Arizona Republic put people over party and made the right decision.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Millionaire Sean Hannity Tried To Fake Being Middle Class, Gets DESTROYED On Twitter (TWEETS)","Fox News host and Donald Trump cheerleader Sean Hannity got busted for trying to pretend that he is something that he s not.In the process of yet again defending Trump, this time after his disastrous debate appearance on Monday night, Hannity lashed out at the press: Now, my overpaid friends in the media, well, they have their chauffeured limousines, they like their fine steakhouses and expensive wine lifestyles. Based on that statement, you might think that Hannity was just a regular Joe Sixpack, toiling away for a middle-class income at best, trying to make ends meet while paying his mortgage, electric bill and keeping his family fed.But of course, as the host of a highly rated cable news show and a nationally syndicated radio show, Hannity is anything but underpaid.For his radio show alone, Hannity earns  at least $20 million a year, and he has also signed a multi-million-dollar contract for his Fox News program.A few years ago, Hannity listed his waterfront home in New York for sale, asking $3.6 million for 4 bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms set on 2 acres of land on the Long Island Sound. Hardly the home of a middle class family.Almost immediately, journalists and political operatives and pundits started making fun of Hannity s weird statement on Twitter. The fact that Hannity, whose wealth is well-known, would attack journalists for being rich struck many as completely absurd. It was pointed out that he reportedly has a net worth of $80 million, has a private jet he s used to ferry politicians like former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich around, and even has done ads for the pricy steak house Ruth s Chris.Hannity thought he could get away with this white lie on Fox News, where this sort of thing happens all the time, but especially since he has attached himself to Trump, it isn t going to work anymore.Sean Hannity travels on a GD private jet.

 Right-Wingers Actually HONOR The Cops Who Killed Freddie Gray (VIDEO),"The Media Research Center, a right-wing media analysis organization, held its annual black-tie affair last week. The Baltimore police officers who are directly responsible for the death of Freddie Gray last year attended, were brought up on stage, and applauded and honored and giving a standing ovation for their work, all while a right-wing talking head glossed over the problems of police brutality.Deneen Borelli, a frequent Fox News contributor, complained loudly that these cops  lives and careers were ruined by the  lies  surrounding Freddie Gray s death. Gray died after his spine was nearly severed due to a rough and unsecured ride in the back of a van. He was handcuffed and put in leg irons, but not belted in at all. Later, officers said he d suffered a medical emergency, but they failed to get him help.Borelli lamented: These five men and one woman, all veteran police officers, were now in handcuffs, fighting for their lives, their careers destroyed, bankrupted, humiliated No one apologized for ruining their lives. No one thanked them for their service or recognized their honor. Who will thank these officers? Who will thank all police officers   at a time they are being so vilified? Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we will. This is disgusting.Patently disgusting.The media doesn t jump to vilify the police   we have a serious problem with police brutality, particularly against the black community, and the media is shining a light on it. In Baltimore, officers who were witnesses to the case were also on the team investigating Gray s death. Lead detectives started their own counter-investigations to disprove the state s case. The system works for officers, and against their victims.Victims like Freddie Gray. While Borelli whines that nobody s apologized to these officers who, in her view no doubt, were merely doing their duty and then braved the aftermath with grace and courage, Gray is still dead. He died as a direct result of these officers  actions.To point this out, though, makes us anti-police. We re police-haters when we point out brutality. Idiots like Franklin Graham say the best way to stop this is for people to just comply with police orders, and yet, many of the black people who die are complying with police orders.Seriously, the Media Research Center ought to be ashamed of itself for this. These cops  lives and careers wouldn t have been ruined if they d actually done their entire job.Watch Borelli s remarks below, beginning at the 1:11:50 mark:Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch This 9-Year-Old Girl’s Heartbreaking Message About Blacks And Police Brutality (VIDEO),"9-year-old Charlotte, North Carolina girl Zianna Oliphant is already tired in her very short life of seeing black men and women die at the hands of police officers.Oliphant spoke about her fears at a meeting of the Charlotte City Council and it was heartbreaking.[ad3media campaign= 941 ]Zianna and her brother, Marquis, both spoke at a City Council meeting in which members of the city s black community called for changes after police fatally shot an African-American man, Keith Lamont Scott, last week.Police say Scott was armed. The shooting death and questions over the use of deadly police force against people of color sparked protests that roiled the city. We are black people and we shouldn t have to feel like this. We shouldn t have to protest because y all are treating us wrong,  the girl said Monday.  We do this because we need to and have rights. In a later interview with NBC, Oliphant said the emotion of the issue hit her as she spoke, and that s why she began crying.Her mother, Precious Oliphant, pointed out that Zianna and Marquis are involved in a police youth league and have frequently been around police officers in a positive fashion. But they are still aware of the problems of discrimination and racism at a very young age because as their mother she has been frequently pulled over for police for what she believes are trivial issues, like the way she wore her hair.Zianna says she plans to become a doctor when she grows up, and speaking up as she did, she is obviously well on her way to being a community leader. Others around her and in positions of leadership and authority in her community could do far worse than to follow her example, as she is clearly wise beyond her actual years.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 FRAUD: Architect Who Was Scammed For $100k Exposes The Real Trump (VIDEO),"During Monday night s presidential debate, Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of screwing thousands of his workers out of the wages that they owe him. It was a shining moment for Clinton, that highlighted how Trump s entire fortune comes from not his business savvy, but his unending greed and eagerness to exploit anyone he can. Before saying that she is glad that Trump never did business with her father, she directly told Trump that he needed to apologize to all those he hurt, saying: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they ve produced and then refused to pay them? One of those people that Trump stiffed over is an architect named Andrew Tesoro. Tesoro sat down for an interview on MSNBC Live, where he revealed how Trump did not pay him the $100,000 dollars that were owed to him for helping to a clubhouse at one of Trump s many golf courses. Tesoro was asked whether he was paid for the work he had done on the clubhouse. He responded by saying: No, he didn t. He paid partially along the way and the project snowballed over a four year period and our role in the project snowballed as well. We became very much involved in interior design and construction stage work. We made many supplemental agreements as we went along and in the end those agreements were not honored. Because Trump will do anything to distance himself from his fraudulent business practices, he recently asserted that Tesoro probably wasn t paid because of shoddy work. That comment should really be biting him in the ass now. That s because Tesoro revealed that Trump had written him a letter of recommendation in 2006. In the letter, Trump praised Tesoro for his work. Tesser s experience is not unique. It seems like every day that more people are coming out in droves and exposing the various ways that Trump has royally screwed them over.One report has been particularly damning. USA Today found that Trump has been involved in over 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades. They also found that he has left everyone from cabinetmakers to carpenters left without being paid in full, or on time. While those numbers certainly make it easier to understand how far reaching Trump s fraudulent practices are, hearing it from someone who was a victim of them makes it so much more real.You can watch Tesoro expose Trump for scam artist in his own words below.

 Watch Joe Biden Take Trump’s Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO),"If there s anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesn t mince words, and will say what needs to be said, it s Vice President Joe Biden.While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Monday s debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.Biden said: This is a guy who said   and wants to be president   that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about? Adding: Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are. Then really getting to the core of it, he said: He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don t take pleasure from  You re fired.  They don t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit. Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage. He acknowledged that he didn t pay taxes because, he said, he s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me. Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates: If this choice isn t clear, I don t know  - my lord  What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people. And it s true, the choice is abundantly clear   Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.Watch Biden lay into Trump here:WATCH: VP Biden goes off on Trump over Trump s comments about not paying taxes:  It angers me!

 HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night’s Debate,"The earliest actual poll to come out of last night s debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate. However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be?Here s The Huffington Post to answer that question:Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday s debate?  Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outlet s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.There s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last night s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.Of course, the Trumpkins aren t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:@HuffingtonPost someone s upset that #Trumpwins  Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016@HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys?

 Howard Dean Just Doubled Down On Trump’s Possible Cocaine Use (VIDEO),"Allow me to begin by saying former DNC chair Howard Dean is the f*cking man. After tweeting that Donald Trump might be on cocaine   a reasonable observation based on the GOP s actions during the first presidential debate   he could have backed down under scrutiny. He could have caved and apologized. Instead, he made his case.Dean, a physician who is qualified to speculate   though in his own words not diagnose without examining Trump in person   responded to criticism of his remarks on MSNBC. I don t make diagnosis on the television, it s medically improper,  he told Kate Snow Tuesday, a subtle jab at Trump and his legion of Fox News  doctors  feverishly trying to diagnose Clinton with every neurological disorder under the sun because she coughed that one time and contracted pneumonia the other.  But I don t think this was a ridiculous idea. Something funny was going on with Trump last night. Something  ridiculous  was indeed going on. Trump spent his evening screaming about ridiculous conspiracy theories, attacking his opponent s  stamina  based on a minor illness, interrupting Clinton constantly, guzzling water, sweating profusely, and other things that would be expected from his meth-addled Twitter followers rather than a serious presidential candidate. Here s the interesting constellation: he sniffs during the presentation, which is something that users do. He also has grandiosity, which is something that accompanies that problem. He has delusions, I m not talking about being crazy, but for example when he told everybody he was very smart not to pay taxes and then denied that he said after he said it it in front of 100 million people,  Dean said.  He thinks somehow he s not going to get caught, that is delusional. He has trouble with pressured speech,  the former Vermont governor added.  He interrupted, as you pointed out, Hillary Clinton twenty-nine times. He couldn t keep himself together. Do I think at 70 years old he has a cocaine habit? Probably not,  Dean concludes. But it s something that I think would be interesting to ask him, to see if he ever had a problem with that. Asked for clarification if he thinks Trump has a  cocaine habit,  Dean replied  I don t think he has a cocaine habit,  placing special emphasis on the word  habit.  In other words, it might be a stretch to say Trump is addicted to cocaine, but it is possible that he used it to pep himself up before the debate.In an effort to deflect from the allegation, Trump assured the public that he just had a cold, but Stephen Colbert put it best when he said The Donald  sounded like he was trying to get over a cold using cocaine. We can t know for sure if Trump has ever been treated for addiction, as he refuses to release his records   and since Trump should be held to the same standards to which he holds Hillary Clinton, it s not unreasonable to question if he has been using cocaine (especially given the crazy, whacked-out bonkers stuff he says in public).Watch Dean SLAY this interview below:Featured image via screengrab, Getty Images (Joe Raedle)",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mexico’s Former President Unleashes Brutal Insults On Trump After Debate (TWEETS),"Mexico s former President, Vicente Fox, isn t shy at all about his disdain for Republican nominee Donald Trump   and he really turned things up a notch after last night s presidential debate.Anyone who watched the debate (or has access to the internet) knows by now that Trump blew it. His performance was so weak and he was so unprepared, even Republican pundits have admitted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won by a landslide   and Fox wasn t afraid to point this out. On Tuesday, Fox decided to go after Trump while it s going to hurt the most, knowing full well that the business mogul s ego is likely suffering from embarrassment.On Twitter, Fox teased Trump mercilessly for his horrendous performance, directly asking Trump  what does losing feel like?  on Twitter. To rub this in even more, Fox posted a screenshot of one of Trump s pathetic fundraising emails, proving to the world that Trump s campaign is still struggling and begging for money: @realDonaldTrump you have no shame, I just got another e-mail begging for help. Tell me what does losing feels like? Have a little dignity! @realDonaldTrump you have no shame, I just got another e-mail begging for help. Tell me what does losing feels like? Have a little dignity! pic.twitter.com/avrV9WKG9T  Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) September 27, 2016Continuing to pour salt into the wound, Fox also praised Clinton for showing  capacity, compassion and wisdom  while bashing Trump for looking  afoul.  The attack was brutal:TwitterTwitterIt s been awhile since Fox has been in the media for attacking Trump, but he sure knows how to make an appearance. This election cycle, the former President of Mexico has repeatedly made headlines for slamming Trump and publicly stating that Mexico will not pay for his f*cking wall. Fox has also said that Trump  reminds me of Hitler  and even challenged Trump to a debate once (which Trump was too cowardly to accept). We can only expect that over the next few weeks, Fox is going to support Clinton to the fullest, and do whatever he can to convince Americans not to vote for Trump.Featured image via Win McNamee / Pool Getty Images",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Even His White Supremacist Base Knows Trump Blew It (IMAGES),"Monday night s debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was so one-sided that virtually everyone, short of the most ardent Trump supporters, thinks the GOP candidate tanked, bigly.Social media isn t pretty for Trump. Even his white supremacist base is doubting him after his subpar performance in Monday s debate. Here are just some from Stormfront. If you aren t familiar with Stormfront, they are proud  white nationalists  and they are very pro-Trump. They re still pro-Trump, but they know that their candidate dug himself a hole on Monday night. Here are a few of their posts, courtesy of the Concourse:Stormfront isn t the only group that believes Hillary  mopped the floor  with Trump. 4chan, the alt-right message board, was filled with disheartened white supremacists (our favorite kind). They were filled with excuses, but the overwhelming opinion seemed to be that their candidate was beaten by a woman.Some were offended when Trump said the DNC hack could have been orchestrated by someone weighing 400 pounds and sitting on his bed.White nationalists aren t the only conservative voters complaining that their candidate lost. I m not positive Hillary actually won the debate. But I m sure Trump lost it. He choked,  writes Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol.Ouch, when Bill Kristol turns on you Even if you are a Trump supporter, you have to think that he left a lot on the table,  writes GOP supper lobbyist Ed Rogers, a veteran of the Reagan and Bush 41 White Houses.  He didn t see the openings and he didn t swing at the softballs that came his way. He never used the word  change,  he didn t bore in on Hillary s email scandal and he never got around to the Clinton Foundation and Hillary s suspect integrity. Trump was inarticulate and rarely hit the bull s eye. Not exactly giving props to Hillary, but After the first 20 minutes, it may have been the most lopsided debate I ve ever seen   and not because Clinton was particularly effective. But you don t need to be good when your opponent is bad,  writes National Review s David French, who considered running for president as an independent.  Why didn t he have a better answer ready for the birther nonsense? Has he still not done any homework on foreign policy? I felt like I was watching the political Titanic hit the iceberg, back up, and hit it again. Just for fun. The Washington Post has a bunch of other conservative reactions.While it s doubtful the white supremacists or any of the other quoted conservatives will pull the lever for Hillary Clinton, it is clear that Trump showed his vulnerabilities last night and he proved that he s not fit, at all, to be Commander-in-Chief.Featured image via Michael Bocchieri/Getty Images",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Guy Who Forgot 9/11 Happened Says Hillary Is ‘Too Stupid’ To Be President Because She Stayed With Bill,"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani decided to weigh in on future President Hillary Clinton s ability to perform as President in a worse way than Trump s  stamina  remarks at the first presidential debate. According to Giuliani, the fact that Clinton is strong enough and loves her husband enough to make things work after he was unfaithful to her is actually a sign of weakness that disqualifies her from being President just as much as That One Time She Coughed and her almost superhuman ability to work hard and power through pneumonia for days before she finally collapses from the unnatural amount of strain she put on her body. The president of the United States, her husband, disgraced this country with what he did in the Oval Office and she didn t just stand by him, she attacked Monica Lewinsky,  Giuliani said following Monday s debate.  And after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if you didn t know the moment Monica Lewinsky said that Bill Clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, then you re too stupid to be president. Bill Clinton didn t actually  violate  anybody. He fooled around with a woman, who was an adult and consented to everything they did, behind his wife s back. While she certainly had the right to be angry, and Americans absolutely have the right to criticize him (he was wrong, but it didn t affect his ability to run the country), to say that she is a weak person for staying with him is absolute bullsh*t. Clinton s strength is in her ability to forgive, to think of the bigger picture, to make her marriage work in spite of a very, very public affair.Of course, this is the sort of thinking that can be expected from a guy who was Mayor when the planes hit the twin towers on September 11, 2001, yet recently completely forgot about those attacks while he was criticizing President Obama, who paraded his mistress around for all to see, and who told the media he was divorcing his wife before he informed her or their children. Under those eight years, before Obama came along, we didn t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack inside the United States,  Giuliani said in a speech in youngstown, Ohio earlier last month. They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office.

" Trump Is Full Of Sh*t, He Most Certainly Has Said That Global Warming Is A Chinese Hoax (VIDEO)","Donald Trump is an established denier of climate change and lover of absurd conspiracy theories. During the first presidential debate on Monday, Hillary Clinton slammed him for claiming that global warming is a Chinese hoax: Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese,  Clinton said on the debate stage.  I think it s real. I think science is real. Trump promptly interrupted her to declare that he hadn t ever said anything of the sort.  I did not, I did not,  countered Trump.  I do not say that. Go figure, this was a boldfaced lie. In 2012, Trump tweeted this:Trump later claimed he was just joking after Bernie Sanders nailed him to the wall for this ridiculous theory, but he still insisted that climate change is a hoax that benefits China. Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I d be   received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke,  Trump said to Fox News in January.  But this is done for the benefit of China because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn t care less. They have very   you know, their standards are nothing. But they   in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it s very hard on our business. The GOP nominee has repeatedly claimed that global warming is a  hoax.  He argued this point on Fox News in 2014.And his Twitter feed abounds with similar statements.Sooner or later, you d think Trump would learn that lying about what he has said doesn t work, especially if it was said on television or social media. But apparently, this is a lesson that hasn t quite sunk in yet.Watch Trump lie about claiming that global warming is a Chinese hoax, here:Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Katrina Pierson Just Blamed Hillary Clinton For Trump’s Stop-And-Frisk Plan (VIDEO),"Following the presidential debate, Donald Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson opened her mouth on CBS and stupidity just flowed out of it. Pierson was on the show to discuss Donald Trump s debate performance on Monday. When Trump wasn t sniffling, he was interrupting Hillary Clinton.Naturally, Pierson blamed Hillary Clinton for Donald Trump touting the stop-and-frisk policy, which by the way, was ruled unconstitutional in 2013.During the post-debate panel, Pierson was asked to comment on Donald Trump s recent proposal to get more cities to adopt the kind of stop-and-frisk policy in New York that was found unconstitutional back in 2013. As a shock to no one ever, Rudy Giuliani, a huge Trump supporter, is and was a proponent of the racist policy.Pierson took another route and blamed Clinton, because of course: In responding, Pierson said that stop-and-frisk was effective at stopping crime and was not really racist   but then she blamed Hillary Clinton for stop-and-frisk being necessary because of her own racism. It actually did work in New York,  Pierson said of the stop-and-frisk policy.  But we have to get down to why, because that s why we re here today. We have two candidates who have very different views. The reason why we have this problem, the reason why stop-and-frisk was implemented, was there were disparities with regard to who people were pulling over,  she continued. She went on to say: And it s profiling, criminal profiling, not necessarily racial profiling, even though it comes across that way. But the reason why we had it was that we had the First Lady of the United States who went out on the national stage and dehumanized young black children  this has been the conditioning of the American public where black children have been demonized, Hillary Clinton owns that. Watch:In late August, Trump tweeted,  How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth  SUPER PREDATORS    Has she apologized? Yes, Hillary Clinton made the  super predators  remark more than 20 years ago, but it was not directed toward African-American children.This is nothing new for Pierson. Just last month, she blamed President Obama for Iraq war deaths in 2004.Featured image via screen capture.

 Howard Dean ROASTS Trump Over Debate Sniffles: ‘Coke User’? (TWEETS),"In the first half of the debate, Donald Trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles. After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trump couldn t stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)?Howard Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs.Dean, who is now a contributor for MSNBC, tweeted last night:Notice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user?  Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016Trump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system.And considering he hasn t released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state.Of course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be.Dean s assertion is just that   an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anything she s not.If this debate showed one thing, it s that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it. Why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? Howard Dean is.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Giuliani Already Trying To Float Excuses For Trump To Weasel Out Of Future Debates,"Anyone watching Monday night s highly charged presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump knows that Hillary cleaned Trump s clock. Of course, Trump s ego will never let him admit that he lost to Hillary, so his surrogates are already being deployed all over the place to spin his embarrassingly terrible debate performance into something positive. The verbal gymnastics there are astounding, but of course these people are Donald Trump surrogates, so they are used to spinning faster than the head of the girl in The Exorcist. One Trump surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, is taking things a step further, though, and trying to float the idea that Trump should refuse to do future debates with Hillary.Of course, this is just a cowardly move because of Trump s abysmal performance. But Giuliani is the Trump Spinner-in-Chief, and instead decided to blame the fact that NBC moderator Lester Holt actually called Trump out on his lies on his suggestion that Trump should skip out next time. Giuliani whined that Holt s fact-checking was unfair treatment of Trump, and therefore if it were him, he wouldn t debate again without certain petty, childish demands being met: If I were Donald Trump, I wouldn t participate in another debate unless I was promised the journalist would act like a journalist, and not an ignorant fact check. My advice would be the moderator would have to promise they d be a moderator. When pressed, Giuliani refused to say whether or not he would advise Trump to find a way out of debating Hillary again, only that if it were him, it is what he would do. This is in direct contrast with Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who insists Trump will do both future debates.While both candidates had nothing but good things to say about Holt s moderation, Giuliani lit into Holt regarding the stop and frisk question, saying that the moderator s  interference regarding the controversial policy and its effects on New York City was  outrageous.  However, considering that Trump has floated the idea of a nationwide stop and frisk policy, the discussion on that subject and its racist implementation was perfectly reasonable. That didn t stop Giuliani from outright lying in his rant, though, when he said: If journalism has ethics, Lester Holt unethically interfering in the area of law he knows nothing about. It is not unconstitutional and Trump s description of that case was correct. But, again, this is a lie   a federal judge definitely ruled the policy unconstitutional.At the end of the day, Giuliani s tantrum is only because he wants his candidate to be able to lie with impunity in front of millions, because most Trump voters are low information plebes, or they simply don t care about Trump s bigotry, lies, incompetence, and just general all-around douchebaggery. However, if he gets called out on a debate stage, it makes him look like a fool to undecided voters, who are much more likely to vote for Hillary if they are going to leave third-party camps.If Trump drops out of future debates, he and his surrogates will blame Lester Holt, the so-called  liberal  media, and anyone and anything besides Trump himself. Rudy Giuliani is just laying the groundwork for that right now.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Gives PATHETIC Reason For Why He Sucked At Debate (TWEET),"If you tuned into the first presidential debate last night, you already know that Hillary Clinton pretty much wiped the floor with Donald Trump. Trump was so nervous and unprepared that he was reduced to constant sniffling, excessive thirstiness and his usual outlandish rants and interruptions. Let s just say that everyone noticed.Trump couldn t take the heat, and he definitely cannot handle the humiliation that is following the debate. While several major media outlets are calling the debate a clear win for Clinton, Trump is trying to come up with reasons why he bombed so horribly (even though it was perfectly obvious that he would).The best excuse Trump has been able to come up with is beyond pathetic and nothing but a move of desperation. The Associated Press has reported that after the debate, the GOP nominee immediately told reporters that he was unable to perform to the best of his ability because there was something wrong with his microphone. And yet despite something being  wrong with it,  that mic seemed to work fine as he shouted over Hillary every few seconds. AP reported: Trump visited the media spin room after the Monday night debate and said,  They gave me a defective mic! He said he  wonder(s), was that on purpose? CBS s Sopan Deb also happened to be there and gave a little more detail into Trump s microphone conspiracy theory:TwitterTrump is seriously trying to claim that someone tried to sabotage the debate on purpose! What a moron. The truth is that Trump didn t prepare for the debate like Clinton did   and even if he had spent a little more time preparing than tweeting, it wouldn t have mattered much   he s completely unqualified for the White House. Last night, Hillary showed America that these two shouldn t even be up against each other. There is no comparison. Hillary looked like our next President, and Trump looked like a fraud and an imposter who should have never made it up on that stage.I wouldn t be surprised if Trump comes up with more lame stories about why his performance was compromised last night.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here You Go: Every Bat Sh*t Crazy Thing That Came Out Of Trump’s Mouth In The First Debate,"Donald Trump spent Monday night making a total ass out of himself in the first presidential debate. We were all waiting to see just what would happen tonight, and it was quite the spectacle. From lies to self-incrimination, watching the GOP nominee s performance was the equivalent of one facepalm after another.So here you go, a complete list of every batshit crazy thing that came out of Donald Trump s mouth during the first presidential debate: There s nobody in our government to fight them [China], and we have a very good fight, and we have a winning fight. They re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China and many other countries are doing the same thing. We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies. Our country s in deep trouble.  We don t know what we re doing with devaluations  Especially when it comes to China, they re the best.  They re the best ever at it. What they re doing to us is a very very sad thing. That s called business, by the way.  (referring to making money off of the 2007 financial collapse) I m a great believer in all forms of energy  Our country is losing a so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. I will bring back jobs.  You can t bring back jobs. That s about all you ve got.  (referring to Clinton s book We Are Stronger Together) You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.  You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.  You are going to drive businesses out. I m going to cut taxes, big-league.  You are going to raise taxes, big-league. And take a look at mine also.  (referring to his campaign website) She tells us how to fight ISIS on her website.  I don t think Douglas MacArthur would like that too much  You re telling the enemy everything you want to do.  No wonder you ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life. Well, I m really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs.  They re going to expand their companies.  They re going to do a tremendous job.  (hahahaha) I m getting rid of the carried interest provision, and if you really look, it s really not a great thing for the wealthy, it s really a great thing for middle class.  (methinks thou dost protest too much) These people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies.  And when they re going to bring 2.5 trillion dollars back from overseas, where they can t bring the money back because politicians like Secretary Clinton won t allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape is so bad.  (or because those companies are greedy and un-American, just saying) So, what they re doing is leaving our country, and believe it or not, they re leaving our country because the taxes are too high.  Because some of them companies have lots of money outside our country, and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they can t work out a deal.  And everybody agrees it should be brought back, instead of that they re leaving our country to get their money because they can t bring their money back into our country, because of bureacratic red tape.  Because they can t get together, because we have a President that can t sit them around a table, and get them to approve something.   (maybe companies should just pay their taxes so we don t need to cut valuable public services) We have no leadership, and honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton  Why not [blame Clinton for everything]? We re in a bubble right now, and the only thing that looks good is the stock market. We have a FED that is doing political things  the FED is being more political than Secretary Clinton When we have a country that s doing so badly, that s being ripped off by every single country in the world, it s the kind of thinking that our country needs. We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.  (in response to a question about his taxes) I ve been under audit for almost 15 years.  I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.  I say,  Have you been audited?   I get audited almost every year, and in a way I should be complaining.  I m not even complaining.  I don t mind it.  It s almost become a way of life.  I get audited by the IRS, but other people don t. We have a situation in this country that needs to be taken care of.  I will release my tax returns against my lawyers wishes That makes me smart.  (in response to paying zero dollars in federal income taxes) I could give you a list of banks, if that would help you.  I would give you a list of banks.  These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.  I could do that very quickly. I have a tremendous income.  The reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. Our airports are like from a third world country  We ve become a third world country.  The worst of all things has happened. And it s really a shame. And it s politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We re a debtor nation. We re a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don t have the money, because it s been squandered on so many of your ideas. It would be squandered, too, believe me.  (in response to not paying any federal income taxes) Maybe he didn t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work  Which our country should do, too.  (referring to not paying people who worked for him) But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn t get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.  Now, if you want to change the laws, you ve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I m running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that s what I do.  (referring to bankrupting four companies and not paying his business debts) But what she doesn t say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I ll give you an example. We re just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don t get there one way, I m going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn t want to use a couple of words, and that s law and order. And we need law and order. If we don t have it, we re not going to have a country. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. We have to be   we have to know what we re doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. No, you re wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it s allowed.  (referring to racial profiling becoming outlawed as unconstitutional) We need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what s happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it s very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen. I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I m very proud of. These are very, very good people. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn t be on there, we ll help them, we ll help them legally, we ll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. They ve been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that s what it is. They ve controlled these communities for up to 100 years. You know, you ve seen me, I ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that s OK. But I will tell you, I ve been all over. And I ve met some of the greatest people I ll ever meet within these communities. When I got involved, I didn t fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I m satisfied with it. And I ll tell you why I m satisfied with it But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job Well, it was very   I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing. But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I ve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.  And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect.  And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn t work that way. You were after him. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father s company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country   it was a federal lawsuit   were sued. We settled the suit with zero   with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don t do on you. Maybe I m trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look   I look at that, and I say, isn t that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it s just one of those things. I ll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it s a tremendously successful club. And I m so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I m very, very proud of it. And that s the way I feel. That is the true way I feel. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we re not. I don t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She s saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don t   maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don t know, because the truth is, under President Obama we ve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they re beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is   it is a huge problem. I have a son. He s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it s unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it s hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that s true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better and certainly cyber is one of them. So she talks about taking them out. She s been doing it a long time. She s been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn t have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn t have had them.  (speaking about the creation of ISIS) Or, as I ve been saying for a long time, and I think you ll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil   and we should have taken the oil   ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil   a lot of the oil in Libya. Wrong  Wrong.  Wrong. The secretary said very strongly about working with   we ve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone s ever seen. But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they re going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they re going. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren t paying their fair share. Number two   and that bothers me, because we should be asking   we re defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because   and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest   but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that s great. And I think we should get   because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It s a lot of money to protect other people. But I m all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.  And they re going to do that. And that was   believe me   I m sure I m not going to get credit for it   but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn t believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can t believe it. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it s in over 30 countries. And you re going to stop them? I don t think so. That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she   frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media. Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There s no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know? I have a much better   she spent   let me tell you   she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising   you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names   oh, temperament, let s go after   I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don t know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there s a person with a temperament that s got a problem. Wrong  It s lies That line s getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to It s not an accurate one at all. It s not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things   and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your   your president thinks.  Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we re losing a fortune. That s why we re losing   we re losing   we lose on everything. I say, who makes these   we lose on everything. All I said, that it s very possible that if they don t pay a fair share, because this isn t 40 years ago where we could do what we re doing. We can t defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We re a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out. Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their   they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. We are not   we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it s over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can t take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we re doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. Why didn t you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody s ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.  So you say to yourself, why didn t they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. And they re going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he s not a happy camper. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it s getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they re in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations. And she doesn t say that, because she s got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn t have that. All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don t believe that Hillary has the stamina. The world   let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it s bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last   so she s got experience, that I agree.  But it s bad, bad experience. I never said that  I didn t say that  Where did you find this?  Oh, really? You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it s said in entertainment. Some of it s said   somebody who s been very vicious to me, Rosie O Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her. But you want to know the truth?  I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself,  I can t do it. I just can t do it. It s inappropriate. It s not nice. Wow. In hindsight, it would have probably been easier to list the things Trump said that weren t completely and utterly ridiculous. When it finally came time to face off with Hillary Clinton on the debate stage, Trump failed miserably and totally embarrassed himself. As Hillary said Monday night, Donald  lives in his own reality,  presumably a reality where he thinks he actually makes sense.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Megyn Kelly Takes A Shot At Hannity By Wondering When Trump Will Talk To A Real Journalist,"Fox News host Megyn Kelly seemed to take a shot at Sean Hannity on Monday night after the much anticipated first presidential debate when she had to throw the live coverage to an interview between her colleague and Republican nominee Donald Trump.Hannity has been a prime target for just about everyone ever since Trump was formally nominated during the last night of the Republican National Convention in July. Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart got the ball rolling that night by torching Hannity for being a complete hypocrite when it comes to how he has covered President Obama in the past to how he treats Donald Trump now.Not long after that, Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens called Hannity the  dumbest anchor on Fox News,  and the Washington Post followed up by calling Hannity out for lying about Trump coming to the rescue of U.S. Marines.Then CNN s Brian Stelter piled on by nailing Hannity for lying about Hillary Clinton, and Newsweek reporter Kurt Eichenwald slammed Hannity for claiming that Hillary suffers seizures.And now Hannity is getting shade from one of his own colleagues.During the post-debate analysis on Fox News, Kelly had to introduce Hannity s interview with Donald Trump. And as she introduced the interview, Kelly wondered if Trump would be talking to the actual journalists in the room afterward. We ve got Trump speaking to our own Sean Hannity. We ll see whether he speaks to the journalists in this room after that interview. Here s the video via YouTube.Trump and Hannity proceeded to trash Hillary Clinton, but it looks like the main focus will be on Kelly for basically telling a lying commentator like Hannity to go f*ck himself.And he definitely deserved the shade. After all, Hannity is not a real journalist. He ignores facts and peddles bullshit and frankly shouldn t be allowed anywhere near the airwaves. Hannity is Trump s puppet and he clearly cannot be fair and balanced as the network he works for advertises.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Insists Stop And Frisk Wasn’t Ruled Unconstitutional – He’s Wrong, It Was (VIDEO)","The first presidential debate was Monday and let s just say that Donald Trump had a very bad night. One of the GOP candidate s easiest lies to expose was his insistence that  stop and frisk wasn t ruled unconstitutional. He s wrong, it absolutely was.Debate moderator Lester Holt asked Trump about his recent arguments in favor of  stop and frisk  and mentioned that the court has declared the practice unconstitutional on the grounds that it is discriminatory. Stop and frisk  was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men    Trump cut Holt off mid-sentence: No, you re wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. Factcheck: U.S. District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled  stop and frisk  to be unconstitutional August 12, 2013. According to the Center for Constitutional Rights, Judge Shira Scheindlin found the NYPD s practices to violate New Yorkers  Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and also found that the practices were racially discriminatory in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, The Bloomberg administration did appeal the ruling. The order was then suspended by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the case was sent back to be tried again with a new judge presiding over the proceedings. However, the court shot down the city s motion and decided not to vacate Scheindlin s decision. The appeal was eventually dropped by the de Blasio administration.Trump, who has run a bigoted campaign right from the start, was completely undeterred by Holt s assertion of the facts and continued to argue vehemently in favor of the discriminatory policing practice.Watch Trump wrongly argue that  stop and frisk  wasn t ruled unconstitutional, even though it was, here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Maher’s #DebateNight Live Tweetstorm Was The Most Glorious Trump Takedown EVER,"It s no secret that Bill Maher, comedian extraordinaire and host of HBO s Real Time, is no fan of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. So, of course he couldn t resist live tweeting the entire first general election presidential debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The whole thing was one brilliant insult against Trump after another. Here are a few of the better tweets:GOP won expectations game when it nominated an orangutan.

She's right, she shld be 50 points ahead.

He made an absolute fool of himself. There s just no way around it. Of course, his uneducated core supporters will still vote for him, but there s no way this one got the undecided voters into Trump s corner.

 Donald Trump Attacked Clinton’s ‘Stamina’ And Her Response Was Absolutely Brilliant (VIDEO),"After Monday s debate, Donald Trump almost certainly wishes he had been covered in honey, placed on top of a colony of fire ants, and kicked in his surely gold-plated testicles repeatedly as someone reads  Twilight  to him rather than face Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head matchup.Moderator Lester Holt reminded Trump that he said Clinton doesn t have a  presidential look  and asked him what he meant by that. She doesn t have the look,  Trump replied.  She doesn t have the stamina. I said she doesn t have the stamina and I don t believe she does have the stamina. To be President of this country, you need tremendous stamina. Clinton, who was an absolute badass the entire debate, just stood there. And laughed. And smiled. And let him talk. Then, when it was her turn, she turned the burn up to 9,000 degrees: Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a ceasefire, a release of dissidents, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.

 Trump Literally Just Said He’d Take Guns Away From Anyone Without Due Process,"In discussing shootings and crime in the first of three presidential debates, Donald Trump not only greatly exaggerated the number of shootings in Chicago, and claimed that stop and frisk was both constitutional and effective, he also advocated taking guns away from people without due process. Of course, he thinks that the police would only take guns away from criminals, and that the Constitution is different for criminals, but everyone has a constitutional right to due process. Doesn t matter to Trump, though: We have to take guns away from bad people that shouldn t have them. Those were Trump s words in the debate, where he defended stop-and-frisk as constitutional despite the fact that it was literally ruled otherwise, and has also been deemed ineffective. How the NRA can possibly support a candidate that would take guns away from anybody at all without due process is beyond us. That s especially true given the fact that this isn t the first time Trump has said this: [Police officers are] proactive, and if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think they have a gun, they will see the person and they ll look and they ll take the gun away. They ll stop, they ll frisk and they ll take the gun away, and they won t have anything to shoot with. The 2nd Amendment cannot exist without due process. The NRA is literally supporting a candidate who would take guns away from law-abiding citizens. Literally.Featured image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"September 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Won’t Tell America Where His Products Are Made, So Here’s A Handy Guide (IMAGES)","Donald Trump constantly talks about how he ll  make America great again.  He ll bring jobs back, put America first, all that populist, nationalist jazz that put him in the position of being the Republican nominee in the first place. However, there s one thing Trump can do to help Americans get more jobs: he can actually make his own products in the United States of America.Well, since Trump won t readily make his manufacturing practices available to the American public on his own campaign website, Hillary has given us a handy guide complete with images, on hers. She calls it  A Buyer s Guide For Donald Trump.  While Donald Trump says that it s very hard to have apparel made in this country,  or   they don t even make the stuff here. It s so hard to get.  Hillary proves him wrong right away. Here is a handy map of where Trump can get all of his things made, right here in America, courtesy of HillaryClinton.com:Hillary then goes ahead to list the individual categories on this map, complete with lists of places that each kind of product can be made. For instance, here s all the places Trump can make ties:Instead, he makes them in China. And that is just one example. Go to Hillary s website for a full list. In other words, Trump s rhetoric is just that: bluster and bombaste for the sake of excusing his anti-American business practices. If Trump wants to bring jobs back to America, he can start with his own companies.Thanks for the handy guide, Hillary! No doubt Trump will never read it.Featured image via Sara D.

 New Study Proves America Keeps Getting Better And Better Under Obama,"The cornerstone of Donald Trump s presidential campaign can be summed up in just a few words: Things suck and it s all Obama s fault. For Trump, this tweet pretty much optimizes his take on poverty:Our country does not feel  great already  to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2016This was in response to President Obama saying during the Democratic National Convention that  America is already great. So, who is correct? Are Americans trapped in a socioeconomic hell hole or are things far more optimistic? According to a study published by the New York Times, things are vastly better for Americans than they were when Obama took office in 2009.The article began by profiling Alex Caicedo of Gaithersburg, MD. A few years ago, Caicedo was struggling with odd and part time jobs. He and his family were forced to live with his mother-in-law. Today, he has a steady middle class job with benefits and the family is ready to move out of his mother-in-law s home. They are far from alone.The Caicedos are among the 3.5 million Americans who were able to raise their chins above the poverty line last year, according to census data released this month. More than seven years after the recession ended, employers are finally being compelled to reach deeper into the pools of untapped labor, creating more jobs, especially among retailers, restaurants and hotels, and paying higher wages to attract workers and meet new minimum wage requirements.What about the minorities, who, according to Trump, have never had it worse? Well, that s another Trump lie. Not only have minorities suffered much, much worse throughout history (slavery, Jim Crow), but they too have it dramatically better since Obama took office.Poverty declined among every group. But African-Americans and Hispanics  who account for more than 45 percent of those below the poverty line of $24,300 for a family of four in most states   experienced the largest improvement.Sorry, Republicans, but you don t get an ounce of credit for the improvements. If anything, things would be much better if Republicans weren t in office. The Times credits social programs like Social Security and food stamps for keeping people out of poverty. They also credit the fall in oil prices for people being able to commute to their jobs. One major factor, and Republicans will hate this, is that the increases in minimum wage are also taking people out of poverty.After a long period of rising inequality, Elise Gould, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington, added, the benefits of the improving economy finally began to seep downward. Wage increases were  even stronger at the bottom than in the middle,  she said.Still, it s not enough. 43 million Americans still live in poverty. Republicans have successfully blocked poor people from acquiring college degrees or job training that might help raise people out of poverty. For those without access to computers or the internet, finding a job can be burdensome. For those who can t afford cars, a job search can be impossible.If this proves anything, it should be that it s time to continue successful Democratic policies, not cut them off at the knees, as Republicans would do.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,"September 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Biographer Says Trump Might Not Actually Be A Billionaire: ‘He Just Makes It Up’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s lies are catching up to him one by one, and the latest person to call him out is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and biographer David Cay Johnston.Some of you may not know who Johnston is, but he is the author behind The Making of Donald Trump   so he knows quite a bit about who the erratic business mogul is and isn t. In a newly released video, Johnston claims that there is absolutely no proof that Trump is the billionaire he says he is   adding another layer of deceit and fraud to Trump s already horrendous track record.The clip was published by Business Insider, where Johnston goes through Trump s bragging claims and compares them to the actual data on the business mogul s court records and bank filings. For example, Johnston says that last year, Trump said his net worth was $8.7 billion, $10 billion, $11 billion and higher,  even though there was nothing going on in the economy that would suggest that kind of gyrations of net worth.  The truth is, Trump is lying though his teeth. Johnston said: The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump just makes it up. Johnston also brought up a court testimony where Trump said he uses his gut  feelings  and  emotional state  to determine his net worth. Johnston joked about how  nuts  it was, and imitated Trump s strategy: By the way, I m having a great day today. I think my net worth must be at least a billion dollars. Johnston has been trying to get America to believe that Trump s billionaire status was fake since 1990. During that time, a net worth statement by Trump s bankers said that the GOP nominee s net worth was actually negative $295 million.Johnston is still standing by the claim that Trump isn t as successful as he seems, and continues to insist that although Trump is well off, there is  no evidence that he is a billionaire.

 Republican Gov Wrecked Economy So Bad He’s Started Censoring Reports,"Kansas is bleeding money and jobs and Governor Sam Brownback doesn t want the people to know how devastating his economic policies have been.In 2011, the Tea Party governor was so confident that his economic policy of massive tax cuts for the wealthy and reduced spending would turn Kansas into an economic powerhouse that he created a special group charged with writing reports on the results.But Brownback s experiment has failed so spectacularly that the state is billions of dollars in debt, education funding is suffering, and job growth is pathetic. So pathetic that Kansas is losing more jobs than it has gained.In January, Brownback couldn t handle a report put together by his group that admitted  Kansas sometimes was faring worse than it had before Brownback became governor,  so he made every effort to cover it up.In other words, he censored it because his group was supposed to report that the economy is soaring, not falling to the ground like a rock.Kansas Center for Economic Growth executive director Heidi Holliday blasted Brownback for killing the report. He specifically asked the council to hold him accountable through rigorous performance metrics. Five years later, the metrics clearly show his tax experiment has failed while business leaders and local chambers of commerce across the state openly ask him to change course. In fact, Brownback is so desperate to keep the people of Kansas from calling for tarring and feathering him in a public square that he is turning to the federal government. Instead of writing their own independent reports, the group is now restricted to getting their information from the Federal Reserve, which conservatives often claim is responsible whenever economic issues occur.That particularly surprised Kansas House Minority Leader Tom Burroughs, who was quick to point out the irony. The missed revenue marks, missed job reports, missed projections shed light on his failed policies. I kind of find it a little ironic they chose to go to a federal government report after they blamed President Obama for our economic problems. Governor Brownback s economic experiment is a complete failure and a joke. Kansas  economy is now in shambles and Republicans have no one to blame but themselves. They believed that by implementing an extreme conservative fiscal policy without interference from Democrats that they would prove trickle-down economics as a total success. Instead, it failed miserably and now they want to censor any results from being reported.By all rights, Brownback should have ousted by voters in 2014. But now Kansas is stuck with him and his failed policies for at least another two years. Meanwhile, the wealthy are laughing all the way to the bank.Featured image via Liberalbias.com",News,"September 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Jewish Elders Warn Their Grandchildren: Vote For Hillary, ‘We’ve Seen This Before’ (VIDEO)","This election will ask us to choose one of the following: an overqualified, dignified woman, or a fascist, xenophobic billionaire. The woman, Hillary Clinton, has dedicated her life to fighting for the rights and dignities of all, while the man, Donald Trump, has fought only for himself and his pockets.One group that tends to vote Democrat   but has been leaning a little more towards the right recently   are Jewish people. In 2008, 78 percent of Jewish Americans voted for President Obama, as did 74 percent in 2012.This year is different. Instead of facing off against John McCain or Mitt Romney, the Democrats are facing off against the definition of fascism and xenophobia. And they have a message to their grandchildren: vote for Hillary Clinton.Why? Because they ve seen this before.In a video titled  A Message From Grandma & Grandpa: We ve Seen This Before,  a group of elderly Jewish Americans plead with their younger generations to get out and vote, and warns against the type of man Donald Trump is. They  enlisted some powerful allies in the effort to defeat Donald Trump: grandparents.  And they aren t holding back: This is probably one of the most important elections, because there is so much is at stake. Of course, their experiences with Germany take front and center: We have seen this before. We saw it in Germany, and don t want to see it again. Their hatred for Trump is not hidden, and for good reason: Trump is more than a tyrant. He s an obnoxious lying individual and I haven t any respect for him. I have tremendous fears for the country and and for you, my grandchildren. Adding some lighthearted (but important) humor, one grandparent tells their grandkids: If you vote the future is yours. If you don t vote for Hillary, and that crazy man Trump is elected, I ll haunt you when I die. Another promises to be a major spoiler: I ll spoil every episode of  Game of Thrones. When you re having a dinner party, I ll come down and say something racist, but if you re voting for Trump, you probably don t care. The powerful video, sponsored by Bend the Arc Jewish Action, was released to warn future generations not to forget their history, and to listen to the wisdom of their elders, especially ones that know oppression when they see it: We, as Jews, recognize that [Trump s] candidacy has echoed times when the Jewish community experienced the dangers of fascism, anti-immigration and persecution against religious minorities. We ve seen this before and we wanted to make sure that as Jews we were speaking out boldly and loudly and making sure it was known the Jewish community rejects Trump for the platform of hatred and bigotry that he has unleashed.

 Georgia Trump Supporter Preparing For Civil War If Hillary Clinton Wins Election (AUDIO),"Donald Trump supporters are so desperate to be in power that they are threatening America at gunpoint to vote for him or be killed.That s what Georgia Trump fan Jimmy Arno is preparing for after the election votes are tallied in November because he expects a bloody civil war to break out in order to overthrow the government before Hillary Clinton is inaugurated.Arno is even considering joining a right-wing militia, whom he collectively refers to as  patriots,  because he seriously believes only they can defend the Constitution. Should martial law, civil war   whatever   break out in this country, they will uphold the Constitution and rebuild our loss,  he said.  The war that s going to break out if Hillary Clinton s elected, if that happens. Your patriots are going to overthrow the government. And of course, Arno is a fan of the Confederacy, loves the Confederate flag, and has a portrait of Robert E. Lee hanging in his living room.So basically, what Arno is saying is that he believes the South will rise again and a civil war sequel will turn out differently. This time a rebellion will somehow succeed even though the United States military, including a navy and air force, would be standing in their way.Nevertheless, threats of civil war and violent rebellion are frightening but they also prove that conservatives are unfit to govern because apparently the only way they can do so is with a gun pressed against the heads of the people.Arno went on to blame President Obama directly for the high racial tensions. I know that we were a whole lot further along racially eight years ago than we are today,  he claims.But the fact is that Republicans raised those racial tensions themselves by vowing to make President Obama fail from the start simply because of the color of his skin and their claim that he is an illegitimate president. The birther movement, of which Trump is a prominent leader, contends that President Obama is not one of us and that he wasn t born here. The election of President Obama made racists, including Arno, mad so they started publicly throwing a hissy fit and their tantrums have only gotten worse in the last eight years.Here s the audio via NPR.Trump supporters are deplorable people who want to shoot and kill anyone who disagrees with them just so they can watch the world burn. If Hillary Clinton is elected president as she should be, conservatives need to accept that they lost instead of resorting to taking up arms against the country. Such an action is treason and would only demonstrate that they are nothing more than sore losers who should never be allowed to get close to political power ever again.Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable   except by Hillary Clinton.But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics  . Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator   to call out those lies and to do that in real time.Unfortunately, with Trump s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to  shine  at the debate if she hopes to  win.  This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.If there is one thing this election has shown us, it s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.Featured image via Sara D.

 Watch Trump’s Campaign Manager Crash And Burn While Claiming Trump Doesn’t Lie (VIDEO),"Defending Donald Trump is no easy task, but even his most prominent campaign members are struggling to make sense of his behavior and comments.When MSNBC s Morning Joe had campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on board to talk ahead of the Monday night debate between Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Trump s righthand woman couldn t have been any more defensive and avoidant. In all honesty, she failed miserably to make her candidate look good, and choked under the pressure.Bloomberg Politics host Mark Halperin, who was also a guest on Morning Joe with Conway, asked the Trump campaign manager about Trump falsely accusing the debate moderator, NBC s Lester Holt, of being a Democrat. He asked: He said Lester Holt was a Democrat. Lester Holt is a Republican. How could he say such a thing that just black-and white factually incorrect? It was a fair question, and Conway wasn t ready for it. Her response was basically that Trump was not a liar; he just spoke without knowing the truth. Conway responded: I don t know that he knew what Lester Holt s voter registration is. Halperin wasn t letting it go. He pressed Conway, repeating back to her what she d just said: Without knowing then, he asserted he was a Democrat? Conway then tried to use one of her boss  favorite interview tactics   dancing around questions. She fired back: First of all, if you tell me the media are not overly populated with Democrats, that s false. At this point, Halperin is getting frustrated and tries to keep Conway focused. He points out just exactly what was wrong in Trump s comments about Holt: I m asking about a very specific thing. He made a factual claim about the moderator who deserves the right to be treated fairly and it was just wrong. And it s a metaphor for his frequently in public stating things with no basis, that are wrong. Again, instead of responding, Conway began talking about the backlash NBC s Matt Lauer received after being  too nice  to Trump. It then becomes obvious that Morning Joe s Mika Bzrezinki is also losing her patience, when she says,  This is a filibuster  while Conway rants on. Halperin once again tries to bring the conversation back: You re not answering what I asked you. I m asking you how someone running for president can assert on the eve of the debate that the moderator is a Democrat, which is factually incorrect? How can he do that? He shouldn t have asserted  he didn t say,  I don t know what he is, but I think he s biased,  he said he s a Democrat. Conway left this topic again to attack Hillary Clinton and the media, and Brzezinski had to refocus her by saying, I don t understand what that has to do with Mark s question. We were asking why he lied about Lester Holt. Conway finally says,  I don t think he lied  and Brzezinski corrected her, Um, I think he did.  Conway then gave this moronic reply: Mika, a lie would mean he knew the man s party registration. Co-host Joe Scarborough had to cut the conversation short, but not before an exasperated Halperin could ask, So as president, would he say things that are false without knowing the truth? You can watch the interview below:.@KellyannePolls: Trump  didn t lie  about Lester Holt,  a lie would mean that he knew the man s party registration  https://t.co/dZWTCwpoim  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) September 26, 2016Featured image is a screenshot",News,"September 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NC Civil Rights Museum Tells ‘Disrespectful’ Trump To Go F*ck Himself,"Lately, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been making a show of reaching out to black voters. Of course, it hasn t been actual black people he is speaking to; after all, other than Uncle Tom types like Omarosa and Don King, that s a voting bloc he s never going to win. No, he s trying to send a signal to white voters who can t stomach voting for an overt racist that he s not, well, racist. He s trying to make them forget all the racist garbage he s spewed throughout this campaign and throughout his life.Perhaps the most despicable part of this so-called  outreach  is the fact that he is using the black community to try and score political points. He is going to black churches and troubled communities to try and convince people that he cares. Well, one place that Trump tried to use on his crazy outreach tour has completely rebuffed him: The International Civil Rights Center and Museum in Greensboro, North Carolina.According t0 Earl Jones, co-founder of the museum, Trump s team made a list of exploitative demands that disrespected the museum staff and insisted upon special treatment for Trump   including closing the place down for hours on end so that Trump could come. Well, that wasn t happening for sure, Jones said. The co-founder went on to say of the Trump camp s request: We did not honor the request of the Donald Trump team because we thought they demonstrated, in their approach was disrespectful, so therefore we did not grant that request.The approach, the type of disrespect, pretty much a demand and bullying us to use the museum in their manner and their way in their time,  it was inappropriate and I think it s probably reflective of the type of insensitivity of civil rights and human rights that s reflective from Trump over the years. Who wouldn t want to be a fly on the wall when Trump got THIS news? That was probably a temper tantrum for the ages. Kellyanne Conway probably had to take his phone for hours on end so that he wouldn t attack these people on Twitter for daring to stand up to his blatant and aggressive attempts to use them to score political points.Anyone who isn t completely tone deaf here knows that Trump doesn t give a damn about black people   or anyone else, for that matter   and it s about time that some of these places stop allowing Trump to use them to engage in his disgusting brand of dog whistle racist politics.Well done, International Civil Rights Center and Museum, and Earl Jones. It s about time someone called Trump on his shit.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox Host Whines How It’s Not Fair That Men Can’t Condescend To Women,"Ahead of tomorrow night s debates, where Hillary will have an abundance of facts, figures, experience and knowledge at her disposal while Trump will only have misogynistic insults and outright lies at his, a Fox host is complaining that television is home to reverse sexism. Why?Because men can t condescend to women on TV, and that s just not fair.Wah wah wah someone bring the guy a tissue before he blows his nose all over the women he s working with. Bill Hemmer was speaking with Jessica Tarlov about the debate, and Tarlov said she feels it s absolutely appropriate for Hillary to criticize Trump s misogyny and racism while onstage. When Tarlov began listing specific examples of Trump being racist and misogynistic, she said,  I could go on, obviously,  to which conservative lobbyist Matt Schlapp said,  You are! Hemmer cut in with: We work in television. And I ve always thought that when a man and a woman is on television, a woman can be sarcastic or even, perhaps, a little condescending toward a man and it s okay. But a man can never do that to a woman and get away with it. Watch below:While Hemmer s logic might sound reasonable on the surface, here s why it s not: Reverse oppression (racism against whites, sexism against men, discrimination against straight, cisgender people, etc.) doesn t exist because oppressors can t suddenly become the oppressed. Oppression, particularly by straight, white, cis, Christian men, is woven into our society. It s insidious. And while yes, men can experience prejudice and stereotype, our society is built by men, for men. Prejudice and stereotype are not the same as oppression.It s not about one person being an asshat to another, which is what Hemmer is really whining about and equates with so-called  reverse sexism.  When Schlapp responded to Tarlov s litany of Trump sins with,  You are!  he was putting her in her place, not arguing her point. That is sexist. That s relegating her and her arguments into the background as irrelevant on the basis of her gender, not the merits of her argument.As a woman, Tarlov can t send a man back into the background because he s not in the background to begin with, as she is. That s just the way it is.Since Hemmer works for Fox Noise, though, it s only natural that he probably won t even attempt to understand this.As far as Trump and the debates, Hillary won t be putting Trump in the  man s place  when she calls him out on his sexism, racism, etc. She can t   but he can try and put her in her place and he does it all the time. She s calling out fundamental flaws in Trump that make him unsuited to lead a country that desperately needs its oppressive structures torn down. He, on the other hand, will build on those very structures.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"September 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Black Protesters Drove David Duke Out Of His Own Racist Protest,"David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard, finally got what he deserved when he was forced out of a racist protest on Saturday in New Orleans, Louisiana.The protest Duke attended was to counter the Take  Em Down NOLA protest, which was calling for the removal of a Confederate statue of Andrew Jackson   but fortunately, Duke was stopped when a crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters chased him away. Sadly, this confrontation didn t occur before Duke could share some of his white supremacist rhetoric with the crowd. Duke preached: I tell you one thing. It was built by the forefathers of the European Americans who created this country and who gave us our constitution. Who gave us our freedoms and they should not lose their rights and liberty in their own country. They should not have their statues taken down. They should not lose their culture of this society. I am here to defend our American heritage. Our Louisiana heritage and our New Orleans heritage. But it didn t take long before protesters surrounded Duke, and started calling him out. A crowd gathered and chanted things like Racist, fascist, anti-gay!  and  Right-wing bigot go away!  These protesters refused to let up until they had forced Duke out of Jackson Square completely.TwitterYou can watch the video of Duke being driven out by protesters below:David Duke is yet another racist white man who serves as a major threat to this country. Duke is not only one of Donald Trump s most racist, loyal supporters, but he is now running for Senate in Louisiana after being inspired by the support that Donald Trump s hateful rhetoric has received from racist voters.Trump has created an environment where racists like Duke believe they can thrive, and it s becoming more and more critical that we continue to shut down white supremacy whenever we see it. These protesters did an amazing job in the face of hate, and hopefully Duke will be even just a little bit discouraged.Featured image Twitter and screenshot",News,"September 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Has Been Sued REPEATEDLY For Disabilities Violations At His Properties,"Throughout the past 19 years, Donald Trump has been sued no less than eight times for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act at his various properties, and has done his best to drag out these cases for as long as possible. In addition, a federal inspection at one of his properties also turned up multiple ADA violations.Five of the cases ended in a settlement and two others were resolved in consent decrees that required Trumpto make modifications to the properties to bring them into compliance with the ADA. One ended when both sides requested the case be dismissed and another was brought to a close in a bankruptcy.Christine Da Silva, a Trump Hotels spokeswoman, claims that Trump works very hard and spends lots of money to make sure his buildings are accessible to people with disabilities. It is the policy at all of our properties to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. This handful of cases, many of which are over ten years old, are not representative of our organization s strong record of ADA compliance. However, that  handful of cases  is pretty damning and doesn t support Trump s claims.In a suit filed in 1997, James Conlon, who is paraplegic, filed a lawsuit against Trump s Atlantic City Plaza Hotel alleging basic and serious deficiencies in accessibility. He stayed at the hotel and although he was placed in a room that was supposedly accessible, the toilets and showers were not usable by someone in a wheelchair. As for the public restrooms, they were so inaccessible he had to ask for help from strangers to be able to use them at all. A year later, Trump settled the case and agreed to renovate the accessible guest rooms and public restrooms, bringing them into compliance with the ADA. But a year later, Trump admitted to a judge that the renovations had yet to be completed.In 2001, a suit was brought by Robert Levine and Frieda Zames, who are both wheelchair users. They alleged that Trump International kept the wheelchair lift locked and when employees finally managed to locate the key, they had no idea how to use it. Levine said the degrading incident made him feel like a  second-class citizen.  Zames said it was as if  she were a  grade school child asking permission to go to the restroom.  In an attempt to shift the responsibility, Trump blamed the architects. The case was  amicably settled  in 2009 after both sides decided to dismiss the case.In 2003, Conlon filed suit against Trump once again, this time alleging the bus between New York and the Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino was only accessible to wheelchair users if notice was given at least a week in advance. Naturally, Trump sued the bus company and said it was all their fault, but he eventually settled the case.In 2004,  a disabled Purple Heart veteran filed suit against the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York, alleging the property was not equipped with adequately accessible emergency exits, guest rooms and restrooms. Trump did everything he could to get rid of the suit, besides just making his hotel accessible to people with disabilities, that is. He attempted to have the case dismissed and dragged it out for three years. Just like in 2004, Trump blamed the architects and even launched a countersuit, which a judge called bullsh*t on and dismissed.Helena Berger, the president and CEO of the nonprofit American Association of People with Disabilities, said Trump s relentless attempts to squirm his way out of the suit were  appalling. What was so striking and frankly appalling was the way he tried to fight [the violations].,  Berger said.  That, I think, is really telling. The Plaza Hotel became the subject of another complaint in 2007, which the plaintiffs eventually agreed to dismiss. Yet another lawsuit was brought against the hotel in 2008 but came to an end when Trump s company declared bankruptcy in 2009.In 2011, the Trump Taj Mahal settled with the Department of Justice after an inspection by the U.S. Attorney s Office turned up a long list of ADA violations. And more recently, in 2014, Trump claimed that making the pool at the Trump National Doral Miami golf course would impose an undue burden.  Four months after the suit was filed, Trump and the plaintiffs entered into a consent decree.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"September 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Bill Maher Deliver The Hard Truth So Many Republicans Just Don’t Want To Hear (VIDEO),"Win or lose, the fact that Donald Trump was able to win the Republican presidential primary says a lot about the future of the GOP. As much as many Republicans don t want to admit it, they ve allowed their party to slip into the hands of the extreme far right, and at this point, there s really no turning back.Appearing on Real Time with Bill Maher, Former Mitt Romney adviser Lanhee Chen explained that there are Republicans, like Romney, you seek to right the ship, so to speak. He said: After this election, the Republican Party does have some soul-searching to do. But to say that it is permanently changed implies that I think [Trump] will have some permanent influence on how we think about the world, and I think, from the perspective of someone who hopes that isn t true   I hope that isn t true. However, Maher pointed out that the problem isn t so much coming from within the establishment of the Republican party, but rather from the voting base it s been so desperate to attract to gain power. Maher said: I mean they didn t want Trump, a lot of them. And we see a lot of these Vichy Republicans who go along because they don t want to upset the apple cart. They know better. They know where their bread is buttered, where their voters are. But you can get rid of the Trump, you can t get rid of the voter. That s who they want. Then when Chen desperately tries to say that all they need to do is reach out to more people and attract new voters, Maher said: That s not what the base wants. The base is deplorable. The current GOP base, the base that elected Trump to be its party s nominee, wants it to be the white power organization that it has drifted into becoming. The Republican Party had the chance to oust the far-right crazy mindset, but they allowed a circus of a primary with 17 candidates. Which then led to a small majority gaining behind Trump while all the other votes were dispersed. They should have unified behind a solid candidate and Trump wouldn t have stood a chance. Talking about outreach now is way too little too late. The Republican party, as it was, is over, especially if Trump wins in November.Watch the full segment here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Major Newspaper Breaks 100 Year Tradition With 2016 Endorsement,"The Cincinnati Enquirer has endorsed Republicans for president for nearly a century but Donald Trump forced the paper to break the streak..Despite having reservations about Hillary Clinton, the longtime newspaper could not justify supporting the Republican nominee this time around. Trump, despite all of his bluster about wanting to  make America great again,  has exploited and expanded our internal divisions,  the Enquirer noted.The Enquirer has supported Republicans for president for almost a century   a tradition this editorial board doesn t take lightly. But this is not a traditional race, and these are not traditional times. Our country needs calm, thoughtful leadership to deal with the challenges we face at home and abroad. We need a leader who will bring out the best in all Americans, not the worst.That s why there is only one choice when we elect a president in November: Hillary Clinton.The Enquirer pointed out that Clinton has worked on both sides of the aisle to craft bipartisan legislation and has the experience necessary to be a good president in both domestic and foreign affairs. Furthermore, the Enquirer appreciates that her campaign is inclusive, noting that she has fought for LGBT rights and supports income equality for women.Trump, however, only represents national ruin and embarrassment.Trump is a clear and present danger to our country. He has no history of governance that should engender any confidence from voters. Trump has no foreign policy experience, and the fact that he doesn t recognize it   instead insisting that,  I know more about ISIS than the generals do    is even more troubling. His wild threats to blow Iranian ships out of the water if they make rude gestures at U.S. ships is just the type of reckless, cowboy diplomacy Americans should fear from a Trump presidency. Clinton has been criticized as being hawkish but has shown a measured approach to the world s problems. Do we really want someone in charge of our military and nuclear codes who has an impulse control problem? The fact that so many top military and national security officials are not supporting Trump speaks volumes.The Enquirer also noted that Trump is aligned with white supremacists and has filed bankruptcy multiple times, which defeats the notion that he is a successful businessman.In the end, there is only one real choice for president in 2016, and the Enquirer bucked a 100 year tradition and picked Hillary Clinton.In these uncertain times, America needs a brave leader, not bravado. Real solutions, not paper-thin promises. A clear eye toward the future, not a cynical appeal to the good old days.Hillary Clinton has her faults, certainly, but she has spent a lifetime working to improve the lives of Americans both inside and outside of Washington. It s time to elect the first female U.S. president   not because she s a woman, but because she s hands-down the most qualified choice.This endorsement is particularly important because Ohio is a swing state that will likely be a close call this November. A newspaper endorsement like this one could help many voters make up their minds and could even change enough minds to make a difference. The fact that this newspaper endorsed a Democratic nominee for the first time in about a century is, in the words of Joe Biden, a  big f*cking deal.

 GOP Sent Armed Agents To Harass Clinton Aide And Used Your Tax Dollars To Do It,"Republicans in Congress used tax dollars to send armed agents to harass a former aide to Secretary Hillary Clinton as part of the never-ending fishing expedition into Clinton s emails.Bryan Pagliano was a tech aide who helped to set up the server for Clinton s emails, and has made top Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee angry because he is asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refuses to testify.It is unclear why they need his testimony. The FBI and Department of Justice have already determined that Clinton s use of the email server does not warrant prosecution.But Republicans on the committee decided to flex their muscle anyways:But when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee subpoenaed Pagliano last week, his lawyers said he would again assert his Fifth Amendment rights. They added that he was willing to meet with the committee in private to make that assertion, but was unwilling to do so under the glare of television cameras in a public event.That prompted Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) to dispatch the armed marshals with a fresh subpoena last Friday, Chaffetz revealed in Thursday s hearing. To clear up any ambiguity created by Mr. Pagliano s six lawyers about whether they would confirm service of the prior subpoenas   which they refused to do   we had the U.S. marshals personally serve him,  Chaffetz said.The political stunt was slammed by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) who said,  This served no purpose but to harass and intimidate Mr. Pagliano. The chairman ordered this action in secret, without even notifying Democratic committee members of his plan.  No consultation, no debate, no vote. Republicans have sought to use their control of congress as a government funded super PAC to attack Clinton. In addition to her emails, Republicans have created multiple committees investigating the attack on U.S. personnel in Benghazi. All of these committees have cleared Clinton and President Obama of wrongdoing, but the GOP leadership insists on wasting more and more money on these cases.And it is all financed by taxpayers.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sarah Palin Celebrates After White Man Who Pulled Gun On Black Protesters Goes Unpunished (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin, one of the nigh-innumerable  deplorables  in Donald Trump s  basket,  almost outdid herself in terms of horribleness on Friday. I know, I know, it seems impossible   but it s true. Palin posted a link to an article on Facebook that shows a white man pulling a gun on peaceful African-American protesters in Charlotte only to get away with it. They re not protestors, they re rioters  and this changed some things!  Palin wrote triumphantly.The driver, a white man likely suffering from an affliction that causes his penis to not only be tiny, but inverted, decides to show the protesters what a badass he is by pulling a handgun on the crowd and holding it out the window of the vehicle.  Protesters begin to yell  he has a gun,  and the man can be sween violently swinging the door of his vehicle open as though he intended to attack the crowd. Eventually law enforcement takes notice. An officer walks over to the nice ammosexual s car, they have a nice friendly chat, and the man is allowed to leave without a single charge  despite the fact that it is illegal in North Carolina to brandish a firearm  or bring a gun to a protest. In fact, it is illegal to keep a handgun under the front seat or in an unlocked glove compartment, or concealed without a permit (we do not know if the man had a permit or not, but pulling a gun on peaceful protesters is against the law regardless). You may not carry a weapon at a parade, funeral procession, picket line, or other demonstration, except for guns carried on a rack in a pickup truck,  state law decrees.  You may not carry a weapon during civil disorder, riot, or other disturbance involving three or more people. White dude drives into crowd of peaceful protesters, draws gun, allowed to drive away alive. With my own eyes,  Heather Head, who filmed the video, writes on Twitter. Though the usual conservative bunch jumped on Twitter to claim the man was black, Head pointed out that she had a first-hand view of the gentleman with a gun, and  he looks pretty white bread to me. Yes, he broke the law and was allowed to escape without learning a single thing from his actions via some form of punishment, but to Palin s followers he s a hero:        Notice the language:  animals.   Savages.   They should all be shot.  Hillary Clinton was exactly right   these people are a  basket of deplorables,  or a billion more appropriate, less nice, terms. Each and every one of these Trumpaholics will be voting in November. Make sure you re out there too.Watch it below:Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Brilliant Facebook Post Puts Idiocy And Hypocrisy Of ‘All Lives Matter’ Into Razor-Sharp Focus,"Nobody shouted  all lives matter  until people started saying,  black lives matter.  There s an easy, albeit disgusting, reason for that and it s because the  all lives matter  crowd is uncomfortable with actually focusing on massive social problems that they perpetuate. Also, the crowd that tends to shout  all lives matter,  is overwhelmingly, white, straight, cisgender, and Judeo-Christian.But  all lives matter  isn t racist, sexist, religion-phobic, transphobic, homophobic, or anything at all to this crowd.There s a Facebook post making the rounds that describes the hypocrisy of this white, straight, cis, Judeo-Christian crowd that s feeling left out because we say  black lives matter.  It s absolutely brilliant. It s so brilliant that it s easier to post it than it is to explain it.Image via FacebookAnd there is the hypocrisy in all its vile glory. Holloman s take on  all lives matter  is amazing. All lives do not matter. The only lives that matter to the  all lives matter  crowd are those of the straight, white, cis, Judeo-Christian crowd. They wouldn t know the meaning of the word  all  if it came up and spit fire in their faces.Explaining why  all lives matter  is such a terrible thing to say first takes convincing that particular crowd that there s even a problem. White people who like that phrase won t acknowledge there s a problem, as recent, blatant racism from various officials has demonstrated. So saying the black community is still oppressed, and floating statistics, telling stories, even getting first-hand accounts and testimonials to prove it, is a massive waste of time.These analogies might be a waste of time, too, but they explain it a little better:#AllLivesMatter is like I go to the Dr for a broken arm and he says  All Bones Matter  ok but right now let s take care of this broken one  Belac Micheal (@djsoap92) July 6, 2016saying #AllLivesMatter is like running through a cancer fundraiser & saying  THERE S OTHER DISEASES TOO  judes (@judychen_) July 8, 2016#AllLivesMatter is like someone tweeting  Pray for Nice  and I say  what about all the other cities in the world? They ve suffered too   Nomnso (@Nomnso_94) July 15, 2016Or, if these aren t enough, how about this? Your house is on fire and the fire department is pouring water on it, trying to put the fire out. Your neighbor, whose house isn t burning, comes over and says,  My house needs water too, hellooooo!! Why are we ignoring my house and focusing only on yours?!  What are you going to say?In short,  black lives matter  is calling attention to an emergency situation like the ones above. Black lives do not matter nearly as much as white lives, and it s a serious problem. But Holloman s post illustrates not just the ignorance and offensiveness of  all lives matter,  but it shines a very uncomfortable light on those who continue to utter that phrase.Holloman is right. They really don t know what  all  means.Featured image by Mark Makela/Getty Images",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Obama: Once I’m Gone From Office, The Gloves Come Off","As the first African-American President, Obama knows that white America wouldn t have tolerated him as an angry black man, which is much of the reason he seems to never go far enough for progressives, especially some African-American progressives like Cornel West. The presidency is far from Obama s final act, though. Once he s out of office, he said in an interview with Vanity Fair, he ll be speaking out a lot more and likely doing things that he can t do while in office.Obama sat down with presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin for the interview, which was published on Friday.The walls of the private dining room where the interview was conducted didn t have past presidents. Instead, there were pictures of black civil rights leaders like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Jr. and of John Lewis during the 1965 march on Selma. Still, though, Obama s role model is Abraham Lincoln. My particular passion for Lincoln, though, dates back from my earliest memories of politics. And we ve talked about this before that there s no one who I believe has ever captured the soul of America more profoundly than Abraham Lincoln has.Not just his biography, of somebody who genuinely rose from nothing, self-taught, striking out along the borders of our Great Frontier. Somebody who worked with his hands and then worked with his mind, and somehow became one of the greatest writers in the English language. And I think, most importantly, somebody who was able to see humanity clearly, see the fundamental contradictions of the American experiment clearly, and yet still remain hopeful and still remain full of humor, and still have a basic sympathy for the human condition, even in the midst of a terrible war and having to make terrible decisions. And having a forgiving spirit. While Obama seems to have loved his time in office, he does regret some of the  institutional constraints  that might limit him from being who he wants to be. On the other hand, there are things he feels he can only accomplish once outside of office: Having had this office has given me this incredible perch from which to see how the world works. The power of the office is unique and it is a humbling privilege. With that power, however, also comes a whole host of institutional constraints. There are things I cannot say. There are things   that I cannot say, not out of any political concerns, but out of prudential concerns of the office. There are institutional obligations I have to carry out that are important for a president of the United States to carry out, but may not always align with what I think would move the ball down the field on the issues that I care most deeply about. Ex-President role models couldn t be any different. Perhaps the most respected post presidency, at least in modern times, would have to be Jimmy Carter s. He s dedicated his life to building homes for those who most need them and to social justice around the world. Bill Clinton has the Clinton Foundation, and the Bushes and Reagan, well, they retired into near obscurity.Obama is still young, though, at just 55. He will potentially have decades to finish his community organizing, only on a grander scale, or really, whatever he wants to do. You can be sure that no matter what he does, he will be working to try to make lives better for his fellow African-Americans, an in turn, his fellow Americans.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.

 Louisiana Cop Claims Murdering A 6-Year Old Child Was Self-Defense,"A Louisiana deputy city marshal is in hot water after body cam footage revealed him shooting at a suspect who had his hands up in the air. This is, sadly, becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair-trigger fingers grows. What makes this story sadly and horrifically unique, though, is that Deputy Derrick Stafford also shot and killed the suspect s six-year old son.And Stafford is claiming self-defense for that, because of course he is: Stafford, out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers, began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by [Christopher] Few which would put the officers in imminent danger. Officers went after Christopher Few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting. They claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down Few, whose six-year old son, Jeremy, was in the front passenger seat.18 rounds were fired although Few had his hands up, but no firearm was found in the car, and Few and Jeremy were both shot while still in the car. Stafford and his partner, Norris Greenhouse, said that after Few drove forward and then backed up, they were in fear for their lives, so they fired.That s always the story, though. It makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later, claiming they were in fear for their lives when it s obvious that their suspects were unarmed, and even had their hands in the air.Reports claim that neither Stafford nor Greenhouse knew Jeremy was in the car when they opened fire. Few was critically wounded, and Jeremy, who was autistic, non-verbal and in a special-needs first-grade class, was murdered.Stafford s plea of  self-defense  is a huge middle finger to Few and the rest of Jeremy s grieving family. Arguments will be heard in court next week, where Judge William Bennett will decide whether the indictments stand.Featured image via Louisiana State Police Facebook page",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 U.N. Report: Police Killings Of Black Men In U.S. Is ‘Human Rights Crisis’ Reminiscent Of Lynching,"The epidemic of black men being killed at the hands of police officers in America has not gone unnoticed on the international stage. According to aAccording to a report by a United Nations working group, which will be debated at the U.N. Human Rights Council on Monday, this situation constitutes a full-blown  human rights crisis  that is reminiscent of the days of lynchings. Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching,  said the report by the U.N. Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent.The U.N. report draws a stark comparison between modern day fatal shootings at the hands of law enforcement and the lynchings of blacks that swept the nation in the 19th and 20th centuries. The report comes as racial tensions in America have boiled over yet again in the wake of more deadly shootings that have rocked the country.Historically, the majority of African Americans killed in lynchings were hanged. The Equal Justice Initiative released a report in 2015 which said that between 1877 and 1950, an estimated 3,959 black people were murdered in  racial terror lynchings  throughout the country s southern states.The U.N. report follows a January visit to the U.S. by a five-member group, which was chaired by Filipino law professor Ricardo A. Sunga III. The group says that despite efforts at reform, they still remain extremely concerned  about the  human rights crisis  facing blacks living in the U.S., and this is especially true considering protesters are once again flooding the streets of American cities to protest the killings of still more black men in recent days. In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent. Impunity for State violence has resulted in the current human rights crisis and must be addressed as a matter of urgency. The experts  group pointed out that these killings go unpunished because the investigation is biased and tainted from the beginning since police departments are investigating their own. Adding to this is the fact that prosecutors have discretion when it comes to presenting charges and U.S. law enforcement officers are not held to international standards for use of force.To address the situation, they recommended that the U.S. institute a system to reliably track police killings nationwide and instances of excessive use of force. They also said that racial profiling must be brought to an end, which is  a rampant practice and seriously damages the trust between African-Americans and law enforcement officials. The group also said that improving race relations will also require education that must be  accompanied by acts of reconciliation  in order to successfully overcome the bigotry that plagues the U.S. and the past injustices that have been perpetrated against black people on American soil. The report added that the lasting negative effects caused by enslavement and racial injustice must be recognized by both federal and state laws.Featured image via video screen captures",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ANOTHER Trump Adviser Under Investigation For Russian Ties,"It s no secret that Russia is very pro-Donald Trump, and Donald Trump is extremely pro-Russia. His policies align with Russia s Christmas list, and he hired   for a campaign manager   a man who benefited heavily from pro-Russian monies during the Ukrainian conflict. In fact, the ties between Paul Manafort and Russian oligarchs became so widely known that it caused his premature departure from the campaign, prompting many questions to be raised.The Trump campaign thought this would all be behind them in no time.But, as usual, they were wrong.On Friday, it was a announced that U.S. intelligence officials are investigating Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Trump, for alleged ties to Russia. Intelligence officials have reason to believe that Page has opened up secret and backroom communications with top Russian officials in an ongoing effort to have economic sanctions lifted.According to Yahoo News, which first broke the story:The activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and  high ranking sanctioned individuals  in Moscow over the summer as evidence of  significant and disturbing ties  between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.The reports apparently had some members of Congress  taken aback,  due to the overwhelming and disturbing evidence that shows these ties. Congressional members, which includes California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, fear that such ties could lead to an unfair tampering with not only U.S.-Russian relations, but undercut foreign policy and even the November presidential election.Page is a former banker who worked for Merrill Lynch and is based in Moscow, giving him strong ties with rich and influential Russian officials. In fact, one of Page s business buddies is especially problematic for American diplomacy and international law:But U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft, Russian s leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russia s  illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine.So now that that the Trump campaign is once again under the microscope for shady Russian ties, they did what they know best: they lied. Page has been listed as a foreign policy adviser to Trump since March. In August, Hope Hicks, spokeswoman for the campaign, confirmed that Carter was an adviser. Now? Communications director Jason Miller told The Hill that Page is  not an adviser and has made no contribution to the campaign. So which is it? The campaign and its spokeswoman have confirmed that Page is in fact an adviser, and now their communications director says he s not nor has he ever been.It s becoming clearer and clearer everyday that the Trump campaign is nothing more than a puppet of the Kremlin and Putin s rich, thuggish buddies. But no, let s continue to talk about Hillary Clinton s pneumonia, because that s way more important than a potentially stolen election by the same people supporting one of the candidates.Featured image via Mark Makaela/Getty Images",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Early Voting In North Carolina Shows GREAT NEWS For Democrats,"Early voting has begun in the battleground state of North Carolina, and after months of contentious litigation, it s clear why Republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing Democrats with an eight point advantage over Republicans.Data analysis from TargetSmart (who partnered with NBC News) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from Libertarians.Contrast that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won North Carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, Republicans held a five percent lead. Now Democrats hold an eight percent lead. In 2008, when President Obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), Democrats had an 11 point advantage. In 2004, Democrats had an 11 point advantage, but Kerry lost to Bush by 13 percent.So while it s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case.Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 43 percent chance of winning North Carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). Clinton s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for Democrats in early voting. The New York Times  election model gives Clinton a 48 percent chance of winning North Carolina.Again, no wonder Governor Pat McCory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the GOP legislature wanted to do away with it. When Democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in November.Democrats shouldn t get too comfortable. Although early voting points to a Democratic-leaning result, Republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on November 8. President Obama never overcame Romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of September favored Obama.With 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so Democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for November 8.Rachel Maddow broke down the facts on her show:Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Eric Trump Gets Called Out On Fox News For Claiming His Dad Started With Nothing,"Eric Trump tried to spin a tale on Fox news about how his father started with nothing to build a business empire, only to be smacked down with a reminder that Donald Trump started out as a millionaire.The Republican nominee s demon spawn appeared on Outnumbered on Friday and attempted to portray his dad as just a normal guy who started with nothing in his journey to live the American dream.After trashing Hillary Clinton as not being relatable to millennial voters, Eric Trump was asked to explain how his father is relatable to them. And his answer was an effort to rewrite the reality of his dad s life. He s built an amazing company. He s become the epitome of the American dream.  Eric Trump said.  He s gone from practically nothing to a man who s just But that was a total lie and Julie Roginsky didn t let the younger Trump get away with it.Roginsky cut Eric Trump off and reminded him that his father got $1 million from his father Fred Trump to start out with.Nothing?  Roginsky said.  He got a million bucks. Come on, Eric. Indeed, Donald Trump grew up the son of one of the richest men in America. He has never known poverty in his entire life. In 1978, he was given $1 million by his father, an amount that Trump called a  small loan  moments after he claimed that life  hasn t been easy for me  during a town hall event in October 2015.Of course, that s an insult to the millions of Americans who live in poverty daily and can t even get a real small loan to lift themselves out of it. They struggle to put food on the table and to pay the bills, but Donald Trump had everything he could ever want and all the opportunities money could buy. Trump s dad also started a million dollar trust fund for him and left him a multi-million dollar inheritance when he died. In other words, Donald Trump knows absolutely NOTHING about starting from nothing.But Eric Trump didn t address Roginsky s reminder and just continued trying to sell his dad as a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps. He epitomized what America s all about: Opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?  Eric Trump continued.  It s no different than a Zuckerberg, right, who went out with a great idea like a Facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. That is achieving something, right? And I think it s very different than a person who has been a career politician. Here s the video via VidMe.Can no member of Trump s family actually refrain from lying about their past?Because it s clear that Donald Trump and his children do not understand what it is like to grow up poor. They have had everything given to them on a golden platter and they ve never had to work a real job a day in their lives. But for some reason, they think $1 million is the definition of starting with nothing.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt s infamous line,  we have nothing to fear but fear itself,  the Pope chastised fear-based media.Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of  terrorism  and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday.Spreading rumors is an example of  terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue , he said.  This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon. Source: ReutersNow, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that s what has given us Donald Trump.Crime in the nation is down. An American s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant.Source: The AtlanticSure, that s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they ve succeeded.Featured image via Franco Origlia/Getty Images.",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump-Supporting GOP Rep Calls Veterans ‘Moochers’ During Town Hall Event In Ohio,"If Republicans and Donald Trump really care about our military veterans, they will tell this douchebag to shut the hell up.Ohio GOP Rep. Warren Davidson has outraged the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the House Veterans Affairs Committee by referring to veterans as  moochers  who are just pretending to be hurt or sick when they show up to get medical care from the VA. Just like workers comp out here s got moochers, I wish that there were no vets that were the same sort of problem on our society,  Davidson said during a town hall event on Monday.  But part of the problem is there are some vets that are moochers and they re clogging up the system, and we do as taxpayers want to make sure the VA filters out these folks that are pretenders. Just like we wish there were no people out there with stolen valor, but that s a problem in the vet community, too. Davidson, who won a special election to replace John Boehner and is a supporter of Donald Trump, has drawn a shitstorm of criticism ever since.Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis slammed Davidson for insulting the men and women who have served this country. Honorably discharged veterans with service-connected wounds, illnesses and injuries, or who are indigent due to circumstances beyond their control, are not moochers,  he said in a statement.House Veterans Affairs Committee chairman Jeff Miller said he hopes that Davidson merely  misspoke  and called upon him to clarify his remarks.And Davidson s remarks are particularly outrageous because Davidson is a veteran himself.But when given the chance to back down, Davidson did the opposite.  Any effort to suggest I have anything other than a soldier s passion for providing our veterans with the care they deserve is dishonest,  he said before his spokesman presented four case of VA fraud to somehow prove his claims that veterans are  moochers. The problem is that these cases involve people who pretend to be veterans. In other words, the people in these cases are NOT veterans. But Davidson called veterans  moochers  anyway.It would have been so simple for Davidson to just clarify his remarks, but he didn t because, like Donald Trump, Republicans are incapable of admitting when they are wrong. So Davidson s insult of veterans stands in the record as a testament to how Republicans really feel about the men and women who fought for our country.Featured image via YouTube ",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Kieth Scott’s Wife Drops Mic On Cops, Gives Video Of Husband’s Final Moments To Press","What you are about to see is disturbing. Keith Lamont Scott, the man killed by police in Charlotte, North Carolina had an awesome wife of 20 years who narrated and recorded the final tragic moments of his life. Mr. Scott suffered from a traumatic brain injury, and his wife repeatedly told the police this information in the minutes prior to the shooting. She also told them that he had no weapon, and that he had just taken his medication. Of course, the cops just kept shouting at the man to drop the gun that he didn t have, before taking his life for no reason.Well, the cat s out of the bag now. NBC News has the video, so, despite the fact that the cops and the City of Charlotte have been refusing to take the public s demands for transparency seriously, the information is now out there thanks to the bravery of Mrs. Scott. Here is the news report, via NBC:These cops have a whole hell of a lot of explaining to do on this one. They better release whatever information they have, and they better not try any funny business with cover-ups. This is a damning, disturbing, and heartbreaking video of yet another senseless death of a black man in America at the hands of the system that is supposed to serve and protect.At this point, there is just absolutely no reason to trust the police, period. They are clearly killing people with impunity and without consequence. The public is aware now, so somebody better be held accountable, or there will continue to be unrest, and more matches thrown on a powder keg that is surely soon to blow sky high.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservatives Throw A Hissy Fit Because Michelle Obama Talked About Slavery At Black History Museum,"If you want to watch a conservative throw a temper tantrum just mention slavery and grab your popcorn.Because when First Lady Michelle Obama talked about slavery and the great progress our country has made since the Civil War during an interview at the new Smithsonian Institution s National Museum of African American History and Culture, conservatives took to Twitter to whine.Mrs. Obama told Good Morning America host Robin Roberts about how she feels about visiting the museum, which opens this weekend. And one of the things that struck her the most is the fact that a lot of the history the museum presents happened during the lives of the three generations of her family who visited the museum that day. And she expressed astonishment at how fast progress has been made. When you think about the fact that my great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House, that progress is huge and it s fast,  the First Lady said.Here s the video via Twitter.FLOTUS:  My great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House.

The two parties have flipped since then. Democrats have since become the defenders of Civil Rights who continue to fight for racial equality and social justice while Republicans pandered to white racists in the South and have become dominated by white supremacists who desperately want to roll back any and all progress African-Americans have made in this country.If Republicans have to go back 150 years to find one good thing the party did for African-Americans that s really embarrassing and says a lot about what the party has become.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: President Obama HAMMERS Trump For Claiming Black People Are Worse Off Today,"Donald Trump thinks African-Americans are worse off now than they have ever been, and President Obama just took him to the woodshed for it.During a rally, Trump declared that  African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape than they ve ever been in before. The assertion suggests that slavery was a picnic for black people and that Jim Crow was heaven on earth.But President Obama set Trump straight during an interview with Good Morning America at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. You know, I think even most 8-year-olds ll tell you that whole slavery thing wasn t very good for black people,  Obama told Robin Roberts.  Jim Crow wasn t very good for black people. What we have to do is use our history to propel us to make more progress in the future. Here s the video via ABC.President Obama also slammed those who think racism no longer exists in this country simply because he was elected to the presidency or because some black people make a lot of money. It s unrealistic to think that somehow that all just completely went away, because the Civil Rights Act was passed or because Oprah s making a lot of money or because I was elected president. You know, that s not how society works. And if you have hundreds of years of racial discrimination it s likely that the vestiges of that discrimination linger on. And we should acknowledge that and own that. As President Obama said, Donald Trump could learn a lot from a visit to this museum. To think that black people had it easy as slaves is offensive and it s almost as if Trump thinks they would be better off going back to being slaves. So he s definitely on a slippery slope, and while that may get his white supremacist supporters frothing at the mouth, it does nothing to help him get black people to vote for him.Featured Image: Jim Lo Scalzo-Pool/Getty Images",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Clinton Ad SLAMS Trump For His Disgusting Insults Towards Women And Their Bodies,"It s no wonder Trump is losing   and losing badly   with women. A new poll from McClatchy-Marist shows Clinton leading Trump by 24 points among registered female voters (58 percent to 34 percent), and 23 points among likely female voters. Remember, Mitt Romney lost the female vote by 11 points, and John McCain by 13 points.While the Trump campaign and his supporters scratch their heads as to why he s performing so poorly with the demographic that makes up the majority of the country, the Clinton campaign is reminding them why.A new (and brutal) ad has just been released from the Clinton camp. Asking voters if Trump is  the president we want for our daughters?  the ad, titled Mirrors, uses the Donald s deplorable, sexist, offensive and objectifying words against women against him. From,  I d look her right in that ugly face of hers,  to A person who s flat-chested is very hard for them to be a 10,  Mirrors showcases women all across the country looking at themselves   their bodies, appearance   at their phones, wondering if they are worthy, as Trump s disgusting words echo off the screen.When talking about Kim Kardashian, Trump thought it would be a good idea to talk about her famous asset:  Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely. So presidential.The most damning part comes at the end, when Howard Stern asks Trump,  So you treat women with respect? Trump s answer? No, I can t say that either. This ad is so powerful. Trump, who is well known to be a serial misogynist, sexist, and all around pig, should be ashamed of the way he regards women, their appearances, and livelihoods. No wonder his first wife cited  cruel and inhumane  treatment as the grounds for their divorce, and called him a  chauvinist  on TV.Little girls, and indeed little boys, are watching. Their parents have a choice: do we elect a man who has a proven track record of demeaning women he doesn t even know, or do we elect a woman who wants to tap everyone s potential, no matter who they are or what they look like.Watch the powerful ad that showcases just how much of a pig Donald Trump is:Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The King Of Anti-Hillary Trolling Is A Near Billionaire Whose Company Was Bought By Facebook,"If you ve spent much time on social media, you might notice that almost regardless of the subject, a string of anti-Hillary memes seems to just automatically show up. That s not a coincidence. It s all part of a highly coordinated  shitposting  designed by billionaire and Oculus founder, 24-year-old Palmer Luckey.Luckey is best known as a boy genius who invented his version of virtual reality goggles, called the Oculus Rift. Facebook bought Luckey s company in 2014 for $2 billion. Forbes estimates that he s worth about $700 million.The epicenter of his trolling seems to come from Reddit, where he uses the pseudonym  NimbleRichMan.  Luckey is a backer, likely the key backer of a pro-Trump 501(c)(4) charitable  social welfare  organization that s dedicated to backing Trump. If you think that sounds seriously sketchy, you d be right. According to the IRS, a 501(c)(4) is not supposed to have politics as its primary activity, and any politicking it does is not tax exempt. The Daily Beast published an expose on Thursday, which says in part:Nimble America says it s dedicated to proving that  shitposting is powerful and meme magic is real,  according to the company s introductory statement, and has taken credit for a billboard its founders say was posted outside of Pittsburgh with a cartoonishly large image of Clinton s face alongside the words  Too Big to Jail. We conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], now it s time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,  a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit.People on Reddit aren t happy. In fact, the biggest pro-Trump subreddit, r/The_Donald, refused to believe that Luckey was NimbleRichMan, but Luckey insisted that he s just the money behind the idea and well, he did it for a lark   because, you know, screwing with the future of the free world is fun! I ve got plenty of money,  Luckey added.  Money is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time. He prides himself on putting out memes that are so bad that even the Trump campaign wouldn t promote them.Before you think he s a Millennial who is still angry that Bernie Sanders didn t win, think again. He has zero problems with money in politics. The American Revolution was funded by wealthy individuals,  NimbleRichMan wrote on Saturday. Luckey confirmed to The Daily Beast he penned the posts under his Reddit pseudonym.  The same has been true of many movements for freedom in history. You can t fight the American elite without serious firepower. They will outspend you and destroy you by any and all means. Luckey isn t just spending money on anti-Hillary memes. He s spending money to support Trump.As an early supporter of @Oculus this makes me sick to my stomach. This is the org @PalmerLuckey is backing Cc @TechCrunch @UploadVR pic.twitter.com/athqtwol7e  Cody Brown (@CodyBrown) September 23, 2016This is a message from @PalmerLuckey, the founder of @Oculus. pic.twitter.com/CWlAA8ugMx  Cody Brown (@CodyBrown) September 23, 2016Luckey has apparently been banned from Twitter, but that doesn t mean that Nimble America, along with the backing of white supremacist and Breitbart propagandist, Milo Yiannopoulos. They plan on releasing more memes and purchasing billboards.It s not clear if Luckey has maintained any sort of relationship with Facebook or if he has pull with the organization. Let s hope not.

 NC GOP Rep. Makes Outrageously Racist Statement In Response To Charlotte Protests (VIDEO),"We are heading into yet another day of unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, and one GOP congressman is blaming the victims of systemic racism that lead to the deaths of so many black people at the hands of those sworn to serve and protect in the most blatantly racist way yet. North Carolina GOP Congressman Robert Pittenger had some extraordinary opinions to express here, but he swears he is not racist. Pittenger said that the protesters: The grievance in their minds, the animus, the anger. They hate white people because white people are successful and they re not. Yes, he actually said that. Here is video of the statement, via BBC NewsNight on Twitter:Protesters in #Charlotte ""hate white people""   North Carolina Congressman Pittenger tells #newsnight https://t.co/q6ELYD01QV  BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) September 22, 2016As if that weren t bad enough, Pittenger went on to say: We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, and we ve put people in bondage, so they can t be all they re capable of being. Of course, the backlash was swift, leading the fool who should never be allowed to hold any position of power whatsoever to quickly try and pretend that isn t what he really meant, that he isn t really a racist. He insisted that he is simply upset, that what is taking place in my hometown right now breaks my heart.  He also said, My anguish led me to respond to a reporter s question in a way that I regret. Pittenger, a die-hard Trumpkin, insists that he isn t racist eh? No, Rep. Pittenger, you ARE racist. Anyone who isn t would even think such a thing in response to these protests, much less say it. Face it   you re a racist. You and the rest of the GOP can whine and complain anytime someone calls you on your ignorance and bigotry all you want   we all know the truth, right from your own mouths.Those of us who are aware know the truth, even though you don t want to look in the mirror and see yourselves for what you are: flaming racists. Run along now, I m sure your sheet and hood are ready to be picked up from the dry cleaners.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Campaign Official Predicts The Future: ‘Bow Down To President Trump’ (VIDEO),"A member of Donald Trump s presidential campaign has creepy words about what could happen if her candidate becomes president of the United States. As part of a PBS Frontline special on the candidates, former Apprentice contestant and current Trump 2016 director of African-American outreach Omarasa Manigault said the key to the campaign was Trump s desire to see his political enemies on their knees:Omarosa Manigault, a contestant on  The Apprentice  who is director of African-American outreach for Trump s campaign, explains what she sees as Trump s motivations for running for president. Among them: resentments. Every critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump,  she says.  It s everyone who s ever doubted Donald, whoever disagreed, whoever challenged him   it is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe. In the video accompanying Manigault s comments, the night of the 2011 White House Correspondent s Association dinner is revisited, in which President Obama infamously roasted Donald Trump, who was in attendance. The President, riffing on Trump s promotion of the birther conspiracy theory, came at the reality TV star with his comedy guns blazing. Obama heaped joke after joke on Trump during the roast, and reports have indicated that Trump was seething but sitting stone-faced during the monologue.Some now believe that the episode embarrassed Trump so completely that he decided then to run for president as revenge for the humiliation.Regardless of whether that is true or not, history will record that as Obama was crushing Trump s spirit, he had already given the green light to the Navy s infamous Seal Team Six to go into Pakistan and capture or execute al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.As the Correspondent s Association audience laughed at Obama making fun of Trump, members of the U.S. Navy were in the process of killing one of the most wanted men in world history. And Obama never broke a sweat.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Good News Folks, God Is Now Protecting Donald Trump From A ‘Concentrated Satanic Attack’ (VIDEO)","Were you worried that Donald Trump might fall victim to a  concentrated Satanic attack?  Yeah? Well, you aren t alone. But good news folks, you don t have to worry about that anymore! God himself is now protecting the GOP nominee from the Dark Lord.On Wednesday, Trump attended the Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership conference in Cleveland. Trump-loving black man who lost his damn mind pastor Darrell Scott was worried that Satan might be after Trump too, which is ironic since most of us assumed the Republican nominee was working for the Prince of Darkness already.Scott claims that before Trump began is bid for the presidency, a nationally known  preacher warned him  that if you choose to run for president, there s going to be a concentrated Satanic attack against you. He said there s going to be a demon, principalities and powers, that are going to war against you on a level that you ve never seen before and I m watching it every day,  Scott said.Scott s wife, Belinda Scott, prayed over Trump as those around him laid hands on the bigoted billionaire, making sure Satan knew they were serious, dammit: God we ask you right now that Your choice is this choice. God, I ask that you would touch this man, Donald J. Trump,  she continued,  give him the anointing to lead this nation. Because what would Jesus do? Well, duh! He d make America great again. And naturally, he would use a racist demagogue to do it. (*Insert eye roll here.) Personally, I think they are a little late. At this point, they probably should have moved straight to an exorcism before his head starts spinning around.Watch Trump become immune to Satan, here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyRBtbC69V0]Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Literally Laughs In The Face Of Reporter Who Pushes Insane Health Conspiracies (VIDEO),"In case you have been living under a rock, we recently learned that Hillary Clinton is human through a series of reports about That One Time She Coughed and The Time She Got Pneumonia. Yes, somehow anytime Clinton gets the sniffles, the Right pounces on it, using anything and everything they can to push absolutely bonkers conspiracy theories about the former Secretary of State s health (she s on her deathbed, don tchaknow).During an interview with ACB s Sarina Fazan Wednesday, the reporter asked Clinton perhaps one of the dumbest f*cking questions she has been asked regarding her health: if she would undergo  neurocognitive tests  to appease inflated, only-existing-on-Trump s-side-of-the-aisle concerns about whether or not her presidency will be like a four-year-long edition of Weekend at Bernie s.Hillary just laughed in her face.  I m very sorry I got pneumonia, I m glad antibiotics took care of it, and that s behind us now,  the former Secretary of State said, somehow managing to avoid knocking the reporter for starting off by claiming 9/11 was  last week.  Clinton explained that her health meets and exceeds the standards anyone else running for office has met, but Fazan was all  so, ummmm, you gonna take those tests? There s no need for that,  Clinton said firmly, surely wondering how the f*ck this woman got hired in the first place.  The information is very clear. Hillary wasn t the only person laughing at Fazan, who also beat the dead horse that is the email  scandal.  Twitter lit up with people mocking the reporter for having the gall to waste time during an exclusive interview badgering the 2016 Democratic nominee about her health:@hannahfc and you are reporting this nonsense as if it is legitimate.

She was diagnosed with a  mild, non-contagious bacterial pneumonia,  was given antibiotics, and had to practically be tied down to keep her from rushing back out on the campaign trail because she has traditionally insisted on being f*cking Superwoman.What s next? Gonna ask her about Benghazi? Maybe she knows where Obama s real birth certificate is hidden. Could she have some inside information on a second gunman involved in the JFK assassination?

 Pence Says There Is ‘Too Much Talk’ About Racism In Policing And Institutional Bias,"While Charlotte, North Carolina faces a state of emergency and unarmed black people continue to get shot dead by police, Mike Pence has a few words to say regarding the mounting racial tensions gripping this nation. To him, it s annoying   but not in the way one might think.As black people   who have done nothing wrong that warranted getting killed   lie dead in the street, Pence and Trump are annoyed hearing about it. How do we know? Because Pence was *smart* enough to admit it to reporters:Trump and I believe there s been far too much talk about institutional bias and racism within law enforcement.Gee, sorry black people dying and being targeted at disproportionate rates annoys you so much, Pence. Sorry the plight of black America is a burden to your message of  Build that Wall. Thirty-eight percent of the U.S. population is non-white. When a third of the population can fall victim to institutional bias and racism in law enforcement, the conversation (or  talk  as Pence puts it) is extremely important. Sorry if the talk makes your uncomfortable or triggers your prejudices, but it needs to happen. Skirting it under the rug or blaming it on drug use doesn t make it go away.The statistics tell us all we need to know:So, even with all these glaring statistics, Mike Pence thinks talking about it has been  far too much  for his and Trump s comfort.Newsflash, Pence: you re running for Vice President of the United States, not Vice President of the white community. If the talk is too much, get out of the race.We already know Trump doesn t care about the black community nor does he want to actually fix anything that afflicts it, but Pence was supposed to give the illusion that a potential Trump Administration would care. That s been shattered.Good luck getting the black vote in November when you completely wish to disregard what hurts them the most: systemic racism.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"September 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Blames Charlotte Rioting On Drug Use, Without Any Proof","Another day, another racist dog whistle echoed by Donald Trump. While the urban unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina continues, Trump   in a pathetic attempt to sound presidential   blamed the rioting on drug use, without citing any facts to back up his claim.The comment, made in a speech in Pittsburgh, was off-script: If you re not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you re watching on television. Somehow, everyone but Donald Trump is unaware of the  factors  contributing to a legitimate unrest that stems not from drugs, but from the black community being continuously fed up with racial injustices and the murders of unarmed men who posed no credible threat to law enforcement.What Donald Trump is seeking to do is sow the seeds of a racist, stereotype that plagues this country: blacks are on drugs, and it makes them violent.The facts are out there: white people do more drugs, and serve less time. This notion that because black Americans are fed up with injustice is somehow attributed to drug use or a yearning for drugs is, yes, racist. It reaffirms people s ignorant and misguided stereotypes about urban black communities while simultaneously deflecting from other drug crises that are affecting white communities at much more critical levels.Recent findings in the American Journal of Public Health, the abuse and dependency on  hard drugs  are less common among delinquent African American youth than those who are non-Hispanic white.  White people, in general, are also more likely to deal drugs than black people. So the people selling drugs to our kids, parents, and members of the community are more likely to be white than black, but yet black people are still seen as the culprits of America s drug problem.And Donald Trump s claim, no matter how minuscule it may be, just makes the problem worse.Instead of accusing black Americans of being drug-induced degenerates, maybe Trump should travel up to New Hampshire and Maine, where an unprecedented opioid addiction is killing hundreds of white citizens every year, and nothing is being done to combat it.Donald Trump says the unrest in Charlotte would not happen in a Trump administration. Would New England s drug epidemic be stopped under his administration? Would the killing of unarmed black people   which is the only contribution to the unrest   stop in his administration? Would he end the dog whistle stereotypes that continue to blatantly fester in people s minds, regardless of what the facts are?Trump s going to get a huge wake up call with black voters in November if he keeps this up.Featured image via Sarah D.

 Hillary Clinton’s New Tax Plan Will Make Trump’s Kids FURIOUS,"Since the Reagan administration, Americans have been sold a bill of goods that tells us that inherited money is more valuable than earned money. Republicans would like all inherited money to be completely sheltered from any taxation, while for the most part, Democrats disagree. The compromise has been that only estates valued at a whopping $5.45 million or more ($10.9 million for married couples) are taxed. Anything below that is completely tax free.Now, Hillary Clinton, after prodding from Bernie Sanders and his followers, has revised her estate tax plan and trust me when I say Donald Trump s children won t be happy.Previously, Clinton said she would restore the tax on dead rich folks to its 2009 levels, pushing up the rate from 40 percent to 45 percent, and making it kick in for estates worth at least $3.5 million (today, it only hits those valued at $5.45 million or more). But, no longer. Instead, she s borrowed a page from her formal primary rival, and now proposes turning the levy into a progressive tax meaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estates with a top rate of 65 percent. The last time the estate tax hit that level was in 1982, though back then it also kicked in on smaller inheritances.Beyond all that, Clinton has said she would largely do away with the step-up in basis at death, a rule that allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that, say, their parents or uncle or other rich benefactor would have owed had they sold their stock before passing away.In the end, the committee expects these measures to raise about $225 billion over ten years.Source: SlateAs it stands, the estate tax system is a joke. In 2012, a staggering $1.2 trillion was passed down as an inheritance. Of that, less than 1 percent was taxed. As for the Republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses, in 2013, only 20 small businesses and family farm estates, in the entire country, had to pay estate taxes.The other common Republican argument is that estate taxes are  double taxation  (as if every other dollar in the American economy hasn t been taxed multiple times), but the reality is that most of what comprises large estates comes from capital gains, which are also unlikely to have every been taxed.Of course, even if Clinton is elected, she ll have a tough time passing this, at least as long as Paul Ryan is in charge of the House. He wants Trump s kids to pay zero in estate taxes. Of course, for all we know, Trump himself pays zero in taxes.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.",News,"September 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Seahawks’ Richard Sherman DROPS THE MIC On Those Who Ignore Police Brutality (VIDEO),"There s a lot being said about football players across the NFL standing together in unity against police brutality. This is even more pertinent now, as even more black men have been gunned down in the street just this week by police.Using his press conference to bring further awareness to this topic was none other than Seattle Seahawks  star cornerback Richard Sherman. He said: I m not going to answer any questions today, and it s no offense to you guys, but the state of things in the world today is very interesting. I think you have players that are trying to take a stand and be aware of social issues and try to make a stand and increase people s awareness and put a spotlight on it and they re being ignored. Whether they re taking a knee or whether they re locking arms, you know, they re trying to bring people together and united them for a cause. And I think that the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street and more videos have come out of guys getting killed, and I think people are still missing the point.The reason these guys are kneeling. The reason we re locking arms is to bring people together. To make people aware that this is not right. You know, it s not right for people to get killed in the street. Sherman then explains how he s been proactive in the community and even needing to go so far as to train young people of color on how to behave with the police, but still being fearful that they might get shot. He says,  that s an unfortunate time to be living.  Especially when people are being killed for no reason.He then has some choice words by those who are supposedly offended by those standing up against police brutality by quietly using their First Amendment right of dissent and protest to bring awareness to the plight. Sherman says: When a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it. You can say he s not being patriotic. He s not honoring the flag. I m doing none of those things. I m saying straight up, this is wrong and we need to do something. And something most certainly needs to be done, and done now.Watch Sherman speak here:Wow  this is a must-watch.Seattle Seahawks  Richard Sherman addresses police killings of African American men at presser, then walks out. pic.twitter.com/GOAOSgufAx  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 22, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Congressional Black Caucus Member Depicts List Of Things African Americans Can Be Killed For,"A senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus stepped up to a lectern on the House Floor on Thursday and listed all the innocent activities that can be a death sentence for African-Americans.Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), armed with a variety of props, depicted all the things that can cause black people in the United States to be killed at the hands of law enforcement because they are viewed with suspicion, even when engaging in harmless activities. Each time we lose a precious life to fear, distress, and prejudice, the list of things that will get you killed as a black person in America gets a little longer,  Lee said.Among the items she held up were: Should any of this warrant a death sentence? Is this the America you want to live in?  Lee asked.Lee said that when her sons were young she had  tough conversations  with them, warning them to be careful in their interactions with the very same police officers who are sworn to serve and protect them. Since Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson two years ago, 2,195 people have been killed by police in our nation. As the mother of two black men and the grandmother of five black grandchildren, I worry that someone I love could become number 2,196,  she said.The issue of fatal police shootings of African-Americans has come to the forefront again after three more killings rocked the nation. Tyre King, a teenager with a BB gun, was killed in Columbus, Ohio; Terence Crutcher, who had his hands in the air, was killed in Tulsa, Okla.; and Keith Lamont Scott, who was reading a book in his car, was killed in Charlotte, N.C. As a result, protesters have once again flooded onto the streets of America.Watch Rep. Barbara Lee address the House, here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoGdX5sFU2I]Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Campaign Chair Says Racism Didn’t Exist Before Obama – Promptly Resigns,"President Obama is right   it appears the people running the Trump campaign skipped their history and civics classes.After Donald Trump got a lashing from black activists after claiming it s  never been worse  for them than it is right now, one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly.Wrong.As usual, no one in the Trump campaign learns their lesson. And their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state.Trump s campaign chair in the prominent Mahoning County in Ohio, Kathy Miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people weren t successful in the last 50 years, it s their own fault. She also said there wasn t  any racism until Obama got elected  and skirted problems under the table:If you re black and you haven t been successful in the last 50 years, it s your own fault. You ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn t have. You had all the advantages and didn t take advantage of it. It s not our fault, certainly.Miller then doubled down, calling the Black Lives Matter movement a  stupid waste of time  and said low voter turnout in the African American community as due to  the way they re raised. What does  the way they re raised,  supposed to mean? Maybe Miller should take a look at the fact that the Trump kids didn t vote (and couldn t even vote for their dad) before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids.Miller resigned, gave a half-ass apology, and distanced herself from the campaign. Of course Trump s Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik stressed that Miller s comments were not reflective of the campaign, and reduced her position to that of a simple  volunteer  to steer away any influence she once held.Once again, the Trump campaign deflects, blames, and dodges responsibility. Oh, and it once again shows that it s being run by a bunch of entitled white racists.Featured image a screen-grab",News,"September 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process. There s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won t know the law, and they ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,  Gitlin said.  That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls. As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.And that s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants. We re going to watch Pennsylvania,  Trump declared during a rally in the state last month.  Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion   I really mean this, Pennsylvania   is if cheating goes on. Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to  Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election! In response to Trump s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.Featured Image: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",News,"September 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hannity Gets His A** Handed To Him For Falsely Claiming Terence Crutcher Has Violent Criminal Past,"Fox News host Sean Hannity desperately tried to smear Terence Crutcher on Wednesday as a violent criminal who was wanted by police but was repeatedly shut down by a local Tulsa news anchor.Crutcher was shot and killed by white police police officer Betty Shelby even though he had his hands up and was surrounded by other police officers. The murder was caught on camera.Clearly, the unarmed Crutcher was not a threat to the safety of the officers, especially when you consider the fact that police officers have consistently taken in armed white suspects alive without ever firing a shot at them.But Sean Hannity repeatedly claimed during his radio show that Crutcher had a violent criminal record and had warrants out for his arrest. I understand that in this particular case Mr Crutcher has a long criminal history and appeared to be under the influence or so the police are charging,  Hannity said, which prompted Tulsa news anchor Russell Mills to smack Hannity down with facts. Well I ll tell you I looked up his history and I m not seeing a lot of criminal history,  Mills replied.  We have something called the OSCN   the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network. I was able to find a protective order from 12 years ago that was dismissed. I found a couple of financial things. There s no violent criminal history for Mr. Crutcher that I ve been able to uncover. But Hannity didn t want to hear the truth so he moved on to claiming that Crutcher had several warrants out for his arrest.Mills informed Hannity that there were no such warrants.Hannity responded that he read somewhere that there were warrants. I have not seen any reporting on any warrants for Mr. Crutcher and I certainly haven t uncovered any myself,  Mills said.  There has been some misinformation floated. A disappointed Hannity resorted to claiming that he has a  source  within the department and said that  it s a matter of time of when they re gonna release this information. Here s the audio via Media Matters:Once again, Sean Hannity tries to demonize another black victim of a police shooting in order to make people believe the shooting was totally justified. The bottom line, however, is that Crutcher had his hands up and was surrounded by officers. He wasn t a threat to them or anyone else but they executed him anyway. Officer Betty Shelby should be arrested and charged with murder.

" 51 Companies Are Pledging Over $650 Million In Refugee Support, White House Announces","While Donald Trump Jr., Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, compares refugees to poisoned skittles, the CEOs, Presidents and other executives of 51 companies are coming together to pledge hundreds of millions of dollars to aid refugees all across the world, the White House has announced.Coming together to show solidarity and compassion while world leaders meet for the U.N. General Assembly session, the companies   which include Matercard, Facebook, Twitter, Johnson & Johnson, and yogurt maker Chobani   will use the money to promote, sustain and continue education, employment and financial services all across the world, and alleviate suffering to over 6 million refugees:Today, 51 U.S. companies   which represent more than 2.5 million employees, more than $775 billion in annual revenue, and more than $3.2 trillion in market capitalization  have stepped up and are standing with the Administration to demonstrate that private sector innovation and resources can make a difference and catalyze real solutions. Together, they have committed to investing, donating, and raising more than $650 million.The hefty pledge is just part of the White House s goal of $3 billion in humanitarian aid, and the announcement was made just as President Obama hosted a refugee summit with the leaders of Jordan, Mexico, Sweden, Germany, Canada and Ethiopia, countries that have taken in thousands of refugees from Syria and other war-torn states.While meeting with the company CEOs and George Clooney, President Obama thanked them for their  extraordinary gesture of compassion,  saying: I want to emphasize that from their perspective this isn t charity. This is part of their overall mission. It makes good business sense. Unlike Trump s businesses   in which hotel stays have plummeted   people like to be compassionate, see compassion, and act on it.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told world leaders and the company leaders,  Your compassion will really help these helpless people. If not us, who can do it? Certainly not Donald J. Trump, nor his spawn of selfish fear-mongers.The companies took to social media to express their support for President Obama s call to action:We believe in a world where you can #BelongAnywhere.

 Black Protester SHUTS DOWN Fox Reporter On Live TV For ‘F***ing Fabricated Story’ (VIDEO),"Last night, Fox News reporter Steve Harrigan was reporting live in Charlotte, North Carolina to cover  police brutality protests that had erupted after a shooting. Perhaps because Fox News has typically shamed these kinds of protests and ran footage that depicted protesters as thugs and looters in the past, Harrigan got his a** handed to him by a protester that didn t hesitate to confront the notoriously racist network.The female African American protester went right up to Harrigan and decided to educate him about why she and other protesters had gathered. When Harrigan tried to shame her for being outside in an area where someone had just gotten shot, the protester couldn t tolerate his ignorance and white privilege any longer. Harrigan made the mistake of asking her, If a man was shot about 50 yards over there, we don t know by who. Why are you here? And that was it. The protester went off, and replied to Harrigan, Because I serve a purpose  right before giving him a brutal lesson in racism. She forcefully said that no matter where she is, at any given moment she could be shot just because of the color of her skin. She said: I could be at work, at school, in my car, I can still get shot   by the police! Pointing out the fact that racism still exists in America, she continued: We are not the same. We are human, but I am black and you are white so don t tell me not to come over here Harrigan tried to jump in, but the protester quickly called him out for  using sarcasm as a crowd began to gather, and accused the network of only being at the protests so that they could get video footage and make a f*cking fabricated story    which we all know Fox News has done in the past.You can watch the protester shut down Fox News below:Featured image is a screenshot",News,"September 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Loses Support Of Police Union After Saying Tulsa Shooting Cop ‘Choked’ (VIDEO),"While giving a speech at a church rally in Cleveland, Donald Trump confused everyone by actually siding with a victim of police brutality instead of law enforcement   and it s gotten him in trouble with America s largest police union.In speaking to the rally goers in Cleveland, Trump strayed from his normal, pro-cop rhetoric to say a few unflattering words about Betty Shelby, the Tulsa police officer who shot an unarmed black man. Clearly worried about how horrendously his attempts to reach black voters have failed, Trump gave an unusually thoughtful response to a group of African American pastors, in which he suggested that Shelby had  choked : Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can t be doing what they re doing, okay? They can t be doing what they re doing.I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up. That man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. I mean, to me, it looked like he did everything you re supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man. Trump made these comments just five days after the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which has 330,000 members, endorsed him. But after hearing Trump criticize the Tulsa police officer, FOP executive director Jim Pasco is livid and thinks Trump s comments were inappropriate. Pasco said that Trump must be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all, including police officers. Now, no one should be proud or relieved that Trump finally decided to acknowledge police brutality victims   he s been known to pander to whatever audience he is in front of at any given moment, and is notorious for flip-flopping almost instantly. This speech was easy for Trump to say in front of black pastors   I doubt he would have dared to say this in front of a predominately white audience. Trump also knows he is struggling tremendously with the minority vote, which may very well determine this election. Trump will say whatever he needs to win   but this time, he lost a major support group.Here s the clip that got Trump in trouble with the police union:Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"September 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Dixie Chicks’ Natalie Maines Unleashes HILARIOUS Twitter Tirade Against Trump (TWEETS),"With this presidential election being as absolutely bizarre as it is, sometimes it s incredibly important to keep our sense of humor about us. One person who seems to being doing this very well is none other than Dixie Chicks  Natalie Maines.As a woman who s never shied away from letting her opinion be known about politicians, Maines began by taking to Twitter to make a joke about her apparent issues with airline travel saying that she ll vote for whoever makes the airline industry decent again. Although, she had one quick addendum to that statement: But only if it s a Clinton. At this point I might vote for whichever candidate promises to make the airline industry decent again.But only if it's Clinton?.  Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) September 22, 2016Then Maines went on to joke about the fact that not even George H.W. Bush can vote for Trump for president. Which for a Bush not to vote for a bad president to be in office is just utter irony.Even Bush won't vote for Trump!Which honestly has kind of turned my world around and forced me to rethink everything.#skiddin  Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) September 22, 2016She didn t stop there, however, in reply after reply, the jokes kept coming:@giannaL Oh no! Not at all! It's totally natural.For an Umpa Lumpa.  Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) September 22, 2016@DCXn24Fan OMG! That's even a better visual than him in a tanning bed. So presidential!

 Trump Calls For This Racist Policy To Be Forced On Every State,"Donald Trump is calling for one of the most controversial and racially charged policies enacted by police departments to be expanded across the entire country. The city of New York recently ended  stop and frisk,  but Trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. From Politico:In a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address  violence in the black community  and  black-on-black crime.  Trump responded by proposing that  stop-and-frisk  policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,  Trump told the questioner.Stop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management.When the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadn t done anything wrong.Former US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as  destructive  in an interview with Buzzfeed. She added: In short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.

" ‘Empire’ Takes On Racist Police Violence, Guns In America In Breathtaking New Song (VIDEO)","The season premiere of the hit television drama Empire features an amazing song performed by Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal on the show. The song, entitled  Need Freedom  has a very clear message: gun violence, senseless killings, and police brutality against people of color must stop, because our nation is ripping itself apart. Smollett says of the decisions that inspired him to record  Need Freedom : I recorded this exactly seven days after Philando Castile was shot. Between the shootings of Castile, Alton Sterling, at the Pulse in Orlando and the police officers in Dallas   not to mention the other numerous killings over the last couple of years   it was like we couldn t breathe. What are we doing as a people, a nation; what messages are we sending to the next generation. Then this song came. Smollet is right, of course, and what better way to inspire people in an effort to draw peace in such a tense and violent time, where there is such anger, such division, such justified outrage, than by doing so in song? Here are just a few of the more inspiring lyrics from Smollet s song:As I sit and think about All that s goin  on My soul just cries out Can you tell me please?Tell me who s to blame For causing all this pain The one s we call to help us turn They kills us everyday See war is not the answer And love is what we need Take the chains off, break the bondage Set my people freeWe gotta make it better Something s gotta change The world needs your voice just to make it through the rain When I think of what s goin  on in this world Ohh it gets me to see my sister not breathe My sister, my brother here with meNeed freedom Our world is cryin , no more silence, with guns and violence Need freedom I can t keep dyin , we re way too quiet, no more silence Need freedom Stop this evil, free my people, we re all equal Need freedom Our world get s brighter, keep on tryin , keep on fightin  for freedomThese lyrics come on this night, September 21, as, at this very moment, protests are erupting in Charlotte, North Carolina, because yet another black man, Keith Lamont Scott, is dead at the hands of the police. Already, as per usual, the police are in front of cameras, in damage control mode, spinning the story they want the public to hear. Whether it is true matters not to them; they only want to cover their own asses, because black lives simply don t matter to them. This message is one that is definitely needed.It is, of course, a message that will likely fall on deaf ears. We live in a nation where people think that the right of every person to have as many guns as they like, anytime they like, no matter what, should supercede the rights of innocent people to live. These are the same people who think that cops can do no wrong, and that the bloodshed at their hands is always justified. These are same people who believe that freedom only applies to certain people, and to hell with everyone else. They re the people who think that every black man shot by police was just another  thug  anyway, and that the void left in the lives of his loved ones is of no importance.They re the same people who don t care about what happened in Orlando, or Oregon, or Newtown, or any of the other countless places where people who should have never had firearms carried out massacres. They only care about their guns and their rigid belief that whatever happened was worth their version of  freedom. Hopefully, the people who need to hear this message the most will, and the killing will stop. However, I sadly won t be able to hold my breath on that one. It will only continue another day, in another city after another innocent life is lost, or another unbelievably tragic and preventable massacre is carried out. Sadly, that is the America we live in today.Watch the video below:Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Stolen Valor: GOP Senator Disgracefully Lies, Makes Up Military Service","Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) has been caught red-handed lying about the details of his military service, and it isn t the first time he has done it. From The Huffington Post:CNN reported Wednesday that Kirk s campaign website erroneously stated that he is  a veteran of the Iraq War.  In reality, the senator stayed in the United States during the war as he served in the Navy Reserve.His campaign chalked it up to a staff error, saying that particular page on Kirk s website was not meant to be public and that staff members were making edits to it. Staff moved the page behind a password-protected firewall after CNN investigated.Kirk, who is up for re-election this year, has previously been caught in the middle of lies about his military career.He claimed in 2010 that he had been named  Intelligence Officer of the Year,  when the award was for work his entire unit had done. He also promoted a story alleging that his reconnaissance plane had come under fire, but there was no record of that. Kirk claimed that he had served in  combat  in Kosovo, but he didn t. He claimed he had been deployed to Afghanistan, but he had been sent there for training, not for combat service. He also previously falsely claimed to have been deployed to combat in Operation Desert Storm.Kirk s lies about his service would be a major issue at any time, but they are even more notable because he is facing a strong challenge from Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). Duckworth is an actual combat veteran who served in the Iraq War. In that conflict, Duckworth received a Purple Heart after her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. She is a double amputee after her severe injuries forced the removal of her right leg near the hip and her left leg below the knee.In polling averages, Duckworth is currently 7% ahead of Kirk.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Just Accidentally Admitted He Still Believes Obama Was Born In Kenya,"In an interview with a Toledo, Ohio news station, Donald Trump accidentally admitted that his  big  20-second announcement that Barack Obama was born in the United States,  period,  was just a ruse. Speaking to ABC6/FOX28, Trump seems to have again picked up the birther ball in a  wink and nod  fashion. This announcement earlier this week with you saying that you believe President Obama was in fact born in the United States, after all the years where you ve expressed some doubt, what changed?  interviewer Ben Garbarek asked, prompting Trump to explain that he caved because he didn t want to talk about it anymore   no other reason: Well I just wanted to get on with, I wanted to get on with the campaign. A lot of people were asking me questions. We want to talk about jobs. We want to talk about the military. We want to talk about ISIS and get rid of ISIS. We want to talk about bringing jobs back to this area because you ve been decimated so we just wanted to get back on the subject of jobs, military, taking care of our vets, etc. Yes, being able to  get on  with his campaign without being bothered by inconvenient questions about the five years he spent attempting to delegitimize the President by demanding his birth certificate, college transcripts and applications, and other documents he was sure would prove that Barry Soetoro (as the President is known in birther circles) is a Kenyan-born conman who managed to install himself as President through what we can only assume is magic.Sadly, this accidental admission that his views on the President s birthplace and eligibility for office had not changed one iota is perhaps the most honest thing Trump has said lately, with much of his attention being focused on defending the Trump Foundation s misuse of charitable funds to pay The Donald s personal legal fees, attacking African-American communities, and practically publicly masturbating over the recent attacks in New York and New Jersey.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab/Getty Images (Win McNamee)",News,"September 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Avengers’ Director Launches EPIC Celebrity-Filled Superhero Effort To DEFEAT Trump (VIDEO),"World-renowned writer/director Joss Whedon has returned to social media with a vengeance and a message that needs to be heard by everyone. Especially those who are apparently severely apathetic to the election this year.The Avengers director and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator knows all too well that we can t sit this election out and has recruited some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry to get his message out there.His Save the Day PAC is described as such: We are a short-form digital productions company dedicated to the idea that voting is a necessary and heroic act. That every voice in this wonderfully diverse nation should, and must, be heard. That the only thing that can save democracy is the act that defines it. We are committed to fighting the apathy, cynicism, and honest confusion that keeps citizens from using their vote. And to reminding an increasingly out-of-touch and compromised set of representatives that they are answerable to the people they were hired to serve. It s clear in the video that Donald Trump must be defeated for the good of all humanity, so it makes absolute sense that Whedon would use those who have played superheroes in his movies to get this very important message across.It s absolutely important that we all vote, not only for president, but also for legislators all the way down to the local level. This election defines not only who will lead the nation, but also who will sit on the Supreme Court, and as Whedon s video points out, it s a  tipping point  for the world.Sitting at home because you think both parties are equally as bad isn t only wrong, it s dangerous and allows that which we despise the most to gain power and control.Go here to visit Save the Day PAC, register to vote, and make sure your voice is heard.Watch the video here:Featured Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images",News,"September 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CNN Commentator DEVASTATES Trump Supporter Who Thinks Using The N-Word Is Great (VIDEO),"This should come as no surprise to most of us, but Trump supporter Don King let the  N-word  slip out during a recent speech in an Ohio Church. It s also unlikely that you ll be surprised at the fact that Trump was sitting right behind him, smiling with glee when it happened.Trump LOVED hearing the  N-word  (screenshot)CNN commentator Angela Rye spoke about this terrible incident with a Trump supporter, and the racism behind the Trump campaign got even worse. When Rye asked white Trump surrogate Joseph Borelli to  Please tell me that you understand  how offensive it was to use the  N-word  in 2016, she didn t quite get the answer she was hoping for. In fact, it was the exact opposite. The white panelist basically said that since rappers use the  N-word , it s fair game for Don King and everyone else. Borelli said: Have you not listened to music where other African-Americans use language far worse than this? Rye couldn t believe her ears, and gave Borelli a chance to save himself as she begged,  Please don t do that to me. Please don t do that to me, today. And of course, the dense Trump supporter didn t take the hint: I am going to do it, though. You can t say that Don King is saying a word that is now suddenly unacceptable. It s not one that I would use, but it s perhaps a word that Don King would use. That s when Rye went off and tore him a new one. In making her point, Rye warned,  What I m saying to you, is this trivializes your candidate s black outreach.

 WATCH: Jimmy Kimmel Demonstrates That Trump Could Support Child Rape And Not Lose Any Votes,"It s official. Trump s supporters will vote for Donald Trump no matter what he does or what lies he tells, even if his tax returns reveal the truth.During his show on Tuesday night, Jimmy Kimmel ran yet another  Lie Witness News  segment featuring Trump supporters being asked questions based on the false story of him finally releasing his tax returns.The Kimmel reporter on the street asked Trump fans what they think now that the tax returns reveal that Trump is close with Putin, leases his wife Melania, writes off gold-plated toilets as a business expense, and supports child molester Jared Fogle.As it turns out, every single Trump supporter said they are still voting for the Republican nominee no matter what, even if it is true that Trump contributed to the legal defense fund of a convicted child molester. In fact, his supporters made excuses for Trump in order to justify his actions.So when Donald Trump said that he could go out and shoot someone dead in broad daylight in the middle of Fifth Avenue and not lose any votes, he was right.Because Trump s supporters were not fazed by any of the claims presented to them. They were even okay with him lying on his returns by listing his occupation as a farmer.Seriously.Here s the video via YouTube.Trump s supporters are truly deplorable people who just want to watch the world burn.It doesn t matter what he says or what he does or how much he embarrasses America, Donald Trump s supporter will vote for him no matter what.So the question is will the rest of us sit home on Election Day and let the lunatics win? Or will we get our asses off the couch and make sure Donald Trump never sets a single toe inside the White House?Because if his supporters don t mind him doing all of these despicable things, that means Trump could basically do whatever he wants in office without political consequences and that would be disastrous for the nation.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Facing Tough Re-Election, Sheriff Joe Says He’s Still Investigating Obama’s Birth Certificate","Even though Donald Trump (sort of) dropped the  birther  issue, there s one pro-Trump surrogate who   in the tightest re-election fight of his life   is still pledging to continue his investigation into President Obama s birth certificate.Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was recently recommended for criminal court due to the continuation of racial profiling and perjury, told a group of Tea Party activists that he is certain Barack Obama s birth certificate is forged and will do everything he can to prove it: I m not going to give up, and we re looking into it. I don t know how it s going to turn out. I don t care where he s from. We are looking at a forged document. Period. I had nothing to do with Trump on the birth certificate. We did it on our own, because of you guys. The room of 200 or so activists were of course energized by Arpaio s pledge to unleash the  truth.  Before speaking to the crowd, Arpaio told reporters that it was the Tea Party activists in Maricopa County that got him  stuck  with the birther issue after World Net Daily, a right-wing publication known for conspiracy theories, had a reporter speak to another group, and subsequently gathered almost 250 signatures demanding Arpaio investigate. He complied, launching his investigation last week.According to Arizona Central:Mike Zullo, the lead investigator on the case and commander of Arpaio s Cold Case Posse, told the crowd that he knew Trump s statement was a  punch in the gut, because it was unexpected. Zullo said he thought Trump s statement was  strategic. It s not going to deter us,  Zullo said.  It s not going to stop us. I am closer than ever. Zullo also claims that a nurse who worked at the hospital where President Obama was born, the Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, denies that such a birth ever happened.Well there you have it. Not only are Maricopa County residents footing the bill for Arpaio s legal woes (yet again), they are now paying for another  investigation  into President Obama s birth certificate. Is this what Republicans mean by  fiscal responsibility? In Maricopa County, there are almost 4.2 million taxpaying citizens. And now they are paying their Sheriff s office their tax dollars to  investigate  some fringe conspiracy supported by 250 activists. Think about that.Maybe that s why Arpaio is losing his re-election bid to a Democrat, Paul Penzone, and it might also explain why his poll numbers are plummeting.Good thing he s focusing on the issues that matter.Featured image via Ralph Froso/Getty Images",News,"September 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Foreign Diplomats Scared Sh*tless Over The Idea Of A President Trump,"As we know, the final United Nations General Assembly of President Obama s presidency is occurring in New York City this week. That gave diplomats from around the world to weigh in on this year s very strange presidential election. Many seem rather rattled about the idea of a Donald Trump presidency, while others merely poked fun at Trump s buffoonery.One diplomat mocked Trump, saying,  he s a clown.  Another said,  He s nuts.  Yet another said that Trump is an  untrustworthy egomaniacal equivocator. Well, it s too bad so many American citizens can t see these traits in Trump. An Ipsos poll that polled foreign ambassadors who are currently working in America has 60 percent of these people saying they would vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton if they were citizens, while only 7 percent would hop on the Trump Train. That in and of itself is very telling.Dennis Jett, who spent much of his career being a diplomat himself and now works for Pennsylvania State University School of International Affairs, says that Trump s behavior has made many diplomats nervous and worried about American leadership, America s role in the world. Also curious is the fact that the American people have succumbed to the belief that Hillary is untrustworthy, while 93 percent of those surveyed in the Ipsos poll say that they find Hillary to be  somewhat  or  very much  in the realm of someone who they feel they can trust. On the other hand, just two in five of those surveyed say that they trust Trump  a little  while the rest said they don t trust him as far as they can throw him.German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier says that Trump is a  hate preacher  and alluded to the idea that the billionaire tycoon reminds him of demagogues from past times in his own homeland. French President Fran ois Hollande says that the GOP nominee s excesses make you want to retch. One lobbyist familiar with the diplomatic community says that there are deepening fears around the world regarding the idea of Trump making it to the White House. Speaking anonymously, the lobbyist said: Foreign clients are very concerned about what they perceive as a tipping point in this election. This is less about Democrat versus Republican, and more about open versus closed economy, vis- -vis the rest of the world. With a wave of nationalism and protectionism sweeping the West, there is a real concern it will take hold in the United States and in what form it might show itself post-election.Whether it s immigration reform or trade policy, it feels as if much of the world is opening while the U.S. is teetering on closing. Even more alarming, the diplomats say, is Trump s  America First  and isolationist demagoguery. Stephen Walt, who works as a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, says of the situation among diplomats: First and most obviously, most foreign governments would like a relatively predictable post-November situation, and I think they regard Trump correctly as a giant leap in the dark.Whatever Hillary Clinton s strengths or weaknesses might be, she has been a very conventional politician, at least when it comes to foreign policy. Therefore, people don t anticipate any kind of radical turn if she s elected. Of course, another source of more than a little concern is Trump s penchant for starting public feuds with longtime allies of the United States, as well as his public musings that he might not honor alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)   which is the single most important military alliance that we have developed since the horrors of World War II.In other words, the entire world is afraid of Donald Trump. Why aren t the American people able to see how dangerous this demagogue is? Donald Trump could single-handedly destroy the world with the power of the presidency.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"September 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Racist Swarm Fox News In Response To Protests In Charlotte And Their Comments Are Deplorable,"Police say Keith Lamont Scott had a gun. Scott s family says he was just reading a book.But it doesn t matter what the facts are, racists are not only happy that another black man is dead, but theyalso want police to kill all of the people protesting the shooting.Protests broke out in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday night and, as usual, Fox News went to great lengths to portray the protest as a full scale riot and that sent racists into a hateful frenzy on Twitter.FOX NEWS ALERT: At least 12 Charlotte officers injured in latest anti-police protests (via @HuntsmanAbby) pic.twitter.com/TW0wmvSSNM  FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) September 21, 2016And here are some of the worst remarks. @foxandfriends @HuntsmanAbby anti police protests is what u call it ?

 Trump Campaign Gives PATHETIC Reason Why George H.W. Bush Is Voting For Hillary (VIDEO),"Months ago, former First Lady Laura Bush shocked Americans when she said she d rather vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton than a Republican this election. For the most part, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush have opted to stay out of this election   until now.Word of George H.W. Bush s decision to snub the GOP by not voting for its disastrous Republican nominee just recently broke, and it s a super provocative move because not only is Bush refusing to support his party, but he is voting for the Democratic Party instead. It s a controversial decision, but obviously Bush recognizes that it s the smartest choice for the future of this country.The Trump campaign, as you can imagine, isn t taking this lightly. In an interview with CNN s Erin Burnett, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reacted to the elder Bush s voting decision and couldn t have demonstrated any better how immature and bitter the campaign was about it.Conway said that although she  respects  Bush s choice, it s ironic that he s voting for the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race  in 1992. Conway also chalked up Bush s decision to vote for Clinton to his emotions and  hurt feelings  over his son s loss to Trump in the primaries. She said: This was a bruising primary, and Jeb Bush really failed all expectations  I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there. You can watch the interview below: Jeb Bush really failed there are a lot of hurt feelings  @KellyannePolls on Bush 41 voting #Clinton https://t.co/iyhiLRgrPL  OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 20, 2016This response from the Trump campaign is exactly what we d expect it to be. The Bush family is making a responsible, informed decision during this election, and that is way too much for Trump and his minions to wrap their feeble minds around. This election is no joke   it s about far more than Republican and Democrat parties. It s about saving the country from a candidate that will destroy it   and the Bush s are smart enough to recognize that.Featured image via Joe Mahoney / Getty Images",News,"September 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Says Blacks Are In Worse Shape Than During SLAVERY (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has again made a huge mistake while referring to life experienced by many black Americans every day. The screw-up in question came as Trump seriously argued that the lives of blacks today are worse than they were during slavery and in the Jim Crow segregation era.Speaking at a rally in Kenansville, North Carolina, Trump again stumbled in an apparent attempt to endear himself to black voters. We re going to make our country safe again. We re going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they ve ever been in before,  he said.  Ever, ever, ever. The comment, made in a city named for a slave owner, is objectively untrue, and completely ignores that black people were once subjected to slavery and Jim Crow laws.While the media has largely viewed Trump s weird racial comments as a sign that he is  reaching out  to black voters, polls have actually shown that he is poised to do worse with that group than Mitt Romney or John McCain.Black voters have had an inherent distrust of Trump, which has been amplified thanks to his promotion of the racist  birther  conspiracy there for years.Trump also called for the death penalty for the Central Park 5, long after it had been proven that the young black men involved with the case had been proven innocent.Lately, Trump has argued that the black community in America is a desperate, infantile mess, relying on government welfare in order to simply get by. The image Trump has been spreading has not been for black audiences, but instead have been targeted to a conservative base, high on the idea that ethnic minorities always have their hands out.Black voters have found Trump s description of them insulting, particularly coming as the community has made huge strides forward.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Protests Erupt In Charlotte After Cops Kill Disabled Black Man Who Was Reading A Book In His Car,"Protests have erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina after another African-American man was shot and killed by police on Tuesday afternoon. The victim was reportedly disabled and was reading a book in his car when cops approached him.According to police reports, officers came across Keith Lamont Scott while they were at his apartment complex to serve a warrant to someone else. Police claim that Scott had a gun and  posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers, but family and witnesses dispute that claim. A woman identifying herself as the victim s daughter, Lyric Scott, said that her father didn t have a gun, he had a book. He sits in the shade, reads his book, does his studies, and waits on his kid to get off the bus,  the woman said.  He didn t have no gun. He wasn t messing with nobody. All they did, them  jumpout boys,  them undercover detectives, they jumped out their truck, they said,  Hands up he got a gun, he got a gun, pow pow pow pow.  That s it.

 Damning New Evidence Shows Cop Who Murdered Unarmed St. Louis Man Likely Planted Gun,"In 2011, St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley shot and killed Anthony Lamar Smith, a drug suspect that he was trying to arrest. At the time, Stockley claimed that he saw Smith reaching for a gun, which is why he fired his. Self-defense, that s all it ever is, isn t it? The problem is Smith was unarmed and now there s not just evidence of that, but there s also evidence that Stockley may have done worse than lie.There is a strong possibility that he planted the gun in Smith s car after murdering him to cover his own ass.Smith did flee the scene of a possible drug deal and a high-speed chase ensued. Stockley was carrying a personally-owned AK-47 that Smith, in escaping, almost knocked out of his hands. Stockley was not authorized to carry that weapon while on duty, which goes a long way towards demonstrating Stockley as an unethical officer at the very least. He was also recorded as saying that he was going to kill Smith.Stockley s partner, Brian Bianchi, said that he warned Stockley about a revolver on the seat of Smith s car, and Stockley himself said he feared Smith was about to pull the revolver when he approached: Before striking me [with his car], I observed, in plain view in the subject s hand while resting on the passenger seat, a silver handgun. The handgun was pointing up and towards me Because of the presence of a weapon and because I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy, as was the safety of P.O. Bianchi, and bystanders, I fired several shots at the subject. It s apparently hard to see in the videos whether Stockley handled the revolver; however, it s damned telling that only his DNA was on the gun. Something of Smith would definitely have been there if he d been handling the gun, as Stockley alleged.The St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners did pay a $900,000 settlement to Smith s family in 2013, but Stockley himself was not charged with murder. That is, until this year, when this new evidence came to light.Stockley is now charged with first-degree murder, but is free on a $1 million bond. He left the St. Louis Police Department in 2013.

 Trump Used Foundation Donations To Pay Off And Settle Private Lawsuits,"Another day, another real Trump controversy. While the media hyper-focuses on Hillary Clinton s  pay-for-play  scandal (that wasn t actually a scandal, just crappy reporting from the Associated Press), a Washington Post report has found a major smoking gun regarding the Trump Foundation:Donald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire s for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents.Totaling over $258,000 in Foundation money, Trump may have been involved in has violated laws against  what is known as  self-dealing  (something Trump is used to) which prohibits nonprofit leaders from using their charity s money to benefit themselves or their private businesses.So not only has the Trump Foundation been found to have illegally contributed to politicians, it has been found to be engaging in self-dealing. And people think the Clinton Foundation is immoral?Here are some of the examples:According to the Post:In those cases, tax experts said, Trump was not allowed to simply keep these items and display them in a home or business. They had to be put to a charitable use.He did not use the paintings nor the helmet for charitable use, but rather personal use. Which is, as tax experts and the laws say, is illegal.So turns out the only  crooked  one in this race is Donald Trump, and the only fraud isn t the Clinton foundation, but the Trump Foundation. Illegal contributions, illegal lawsuit payoffs, and personal gifts with other people s money (for non charitable use).Of course, the Clinton campaign hit on the issue, saying Trump is a fraud who believes the rules don t apply to him,   and that  Clearly the Trump Foundation is as much a charitable organization as Trump University is an institute of higher education.  Ouch.Let s see Fox News and the Trump camp try to spin this.Simply put, Trump needs to be forced to pay back all that he stole from donors and all that was used illegally. And if doesn t, he should be prosecuted for being the fraud he is.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Jr. Will Absolutely Hate Who Took The Pic Of That Skittles Bowl,"Donald Trump, Jr. seems to have taken over as his father s campaign s Supervisor of Offensive Posts, particularly with some of his most recent tweets. One was of a bowl of Skittles, and asked us the really asinine question of whether we d eat those Skittles if we knew three of them were poisoned, but not which ones. He s (rightfully) caught an awful lot of flack for that, but he likely didn t expect to catch it from the man who took that photo.He probably also didn t expect the photographer to be who he is: A refugee living in the U.K. David Kittos fled Turkish occupation of Cyprus in the 1970s and has been living in the U.K. ever since. He is (quite understandably) angry by Trump Jr. s misappropriation of his image to promote a xenophobic, racist and anti-refugee policy: This was not done with my permission, I don t support his politics and I would never take his money to use it.In 1974, when I was six-years old, I was a refugee from the Turkish occupation of Cyprus so I would never approve the use of this image against refugees. Oops. That s only a minor faux pas   oh wait. It s a major embarrassment to use an image that originates with a refugee to speak out against refugees.Kittos took the picture six years ago in his studio while he was experimenting with a specific type of flash. He s not on Twitter, but friends familiar with his work let him know of this unauthorized and offensive use of one of his photos, which does appear on Flickr.Just what is up with this campaign acting like copyright only applies to other people?We digress. Anyway.Kittos  photo was never intended for political use and he certainly would never release it or sell it for such usage. Trump Jr. and others, like the disgraceful former Congresscritter Joe Walsh, don t seem to care, though, as long as they can make their point that refugees are dangerous.Wrigley, the makers of Skittles candy, also upbraided Trump Jr. for his baloney: Skittles are candy. Refugees are people.We don t feel it is an appropriate analogy. We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing. For his part, Kittos isn t sure if he s going to pursue legal action. However, he did say: I would like the Trump campaign to delete the image, but they are probably not interested in what I have to say.I was thinking about getting lawyers involved but I don t know if I have the patience.This isn t about the money for me. They could have just bought a cheap image from a micro stock library. This is pure greed from them. I don t think they care about my feelings. They should not be stealing an image full stop. And they definitely need to learn how to source copyrighted work if they re the so-called  law and order campaign  that they claim to be. But that s beside the point. Kittos is, himself, a refugee. It s natural that he would feel especially upset by this use of his image. It also speaks to the insanely tone-deaf nature of the Trump campaign. They don t care about such trivia as long as their point is made.Featured image by John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"September 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hateful Arizona Pastor Deported From Botswana After Saying Gays Should Be ‘Stoned to Death’ (VIDEO),"Wouldn t it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? Well, that s exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by Botswana for a visit and decided to preach hate.Anderson s road to Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a  roundabout  way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere. I have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,  Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The country s Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana)   and if you ve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech is kind of his  thing.  The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a  prohibited immigrant :Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana  Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016What prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be  stoned to death.  Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesn t advocate violence, the victims were  disgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway. Anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesn t believe the Bible condones slavery (it does),  if it did then yes I would condone it  because  the Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God. In the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the country s acceptance of  f*ggots, has called the Orlando massacre  good news  because a bunch of  f*ggots  died (he later expanded on that by adding that  perfect Christians  would  bathe  in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jenner s heart and even suggested executing every gay person in the world  to cure AIDS. You can watch Anderson getting snagged by immigration officials below.

 U2’s Bono Has BRUTAL Words For Donald Trump (VIDEO),"While rock band U2 s Bono has had a career of being politically outspoken, his priorities have generally been focused   primarily on improving living conditions in underdeveloped countries. Heck, the liberal Bono even found common ground with George W. Bush. There s no common ground to be found with Donald Trump, though, who the U2 singer called  potentially the worst idea that every happened to America. In an interview with CBS This Morning, Bono gave credence to the idea of American exceptionalism, but he feels that Trump destroys that. In fact, Bono says, Trump could  destroy  the very idea of America: Look, America is like the best idea the world ever came up with,  Bono, whose real name is Paul David Hewson, told  CBS This Morning  in an interview broadcast Tuesday.  But Donald Trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America. Potentially. Bono pointed to nations like Ireland and Great Britain as great countries but suggested that America is different because it s an idea, one that Trump is  trying to hijack. That idea is bound up in justice and equality for all   equality and justice for all, you know,  he continued.  I think he s hijacked the party. I think he s trying to hijack the idea of America. And I think it s bigger than all of us. I think it s   it s   this is really dangerous. Source: PoliticoHere s the video:Say what you want about the often controversial Bono, but he has seen the world and he s right. The idea of America, as a melting pot, as a place where with hard work, anyone can be a success, is not completely incompatible with Donald Trump s ideas. Trump is a xenophobe. He and his supporters want to turn our nation into a solitary island.

 Trump Jr. Once Again Shows His Lack Of Humanity With Disgusting Tweet About Syrian Refugees,"We ve all seen the horrific photos of children who are victims of the Syrian Civil War. Perhaps the most infamous is the one of the little boy sitting, covered in blood and dirt, barefoot, in the back of an ambulance. He is clearly in shock. It shows us just what that kind of war does to a society, to ordinary people, and children just like us, just like the kids in our own lives.via Mirror.co.UKWell, there is one person who is completely unmoved by these images: Donald Trump Jr. The Donald s mini me has long shown his lack of humanity. After all, he made a disgusting Holocaust reference when trying to tear down the media s coverage of Hillary Clinton, saying if the GOP did what the Democrats are doing, they d be  warming up the gas chamber.  Well, now, he s gone into the gutter again, this time regarding Syrian refugees. Trump Jr sent out the following tweet, comparing refugees to a bowl of Skittles:This image says it all.

We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing. The Trump campaign is so repugnant that even candy makers have to speak out.

 Racist Whacko Threatens Construction Crew With Gun: ‘Get These N*****s Off The Road’ (VIDEO),"A racist Georgia man went completely off the deep end when faced with road work on his way home, threatening the construction crew with a gun while shouting racial slurs.Construction worker Nelson King said that on Thursday morning they were working on a section of road in Coweta County. Harold Bishop was on his way home when he came upon the portion of the road that had been closed for construction. The 72-year-old man then proceeded to completely freak the f*ck out and began waving around a gun while shouting racial epithets at the crew. He pulled up on us and he was like,  Get these N-word off the road, I live here, I ll kill you N-word,  King recalled.When Bishop pulled out his gun for the second time, King decided to start recording the incident while another man working at the scene called 911. According to the Coweta County Sheriff s Office, Bishop then left the scene but returned before police showed up. King said he decided to record the man s threats so that he would have proof of what was happening. If I can show proof that he pulled the gun out,  said King,  police will get him. It was a good thing King had decided to make the video of Bishop threatening them with his gun because when police showed up they saw him throw a beer out of the window and smelled alcohol on him, but they could not find the weapon. That s when King whipped out the proof. I showed police the video and they seen the gun when he pointed it at us, they were like oh he s got to go,  said King.Bishop has been charged with charged with five counts of aggravated assault with a firearm, weapon pointing a gun at another, terroristic threats, DUI, and probation violation.

 George H.W. Bush May Have Just Dealt An Incredibly Stinging Blow To The Trump Train,"Guess who George H.W. Bush is voting for? He lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, and his son is George W. Bush. Yet it seems that the elder Bush finds Trump so distasteful a candidate that he s actually going to cast his vote for Hillary Clinton.According to Politico, Bush Sr. had originally planned on keeping quiet about this election. Considering the fact that he s a Republican, and therefore expected to weigh in on the side of the Republicans  chosen candidate, this is actually pretty major. But it wasn t Bush himself who revealed his vote. It was Kathleen Kennedy Townsend daughter of the late Robert Kennedy who let this particular interesting tidbit slip: On Monday, Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption:  The President told me he s voting for Hillary!!' She stood by that later on when talking to Politico. According to her, George H.W. Bush would rather vote for his former rival and successor s wife than the god-awful train wreck that is Donald Trump.A spokesman for the Bush family refused to actually confirm this   he said that George H.W. s vote is a private decision and will remain so. He himself isn t commenting, but it seems that those who are in his inner circle aren t being so tight-lipped, if Kennedy is to be believed.Bush Sr. did make it clear back in May that he had absolutely zero intention of endorsing Trump. That s a bold, but wise, move for any Republican, since Republicans are supposed to be on the side of freedom and Trump is on the side of dictatorship and authoritarianism.His love of Russian president Vladimir Putin would suggest that he s also on the side of autocracy. None of these three things meshes with the democracy Republicans say we ve built in even the smallest way.Earlier in the summer, an administration official for George W. Bush announced that she would vote for Hillary, adding her name to an ever-growing list of Republicans and conservatives who can t find it within themselves to support Trump. Jeb Bush has said he can neither vote for Hillary nor Trump.A former Republican president refusing to stand for the current Republican nominee is a stinging blow indeed.Featured image by Scott Halleran/Getty Images",News,"September 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Donald Trump Says Constitution Should Not Give Everyone The Right To Due Process,"If Donald Trump has his way, the constitutional right to due process will only belong to white racists.In the wake of the bombing in New York City over the weekend, police were able to apprehend a suspect named Ahmad Khan Rahami after a shootout.Rahami was hit and needed to be hospitalized to get his gunshot wound treated. And as an American citizen, he is also guaranteed the right to an attorney even if he cannot afford one.Why? Because the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Constitution say so.But Republican nominee Donald Trump thinks the amendments should be scrapped in Rahami s case. You know, because he s a Muslim.During a rally in Florida on Monday, Trump whined because Rahami is being treated in a hospital for his wound and further complained about him being represented by a competent defense attorney. Now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer. His case will go through the various court systems for years and in the end, people will forget and his punishment will not be what it once would have been. What a sad situation. Trump, who advocates for torture techniques, also demanded a speedy trial resulting in  harsh punishment  and suggested using  whatever lawful methods are available to obtain information from the apprehended suspect to get information before it s no longer timely. Here s the video via YouTube.The Fifth Amendment states:No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.Rahami is innocent until proven guilty. So not letting him get the treatment he needs could lead to him dying from an infection or loss of blood, thus depriving him of life without due process.Furthermore, the Sixth Amendment clearly gives everyone the right to an attorney, even a bombing suspect.In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.The right to have an attorney is one of the most foundational values of the country, most exemplified by Founding Father John Adams, who defended the British soldiers who were arrested after the Boston Massacre in 1770.In short, it doesn t matter who the suspect is or what they did, they have the right to due process and an attorney in this country. But Donald Trump apparently wants to put a  white s only  sign on the Constitution.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.Trump is saying  yes  to Fox News almost every day but saying  no  to most other major networks and news organizations   a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.He called into  Fox & Friends  on Monday morning, he is booked on  The O Reilly Factor  Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate s exposure to hard-hitting questions   while fueling frustration among journalists.At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn t challenged   and that s the way he wants it.The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn t reaching out.It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in  swing  districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney  landslide  the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Sickening Pro-Gun Meme Is Quite Possibly The Most Vile Thing On The Internet (IMAGE),"The pro-gun crowd loves guns first, and respect last. At least, that seems to be the case with whoever made a truly horrible meme out of an old black-and-white war photo. The photo depicts troops executing a couple of people in the back as they kneel in front of a mass grave. The troops  are just obeying orders,  and the dead in the mass grave are  citizens obeying gun laws. This is the meme:Image via TwitterWe don t know who created this, but we don t have enough middle fingers to express how we feel about them. The piece of shit behind this is no doubt someone who believes the lie that, had the Jewish citizens of Germany and elsewhere just had guns, the Holocaust wouldn t have happened.The photo in the meme is from the German-occupied Soviet Union, and depicts one of the mobile execution squads known as the Einsatzgr ppen. They were tasked with mass executions of Jews, communists, and anyone else that the Nazis decided weren t suitable to living their empire and master race. Tens of thousands were murdered this way   they are part of the Holocaust.The myth of guns and the Holocaust is so completely and terribly wrong it defies description. Yes, the Nazis seized guns from their enemies, however, they actually didn t make much of a dent in total gun circulation in Germany, contrary to what the gun-rights crowd wants us to believe.Furthermore, the Nazis actually loosened gun laws in 1938 for everyone except Jews. People who have a basic understanding of Nazi Germany know that the Nazis targeted more groups than Jews, and they know that more people than Jews opposed the Nazis however quietly they had to.Why didn t those people, who could own guns, rise up? It s because of the power of a police state   the very thing the  moar gunz  crowd fears the most.Therefore, the cretin who came up with this meme can rightfully be termed as having no clue what they are talking about. But worse than that, they have no problem whatsoever with using the horror of the Holocaust to further their  all guns all the time  agenda. That is just abominable, and has no place in any discourse at all. Here s why: This historical second-guessing is deeply offensive to Jews, Holocaust survivors and those who valiantly fought against Hitler during World War II. It is, in fact, as many historians have previously noted, a distortion of history itself When you manipulate the history of the Holocaust and use it to score political points, its wholly inappropriate and offensive. Especially for the sake of the victims of the Nazi onslaught and their memory, it must stop. That s from Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. He was speaking against Ben Carson s painfully offensive assertion that the Nazis had disarmed everyone so they could kill Jews with impunity, but it s just not true. And it s an serious affront to every single victim of the Nazis, as well as everyone who fought them.This meme s creator ought to go back to the depths of the hellish abyss that first spat him out.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News,"September 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Paul Ryan’s New Economic Plan Is Just Gawd Awful (VIDEO),"While the media is focused on the horserace that will help determine politics for the next eight years, they re pretty much ignoring the fact that Washington is still in business and Republicans are busy being Republicans, which is to say that the rich will be getting richer while everyone else will be getting poorer.Ryan, who s not sure he can back Donald Trump, likely because Trump dares say the things that Republicans generally say behind closed doors, has released a new domestic plan, called,  A Better Way.  Ryan calls it his antidote to anger and division. The only problem is that if anyone pays attention to the plan, they will be angry at how he divides Americans into tax brackets, and as usual, the top tax brackets win.His plan includes a lot of Republican staples, like more military, less regulation, repealing Obamacare and deep cuts for poor people. In other words, same old cold-hearted Ayn Rand  I got mine, now f*** you  GOP themes. Perhaps the worst part, though, is the tax plan. There are a lot of tax cuts (mostly at the cost to poor people) and nearly all of those   99.6 percent   go to the top one percent.A typical Republican tax cut will give about 40 percent of its tax cuts to the richest one percent. Ryan s plan, according to a new analysis by the Tax Policy Center, will give three-quarters of its tax cuts to the richest one percent in the first year. And that s only because the cuts are slowly phased in. By 2025, the highest-earning one percent will enjoy 99.6 percent of the tax cuts. The remaining 0.4 percent will be divided up among the other 99 percent of the country. The new Paul Ryan tax cuts make the Bush tax cuts look like socialism.Source: NY MagazineHere s the video:While Ryan likes to separate himself from Donald Trump, his plan proves his policies are no less racist and classist than the worst Trump can imagine. He s just hoping we won t notice.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.",News,"September 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Inmate Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July.[ ]Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas  death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomas  jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the man s life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from  speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.

 Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned  rapists  and  drug dealers  from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a  temporary measure.  He s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad: The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don t kid yourself. When they say they don t care about their lives, you have to take out their families. But he s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism   he s fighting the  narratives  of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump s  narrative  is  kill them all :Last weekend s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we re in more than a fight about  narratives    these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.Pay attention to that last bit:  They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens. Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is  radical Islamic terrorism,  and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating  terrorists? They re protecting each other, but they re really doing very bad damage they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,  Trump said in March.  When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that s a big problem. If Muslims are  protecting  terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists  families. How would he define terrorism?These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself   but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents  security to  see what happens  to them (shortly after suggesting that  Second Amendment People  could deal with them. We re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the  little red button  that launches our nuclear arsenal.It s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen   one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He s said it himself. Many times.If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation   to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.Featured image via Getty Images/Joe Raedle",News,"September 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Is Crushing An Int’l Tradition That Even Worldwide Hatred Of George W. Couldn’t Dent,"The whole world is talking about Donald Trump, over which he is no doubt preening because any attention is good attention as long as it s focused entirely on him. But besides the obvious problems with this, there s one tradition that s very important among international leaders and diplomats. Trump is getting dangerously close to destroying it.The tradition is this: You don t trash-talk a foreign country s political candidates.That might seem silly. It might seem trivial. It s not. This is a very old tradition that was actually turned into policy at the 1961 Vienna Convention. While different countries interpret  Thou shalt not interfere in foreign countries  elections  differently, most are careful to keep their mouths shut, at least publicly. Even in 2004, when the whole world hated George W. Bush for the fiasco that was Iraq, foreign diplomats and leaders mostly kept quiet.Not so now. Trump is testing everyone s patience, and many find that they just can t keep it to themselves: If you represent one of these countries that has been insulted or attacked, you tend to react. We are very passionate, and our blood is pretty hot. But we have to play it cool and understand that this is a campaign, and an election, and that we are diplomats. This week, thousands of foreign diplomats are gathering in New York City for the U.N. General Assembly. Trump has insulted a great many of them in one way or another. What the Latin-American diplomat said to Politico is true around the world: Adding to the complications is that U.S. elections are increasingly followed intensely by people overseas, whether it s via Facebook or CNN International. So when a U.S. presidential candidate slams a foreign country as Trump has so often (with Mexico, Japan, China, members of NATO, and on and on) representatives of those countries feel unusual domestic pressure to respond. Wars of words could easily escalate into more serious wars with Trump. He s proven that with his threats against both Ted Cruz and John Kasich for the 2018 midterms   he can t let a slight go.As another example of how he goes after everyone who pisses him off: He s busy trash-talking a Scottish whiskey company for daring to give an award to a neighbor of his who criticizes his golf course. In retaliation, he s banned every brand of whiskey from William Grant & Sons for that affront, because really, how dare they?He should have more important things to worry about than petty personal slights, but they re actually the centerpiece of his whole existence. When foreign leaders won t play ball his way, and go on record with nothing but what he thinks are insults, what s he going to do? Two guesses what he ll do, but you ll only need one.He hasn t even been elected yet and foreign leaders and diplomats are openly attacking him. Some of these people probably held their tongues when George W. was running for re-election, however hard that might have been. This would be hilarious if it wasn t so frightening.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Robert Reich Just Ruined A Trump Supporter’s Week With Facts,"You ve got to love Robert Reich. The former Secretary of Labor under future First Lady and former President Bill Clinton met a Trump supporter at a coffee shop and couldn t resist stopping for a moment to ruin the poor guy s week by introducing him to a concept that is foreign to him: facts. I finally found a Trump supporter   this morning when I went to buy coffee. (I noticed a Trump bumper sticker on his car.),  Reich writes in a Facebook post that has gone viral since he posted it Monday morning. Then he completely dismantled Trump   politely   before the guy s very eyes: Hi,  I said.  Noticed your Trump bumper sticker. Yup,  he said, a bit defensively. I hope you don t mind my asking, but I m curious. Why are you supporting him? I know he s a little bit much,  said the Trump supporter.  But he s a successful businessman. And we need a successful businessman as president. How do you know he s a successful businessman?  I asked. Because he s made a fortune. Has he really?  I asked. Of course. Forbes magazine says he s worth four and a half billion. That doesn t mean he s been a success,  I said. In my book it does,  said the Trump supporter. You know, in 1976, when Trump was just starting his career, he said he was worth about $200 million,  I said.  Most of that was from his father. That just proves my point,  said the Trump supporter.  He turned that $200 million into four and a half billion. Brilliant man. But if he had just put that $200 million into an index fund and reinvested the dividends, he d be worth twelve billion today,  I said.The Trump supporter went silent. And he got about $850 million in tax subsidies, just in New York alone,  I said.More silence. He s not a businessman, Reich concluded.  He s a con man.  Hope you enjoy your coffee. While it s unlikely that Reich managed to change the Trump fan s mind   or even reach him on a level that matters   he surely left the guy steaming more than a freshly-brewed cup of go-go- juice.

 Trump Gets ANNIHILATED On Twitter After He Pretends He Didn’t Just Trash Police Officers (TWEETS),"On Monday, Donald Trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching Ahmad Khan Rahami, who was responsible for the Saturday bombing in New York City.TwitterThis would have normally been a nice gesture, if it hadn t been a contradiction of something Trump had said just a few minutes before. Fortunately, whenever Trump flip-flops or lies, Americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media   and they didn t hesitate to remind Trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for Rahami s capture, he d dissed the NYPD for allowing  political correctness  to interfere with catching terrorists. Among the first to point this out was MSNBC s Christopher Hayes, who tweeted: Twitter Hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment Trump had made on Fox and Friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said: You know, our police are amazing, our local police. They know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because they don t want to be accused of profiling, and they don t want to be accused of all sorts of things. Yup   Trump had accused the NYPD of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. Other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the Republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterThis tweet was particularly funny, and I m sure there will be some backlash for Trump to deal with:TwitterThroughout his presidential campaign, Trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than African American police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a  law and order  candidate. But thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, Trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning.Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NRA’s Ted Nugent Unleashes Disgusting Attack On ‘Pathetic’ Unarmed Mass-Stabbing Victims (SCREENSHOTS),"NRA board member, draft-dodger, pedophile, and all-around terrible person Ted Nugent has a message for those  embarrassing  and  pathetic  victims of a recent mass-stabbing at a Minnesota mall   and it s one that no decent person would even consider.On September 17, an attacker apparently affiliated with ISIS stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnetota. He was eventually fatally shot by an off-duty police officer. Fortunately, the victims  injuries were not life-threatening   something most would celebrate, but Nugent deigns it appropriate to simply attack the victims because they didn t bring their guns to a knife-attack.In one of his traditionally hateful Facebook posts, Nugent unleashed on the victims in exactly the manner one would expect from a man who assumed legal custody of a 17-year-old girl so he could have sex with her. Calling the victims  sad soulless & embarrassing,  Nugent mocked them for being  so pathetic  and  helpless,  remarking that  apparently most Americans like being victims :Previously, Nugent has attacked  losers  who don t carry guns after the mass shooting at Umpqua community College in Oregon last year, blaming them for being victims because they choose not to carry a security blanket firearm around. Nugent falsely claimed that students were not allowed to carry guns on campus because of laws and regulations, but Newsweek reported at the time that the campus was not a  gun-free zone  and that it was  common knowledge  many students were armed. Disarmed and helpless is an irresponsible, suicidal choice that will get you killed,  Nugent disgustingly concluded.  Defend yourself. Victim-blaming is a hallmark of the Right   something we can expect to see more and more of if Donald Trump is elected in November. Get out there and do something about it.Featured image via Getty Images(Randy Snyder)/screengrab",News,"September 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Blamed Bombings On ‘Freedom Of The Press’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump appeared on Fox & Friends Monday morning and blamed the weekend attacks in New Jersey and New York City on refugees, a lack of profiling by law enforcement, and the First Amendment. Conservatives always go right past that First Amendment and only abide by the Second.Trump took aim at refugees; however, bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, is a naturalized citizen.A Fox & Friends host asked Trump what he would do to stop  people who are radicalized here. Trump responded to that by saying  freedom of the press  was to blame. They re all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, it s called  freedom of the press,  where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw,  Trump said.  They tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people that do that because they re participating in crime. Instead they say  oh no you can t do anything, that s freedom of expression. The websites are the same thing, those people should be arrested. They re inciting violence, okay?  he continued.  They re making violence possible. They should be arrested immediately yet we don t want to touch them because of freedom of speech. Watch at around the 21 minute mark:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GTRabASaY8]However, incitement is already an exception to the First Amendment.Think Progress reports:It s a high bar to prove for which Trump may have reason to be personally grateful. Under a laxer rule, it s possible that Trump could be charged for incitement himself. In August, his statement that  Second Amendment people  could be able to do something about Hillary Clinton was met with widespread condemnation as a veiled assassination threat. On Friday, he called for Clinton s bodyguards to  disarm immediately,  adding  let s see what happens to her. Donald has attacked Freedom of the Press many times. Most recently, his campaign had a VICE reporter arrested. The GOP presidential nominee has gone as far as to defend Vladimir Putin for killing journalists.Trump said of Putin after being confronted by Joe Scarborough over the Russian leader s bloody history with journalists,  He s running his country, and at least he s a leader. Unlike what he have in this country. Freedom of the Press is part of our Constitution. It s not up for debate, unless Melania Trump feels like suing bloggers for quoting from a source.But if you ask Donald Trump Jr., he ll tell you that political correctness is to blame for terrorist attacks.Ironically, Junior s pinned tweet reads,  Liberals love the first amendment until you say something they don t agree with. He really should change that.Featured image via Brian Blanco via Getty.",News,"September 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Seth MacFarlane Just Told Johnson And Stein Supporters EXACTLY What They Need To Hear (TWEET),"In a perfect democracy, there would be multiple viable parties to choose candidates from. Each one would have to work hard and strive for our vote, and each one would have an equal chance at winning. Unfortunately, because of the way election laws and funding are currently in the United States, we re pretty much stuck with a two-party system and any third-party vote goes to help one of the two major parties.Think Ralph Nader in 2000 and how his votes in Florida gave us George W. Bush. Well, Nader and the Supreme Court.It s imperfect, but until laws are changed, it is what it is. No amount of whining or sitting elections out is going to change that. What we need are legislators willing to change the laws, but that s never going to happen if people keep having hissy fits.This year s election is so critical not just for the nation, but the entire world. A Donald Trump presidency would be catastrophic on so many levels, both with domestic and foreign policy.Reminding everyone how important this election is, and how a third-party vote will give us a President Trump, is none other than the legendary writer/producer and creator of Family Guy, Seth MacFarlane.MacFarlane tweeted: Remember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein! Happy Election Year! Remember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein! Happy Election Year!  Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) September 19, 2016His sarcasm is more a terrifying wake-up call than just witty banter on the Twitter machine.Does this mean you shouldn t vote for Stein or Johnson? No, of course not. However, it needs to be brought to people s attention that their vote for a third party isn t actually going to put their candidate into office, but rather have the possibility of ushering in the apocalypse with Trump.A  conscience vote  does not do anyone any good with a Fascist in the White House, and it goes much deeper than just feeling good about yourself on election day.So, do what you do. That s your freedom to do so, but remember the unintended consequences of that vote and what will be in store for the entire world.Featured Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:Here s Google:Naturally, my reaction was  oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife s campaign now? Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don t do, to find out the real story   and the real story is that there is no pay to play. It was natural for people who ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn t do anything they shouldn t do,  Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNNIn other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn t mean they ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there s no evidence they got them.Now, let s talk about the foundation the media doesn t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump s charitable foundation over concerns that it  engaged in some impropriety  as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others  contributions  to make them appear to have come from him  although he  hasn t given to the foundation since 2008. Source: Media MattersMedia Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton s candidacy:Journalists have been criticized for the  double standard  in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump s Dr. Oz stunt.All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton  scandal  (if you call getting sick a  scandal ) while ignoring every scandal in Trump s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.",News,"September 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox News Gets OWNED By Police Chief For Demonizing Immigrants In Minnesota,"The hosts of Fox & Friends were hoping a Minnesota police chief would vilify the Somali immigrants in his community and they promptly got their asses handed to them.On Saturday, 22-year-old Dahir A. Adan went on a stabbing spree inside a Minnesota mall. The Somali community in St. Cloud has roundly condemned the act of terrorism, but Republican nominee Donald Trump spewed fear and hate in response during a phone call with Fox and called the immigrants a  Trojan horse  and a  cancer from within  that benefits ISIS.Fox host Steve Doocy, who was named in Gretchen Carlson s sexual harassment lawsuit against the conservative network, asked St. Cloud Police Chief William Blair Anderson if he agrees with Trump s assessment of immigrants, clearly hoping that Anderson would join in demonizing them.Instead, Anderson swatted Doocy down like the pest he is and made it clear that there are bad apples in every group and that we should unite rather than divide and hate. My job is public safety. It s not in immigration policy. I can tell you that the vast majority of all of our citizens, no matter their ethnicity, are fine, hard-working people, and now is not the time for us to be divisive. We already have a very cohesive community, and I expect that this will draw us even closer together. But at the end of the day, our job is public safety, period. Anderson then explained that law enforcement works well with all members of the community to protect the public the best they can. We actually work very well not just with our East African community, but all of our community. We meet regularly with any number of people, whether they are advocates for a specific ethnicity or different cause. It s one of things that makes St. Cloud a wonderful place to live, and I know that might sound corny, but it s the truth. We have established and maintained a very good rapport with our East African community and our community at large. Doocy then tucked his tail between his legs and ended the interview because he didn t get the response he wanted.Here s the video via Media Matters:Demonizing an entire community simply because of the actions of a few only ostracizes them and could cause more to radicalize. That s why we should reach out to these immigrants instead of hating them.Fox News is irresponsibly pushing an  us versus them  mentality that only creates a never-ending circle of hate and mistrust that hurts our country in the long-term. But let s also remember that ISIS would not exist to recruit people in America in the first place had Republicans not pursued an unnecessary war in Iraq that created the power vacuum that allowed ISIS to rise. Furthermore, despite their concerns and their whining, Republicans still refuse to declare war on ISIS to give President Obama the full resources of the United States to fight the terrorist organization.Regardless, any group will have bad apples, even the white  Christians  Fox News caters to. Let s not forget that Timothy McVeigh committed the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that killed 168 people while Dylan Roof gunned down nine black people inside a church in 2015. Both acts of domestic terrorism were committed by white males who were born here in the United States. But Fox News would rather freak out about a Somali immigrant who used a knife in an attack in which no one was killed. If Adan were white, not only would this not be referred to as an act of terror, it would have been a mere footnote in the news.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"September 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn t exactly go over well.One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.Chelsea began by asking Priebus: Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile? Adding: This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile. Chelsea then said: Stop telling women to smile. We don t like that. It s not an icebreaker, it s a deal breaker. Going for Priebus  jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says: You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November.

 Michigan Republicans Strip Flint Of Their Power To Sue The State Over Poisoned Water,"The city of Flint, Michigan is suffering through a horrible man-made disaster that could have been easily prevented if state Republicans hadn t been so careless.After placing Flint under state control, officials chose to save money by switching the city s drinking water from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which has not been the drinking water source for decades because it was poisoned and considered unsafe for human consumption.As a result, the city has been devastated by lead poisoning, which will have terrible consequences for years to come for the children who ingested the tainted water.Understandably, Flint is mad as hell so they decided to take the state to court. But because Michigan Republicans and Governor Rick Snyder are rats who hate democracy and justice, they shut down any potential lawsuit by stripping Flint of the power to sue.According to the Detroit Free Press:Though Flint has not been under a state-appointed emergency manager since April 2015, the state still exerts partial control over the city through a five-member Receivership Transition Advisory Board, whose members are appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder.The board moved quickly to change the rules under which Flint is governed so that the city cannot file a lawsuit without first getting approval from that state-appointed board.This is absolutely outrageous. It s like a woman having to get permission to file a lawsuit from the company whose CEO raped her.Michigan Republicans should not have the power to take away anyone s right to seek redress through the court system. It sounds like they are just scared that they will lose the case. And frankly, they should be.After all, it was their decisions that led to Flint being poisoned with tainted water and the cover-up that followed. The city of Flint absolutely should be able to sue the state in open court. But Republicans took that power away from Flint, and you can be damn sure that they would love to do that in every city across all fifty states if they have their way.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John Kasich Tells GOP Chair Reince Priebus To Go F*ck Himself,"Reince Priebus openly threatened Kasich and other Republicans that they better blindly support Donald Trump or face the end of their careers. John Kasich doesn t give a shit about Priebus  pathetic threats.On Sunday, the GOP Chair suggested that Republicans who don t fall in line behind Trump could be severely punished in their endeavors to seek election or re-election. Those people need to get on board,  Priebus told Face The Nation: And if they re thinking they re going to run again someday, I think that we re going to evaluate the process   of the nomination process and I don t think it s going to be that easy for them. In order to be on the ballot in South Carolina, you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee, no matter who that person is. So what s the penalty for that? It s not a threat, but that s just the question that we have a process in place. Kasich has repeatedly refused to endorse Donald Trump and did not take kindly to Priebus  threat, issuing a brutal response through his spokesman John Weaver. Thankfully, there are still leaders in this country who put principles before politics. The idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like Reince Priebus, but it is at the center of everything Governor Kasich does The Governor is traveling the nation supporting down ballot Republicans and preventing a potential national wipeout from occurring on Reince s watch. Weaver also added that Priebus should be thanking Kasich.So the next time John Kasich seeks re-election or high office it s going to be interesting to watch how Priebus responds. Will he follow through on his threat or will he do an about-face and all of a sudden support Kasich?Threatening someone with political ruin just because they don t support the terrible choice of nominee your party made sounds more like what dictators or fascists do. It s definitely not the hallmark of a party that supposedly supports our democracy. Because by trying to force Republicans to vote a certain way, they are undermining democracy and all the values this country was founded upon.If anyone deserves political backlash, it s Reince Priebus. He created a political atmosphere so toxic that they now have Trump as their leader. The Republicans standing against Trump are the sane ones.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Montel Williams DESTROYS Pro-Trump Pastor In INSANE Twitter Fight (TWEETS),"Montel Williams isn t afraid to express his absolute disgust and disdain for Republican nominee Donald Trump   he s made it perfectly clear in the past that he would never support or vote for him, and continuously speaks out against the business mogul.That s why there was nothing unusual about what Williams did over the weekend, when the radio talk show host called out one of Trump s biggest supporters   Pastor Mark Burns. When Williams saw Burns complaining about the media s hesitance to call the weekend explosions in New York City a terror attack, he couldn t just let it slide.TwitterBurns was merely echoing what Trump himself had said, when the GOP presidential candidate jumped to conclusions and immediately called the explosion a  bomb  even before officials could investigate or confirm it. Fed up with the baseless fear mongering the Trump campaign has been become infamous for doing, Williams flat-out told Burns he d had  enough of your crap. TwitterLittle did Burns know when he responded to Williams, that he d just started a Twitter fight that he had no chance of winning:TwitterWilliams was not going to back down, and as the day continued the men continued to take shots at each other, with Williams continuously calling the Trump-loving pastor out for falsifying details of his past and stating that Burns was not even a real pastor.  What resulted was a seemingly never-ending stream of back and forth tweets, in which Burns was clearly on the losing side:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterWilliams had ripped Burns a new one and exposed all of his flaws for all of social media to see.

 Dear Trump: ISIS Is NOT A Football Game,"When Donald Trump talks about America, he often talks about how we don t  win anymore.  We don t win on manufacturing. We don t win on trade. We don t win on economics. We don t win against ISIS. It s that last point I wish to address, because Trump said at a recent rally: Our military can t beat ISIS. Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur or the great General George Patton saying we can t beat ISIS. Patton would rip your heart out if you ever said that. We can t beat   right? Can you imagine that though? Can you imagine what   they re spinning right now. They re watching. They re spinning in their grave. You, Donnie Trump, go on, and speak like MacArthur and Patton talk to you. You sound like you ve assured them you can win here, and you ll do them proud. Is that how you see it, Donnie?You re ignoring an awful lot there, Donnie. Neither MacArthur nor Patton behaved the way you do. They were tacticians, not juggernauts who rolled to victory in every single engagement. They knew when to steamroll, and when to pull back and regroup. In your crusade against anything that even remotely looks like weakness, you ve taught your dense and idiotic followers that winning against ISIS is as simple as a football game.Simply act like we can win, and we ll win.I m sure that our dear Mr. Trump does not see anything wrong with talking this way. After all, nothing he ever does is wrong. Period. End of. However, the problem is not how he sees it. The problem is the message he s putting forth. He s treating war, and terrorism, like they re football games. If we just think positively, believe we can win, and stop acting like we can t beat ISIS, we ll beat them handily.That s not true.Generals Patton and MacArthur were so successful in part because they were realistic. There were massive failures during WWII. We did not ride in on this white horse to save the day. However, Donnie disgustingly buys into that very narrative.We didn t.MacArthur was already in the Philippines when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. In the ensuing months, he suffered grievous defeats. He actually ordered a withdrawal to Australia to regroup. He was human. His troops were human. Japan was a juggernaut at the time, and we couldn t beat them with brute force.What do you think of that, Donnie? MacArthur actually ordered a retreat. Isn t that giving up? Isn t that what you re railing against? MacArthur is remembered as great because of things like this. Not in spite of them, and definitely not because they didn t happen.Then there s Patton. He does seem to have been more the style that you see in your head. For instance, he s reported to have said: We shall attack and attack until we are exhausted, and then we shall attack again. Yet he was surrounded by controversy over his leadership methods. Congress and the military actually demanded his removal from command after he slapped a soldier who was suffering from battle fatigue. There were other such incidents, too, but his qualifications are what kept him in the field. He might have stormed through battle zones like Bastogne (do you even know which battle that was, Donnie?), ending them, but he was far from perfect.Donnie, all you do is talk about winning and losing, and yet, nobody has ever conceded defeat to ISIS. Nobody in U.S. leadership has said,  We can t beat ISIS.  Not our president, not our current commanders. A coach telling his football team  We can t do this,  hands the game to the other team. Our military doesn t operate like that, however. It never has. It operates with the understanding that there will be defeats. Learning from those defeats is key to beating ISIS   something you would know if you weren t such a conceited bastard.On the ground, unit commanders, all the way down to squad leaders, will give pep talks. Yes, that is normal, and you and I both know it. However, those who are guiding the entire war have to be realistic, or they will end up losing it, and they know it.It s not a football game.ISIS is not WWII, and it s definitely not a game, Donnie. Your treating it as such doesn t just show astonishing arrogance, but it also shows that you re wholly unqualified to be the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military. You will never be able to understand how anything works as long as you keep treating everything as winning versus losing.As though it s a goddamn football game. It s not.

" Trump Retweets Article That Destroyed Him, And He Was Too Dumb To Know It","Donald Trump is perhaps the most predictable person who s ever run for president. If someone disses him, they are enemies for life, and if someone says something positive about the self-proclaimed (we won t believe it unless he releases his tax returns) billionaire, brutal dictator or not, they will have Trump s loyalty and respect.Now, things get a little weird when people are sarcastic, as is the case with a Washington Post article that, if you didn t read it, might be something somewhat positive about the GOP nominee. Trump obviously didn t read the article. He would have hated it, but he did retweet the article entitled  Donald Trump s birther event is the greatest trick he s ever pulled : Donald Trump s birther event is the greatest trick he s ever pulled https://t.co/zvVQnxeiQ9  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016Most of us, at least those of us who are capable of critical thought, would probably not assume that the article was a positive portrayal of Trump s birther farce, but, well, we re talking about Trump. As for the article, no, it was pretty brutal toward Trump. Here are a few snippets:Donald Trump is, at heart, a showman. He rose to national fame thanks to star turns on reality TV in which he played the tough-talking boss to a group of aspirants hoping to become as successful as he has been in business. His great gift is the ability to draw attention   and then use that attention for his own, usually commercial, purposes.Trump might have read that far. He s proud of being a showman and he s pretty damned good at it, in much the same way that snake oil salesmen were good at their jobs.Trump may have outdone himself on Friday morning. He and his campaign touted a  major  announcement at his newly opened hotel in Washington, D.C., at 10 a.m. The word was that Trump would walk away from his past skepticism about President Obama s citizenship while also laying the blame for the birther movement at the feet of Hillary Clinton. (That, of course, isn t true   according to numerous fact-checkers   but no matter: Trump planned to say it anyway.)The article goes on to fact check some of Trump s many lies, especially in regard to the birther controversy. No, Hillary Clinton didn t start it and yes, Donald Trump has long been a birther.The Washington Post then went on to describe the event, and it wasn t flattering. This is how they described Trump s announcement:Three sentences from Trump himself   one that is totally false and two others that represent a total reversal from a position he held as recently as, well, Thursday night.Clearly, Trump didn t read the article, which is a little frightening. Presidents are given several pages, if not hundreds, of important documents ever single day. It s critical that our President read and not just assume and retweet.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" A Dallas Cop Just Filed Suit Against Obama, Hillary, Black Lives Matter For Really Bizarre Conspiracy","A Dallas police officer, seeing red after several shootings of police officers, has decided he s had enough and he and his lawyer, are going to punish everyone they absolutely can for allegedly conspiring to create a race war. Yes, this is the same  race war  that the entire right sees whenever people call attention to the racism that permeates our justice system.Police Sergeant Demetrick Pennie, a 17-year veteran of the Dallas police force, is suing leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement   along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, billionaire George Soros, Louis Farrakhan, former Attorney General Eric Holder, President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and many more. The bizarre part is that he and his attorney, right-wing nut Larry Klayman, actually see an active conspiracy here: This is a civil action for the deprivation of Plaintiffs and other members of the class herein of their civil rights, conspiracy against the Plaintiffs and other members of the class herein civil rights and obstruction of justice to prevent the enforcement of civil rights. The complaint also says this: Klayman received a call from Defendant New Black Panther Party and Black Lives Matter acting in concert with the other Defendants, all of whom are working together to ignite and continue the race war they have fomented, threatening to kill him and his family.  [emphasis mine]In discussing the July 7 murders of Dallas police officers, the lawsuit states that the shooting suspect claimed he was acting alone, and was not affiliated with Black Lives Matter or anything else. An investigation into his background allegedly revealed that he was a member of the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party.Apparently, that s enough to tie him and these groups directly to Hillary, Obama, Holder, and everyone else, although it s hard to see how Klayman and Pennie actually know there s a conspiracy here.It s like they just know   the complaint repeatedly states something along these lines: Defendants, acting in concert, and each and every one of them are inciting the imminent serious bodily injury and killing of police officers and other law enforcement persons Acting in concert  means there s a knowing cooperation between two or more people to accomplish something. There s no real, concrete evidence that anybody is actively working with anyone else to incite violence against police officers. Yet, they keep using that phrase. We do not think it means what they think it means. Either that, or a frightening amount of paranoia fueled this. Or both.It s probably both.The complaint also accuses everyone of spreading the fiction that police officers  are intentionally and systematically targeting and hunting blacks and other minorities to kill them for no reason other than racism or sport.  Exaggerate much, Klayman? Lords, gods and minor deities, it s amazing these conclusions are in an actual complaint filed in an actual court.Other known problems, such as arresting or shooting black people not guilty of any crimes, and that minorities are arrested and prosecuted disproportionately to the general population, are fiction on the planet from whence this complaint arose, too.Klayman, however, has been looking for a reason to file a suit like this for some time. Back in July, he threatened to sue Obama, Farrakhan, Sharpton and Black Lives Matter for putting his life in danger  as a white person.  At the time, he said things like this: It is no wonder some cops, fearing for their lives in this anti-white, anti-Semitic and anti-Christian environment, sometimes are prone to literally pull the trigger too quickly. He s not exactly the most credible person here. He has an axe to grind, and it doesn t make Pennie look good for retaining him for this suit (or did Klayman persuade Pennie to finally give him what he needs to make a suit stick? We may never know).The discovery phase of this lawsuit ought to be interesting.The entire 66-page complaint is below:[scribd id=324251965 key=key-2XEsBrU2vkK8S40trOMu mode=scroll]Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 One Of Hillary’s Opponents Could Drop Out And Endorse Her (VIDEO),"Every four years, we re told that the upcoming presidential election is the most important in our lifetimes. While it does seem that every election cycle the consequences become much more serious, this one is particularly notable because, regardless of politics, it s a clear choice between sane and insane.Donald Trump is insane. Obviously, we re not saying that in a clinical way because fortunately, we ve never met him, but he s thin-skinned, narcissistic, a pathological liar and doesn t give a crap about anyone other than himself. Politics aside, those qualities should keep him out of office.While there are a number of third party candidates running this time around, only one third party ticket is on the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and that s the Libertarian ticket of Gary Johnson and his vice presidential candidate Bill Weld.Famed Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein believes the Johnson/Weld ticket might not hold up for long, and that Weld could be dropping out of the race to support Hillary Clinton.The Green Party ticket is on the ballot in 40 states and Washington, D.C. The Libertarian ticket is currently polling at 9 percent and the Green Party ticket is polling at 3 percent. Many are saying that the third party tickets are siphoning votes from Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump and according to Bernstein, Weld might not be able to live with that fact. He has  another day to fight for libertarianism,  according to Bernstein. He also believes that Weld could help bring Millennials into the Democratic fold. Bill Weld does not want to be Ralph Nader,   says Bernstein. Nader, as you recall, ran against Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000 and many say that Gore would have won if Nader had not been in the race.Bernstein also feels that Weld is spinning his wheels on the Johnson ticket. He called Johnson a  flake,  and said that Weld wants to make a difference and the difference he can make is supporting Clinton.Here s the video:Could Libertarian VP candidate renounce his candidacy?  Bill Weld does not want to be Ralph Nader.    @carlbernstein https://t.co/TzGOzMcM2z  CNN Tonight (@CNNTonight) September 17, 2016Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.",News,"September 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 These Banks Are Fighting The Cycle Of Poverty In Places The Major Banks Won’t Go,"A recent special report by James Trimarco for Yes! Magazine has shined a spotlight on the way that certain banking institutions have perpetuated cycles of poverty and institutionalized economic racism. It also shows how a very specific set of banks are working to smash those systems. These banks are called Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs).Traditional banks have only one goal to make a profit. They are also incredibly racist, locking people of color out from being able to access capital. Research from MIT in 2008 found that lack of access to capital is the number one driving factor in racial disparities across a range of economic metrics such as profits and employment.CDFIs are not purely profit motivated, so they can serve areas that traditional banks won t, particularly in rural areas and communities of color.  Trimarco looked at how CDFI s are changing lives in the poorest region in the poorest state in the U.S.   the Mississippi Delta region. He writes: Mississippi has more CDFIs per capita than any other state. Its financial ecosystem is a unique place, where bankers and residents are coming to see one another as allies despite a difficult history. It s a window into what the United States might look like if the government actively recruited banks and credit unions as allies in the fight against poverty. CDFIs trace their roots back to the 19th century, with the establishment of black-owned financial institutions. Throughout more than a century, the idea and mission behind these predecessors have expanded dramatically. One of the biggest changes came with the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994.This created the CDF Fund. It is used to help fund the now more than 1,000 CDIFs there are in the United States. The fund started with $50 million dollars and has grown to more than $230 million dollars. In order to become a CDFI and access that fund, a financial institution must spend at least 50% of their assets in low-income areas.These not-just-for-profit intuitions work on programs such as teaching financial literacy, credit lending and helping people create worker-owned co-ops.CDFIs rarely get much attention in the political spotlight. In the 2016 election, only two candidates addressed the issue seriously. Believe it or not, neither of them was running on the Republican ticket. Hillary Clinton, the now Democratic presidential nominee vowed to double investment into CDFIs. Her then rival, Bernie Sanders, supported a more ambitious (though not unpragmatic) plan to turn post offices into de-facto versions of CDFIs.Whether they remain as they are now, or they continue to evolve and become integrated into the post office, these types of institutions are desperately needed in the United States. They are an idea whose time has come and then been proven to be essential for more than a century.Featured image from Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Democrats Need To Mobilize, Stick Together, And Get Out The Vote – And Fast","Hillary Clinton has had a bad two weeks. Whereas it may not be her fault (rather, the fault of a bloodthirsty, spineless media), she s still suffering at the polls. Her chances of winning, all across the board, have declined. The New York Times currently gives Clinton a 73 percent chance of winning the election, down from a near 90 percent chance at the beginning of the month. Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight gives her a dismal 61 percent chance, down from a soaring 86 percent just one month ago. Hillary has taken a nose dive (10 points) in just one week alone.Florida, Ohio, Nevada and Iowa, all crucial swing states, were once comfortably in Clinton s camp. Now? They are all in Trump s camp, and continue to head in his right-wing direction.As Nate Silver puts it: Democrats should panic, if polls look like this in a week. Why? States that are also considered  safe  for democrats are becoming highly competitive:That s not to imply the events of the weekend were necessarily catastrophic for Clinton: In the grand scheme of things, they might not matter all that much (although polling from YouGov suggests that Clinton s health is in fact a concern to voters). But when you re only ahead by 3 or 4 points, and when some sequence of events causes you to lose another 1 or 2 points, the Electoral College probabilities can shift pretty rapidly. A lot of light blue states on our map have turned pink, meaning that Trump is now a narrow favorite there instead of Clinton.Look at it this way, also. Democrats rely heavily on early voter turnout. With the media overwhelmingly slamming Hillary unfairly (and giving Trump unprecedented bias), that could spell trouble for early voting gains for Democrats because the atmosphere is more unfavorable to Hillary than it is to Trump.Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming all begin early voting in September, with 11 other states (including thee swing state of Ohio) conducting early voting within a month. So in the next month, a third of the states will be heading to the polls already. And this election, early voting will play a key factor into how the nation will decide:Historically, early voting has favored the Democrats in some key states, and in 2008 35 percent of votes are cast before the election according to the Associated Press. That s up from 22 percent in 2004.This election is expected to see an uptick in early voting. Considering the GOP is beating Democrats at the registration game, Democrats need to mobilize, and quickly. Take for example:In Pennsylvania   where Democrats  registration advantage has fallen by a fifth since the 2012 election, to 915,000 voters   more than 85,000 former Democrats have become Republicans this year, almost three times the number of voters who made the opposite switch.If Hillary wants to win the election, she ll need to win Pennsylvania, as it s a safeguard if she loses Florida. Pennsylvania is one of fourteen states that doesn t allow early voting, and Hillary is holding her own due largely in part to metropolitan Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. However, one crucial demographic is becoming problematic: white, working class blue dogs who reside in the mid and western part of the state. With Republicans gaining ground in registration, Democrats should be on high alert and working diligently to register not just Democrats in the metropolitan areas, but the rust-belt towns and counties that usually lean Democratic but are turning red.Then there s the enthusiasm gap. Democrats were elated and fired up for President Obama s candidacy, and sadly, due to the media and GOP smear tactics, have turned off many of those in the Obama coalition from excitement regarding Hillary Clinton. As President Obama told black voters, he would be personally insulted if they did not show up for Hillary, who polls in the mid 90s with black voters.But like GOP registrants, there is a glimmer of hope for Democrats: Hispanic voters, who traditionally lag 20 points behind whites in voter turnout, may see an opportunity to be enthusiastic and get out to vote:Hispanics are a part of the Democratic coalition and their turnout rates have been low, about 20 points lower than whites or blacks in presidential elections. There is speculation that Trump s rhetoric could entice Hispanics to vote against him, and there is some evidence in polls that Hispanic voting enthusiasm is running higher than normal. In Georgia, Florida and North Carolina race and ethnicity are tracked on these states  voter files, so it is possible to look at the individual level data to see if Hispanics are showing up at unusually higher numbers than the past.Democrats have the chance to get out and bring back the Obama coalition to deliver a win for Hillary, but they need to act fast. Early voting is paramount to Democrats having an early lead, and mobilizing to push back against the unfair treatment of Hillary will help alleviate a bad taste in the voter s mouths heading into the November election. Having  a strong lead will also inspire Democrats to not give up and continue to push for a major blow-out on November 8th. But like everything else, Democrats have to want it.Democrats, do not get discouraged. Do not give up when the polling is bad. Do not waste your vote on a  protest  candidate. Get out, mobilize, work together, and vote for Hillary Clinton.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Reince Priebus To Top GOP: Endorse Trump Or Your Career Is Over (VIDEO),"Several top Republicans have yet to endorse Donald Trump as the GOP presidential nominee. On Sunday, Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus had some strong words for those individuals. Appearing on CBS  Face the Nation, Priebus issued a thinly veiled threat directed towards those who have yet to get on board the Trump bandwagon, which Reince described as one of the  biggest movements as far as people across this country in modern history. The right-wing reactionary movement is missing key GOP politicians such as Ted Cruz and other former presidential hopefuls. While they may not be considered a part of the #NeverTrump crowd, these GOPers have not really done much of anything to support the current Republican presidential candidate.They all agreed to support the eventual presidential nominee no matter who wins the election, and Priebus is expecting them to put party before country. We re a private party. We re not a public entity. Those people need to get on board,  Priebus told the show s host, John Dickerson.  And if they re thinking they re going to run again someday, I think we re going to evaluate the nomination process, and I don t think it s going to be that easy for them. I think these are things that our party s going to look at in the process. I think people who gave us their word, used information from the RNC, should get on board. What s interesting is that Trump has previously dragged his feet when it comes to endorsing other GOP candidates, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan. It s also interesting to note that the pledge that Priebus is referencing was reportedly designed to discourage Trump from running as an independent or on a non-establishment party campaign. It has no legal significance and is simply just a promise.The fact that Priebus, had to threaten   though he insists that his comments are not a threat top members of his Party show that the GOP is still cracking under the weight of trying to hold up Trump s campaign.

 Jan Brewer: There Were Birther Democrats ‘All Over The Country’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump and his supporters are vigorously trying to blame anyone but the billionaire conspiracy theorist Republican nominee for his birtherism. Former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer claimed on CNN this morning that there were plenty of Democrats  all over the country  that questioned President Obama s birthplace, too.Marc Morial said the birther issue  was offensive to us, it was offensive to Americans. Not so fast, you can t just sweep it under the rug. Marc Morial said that Trump  sounded like Joseph McCarthy  and added that it was a  smear campaign,  and then Brewer said it s time to move on from the subject. She actually told an African-American man that there are more important issues to talk about. Trump tried to delegitimize our country s first black president by suggesting that he s really a scary Muslim from Kenya. You can t blow that racist dog whistle any louder than that. She quoted President Obama when she said that. Obama is probably sick of discussing his birth certificate after nearly two terms in office. The President took the high road when Donald Trump took the low road on the subject.One of the CNN panelists reminded Brewer that she said years ago that the birther issue was nonsense, but  we have the Republican nominee not capable of saying it in 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015, and then says this very thing he should have said years ago. And then he starts another lie around it,  she added.Jan Brewer baffled the panel when she went on to say that for years the birther issue,  was a feeding frenzy on both sides of the aisle.  She claimed to remember that  vividly. Jake Tapper asked Brewer,  Democrats were? Brewer said  absolutely. Watch:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3peRl_7UYA]So first Donald circulated a conspiracy theory about Obama s citizenship, then he took credit for proving that the president was not born in Kenya, and then he covered that up with another conspiracy theory saying that Hillary Clinton started his first conspiracy theory. And now, Jan Brewer is blaming Democrats.Featured image via screen capture.

 Campaign Over: Gary Johnson Glad ‘Nobody Got Hurt’ In NYC Explosion (VIDEO),"Gay Johnson appeared on CNN s Reliable Sources Sunday morning where he made a gaffe that might just end his campaign. During an interview, Johnson said that he is  just grateful that nobody got hurt  during a bomb explosion in New York City Saturday night. Johnson appeared to be unaware that 29 people were injured in the blast. First of all, [I m] just grateful that nobody got hurt,  Johnson said.  Secondly, law enforcement is on the scene, responders are on the scene. If there s anything I learned having been governor of New Mexico for eight years is that these people really do care, they are really qualified. Look, we re going to find out who is responsible,  Johnson continued.  Whether it s an individual or a group, they will be brought to justice. And that is something that all of us demand. All of us! This is the second time that Johnson made an egregious error during a media appearance. Earlier in September, Johnson was questioned on how he would deal with the refugee crisis in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Johnson responded by asking  What is Aleppo?  The gaffe was pretty bad but it didn t appear to hurt him in the polls.While I would prefer (marginally so) a Johnson administration to the nightmare that a Trump administration would be, this is not the type of mistake that a serious political candidate should ever make. Leaders need to be informed about a situation in order to respond accordingly. This is information that Johnson should have been aware of.Johnson did not reach the threshold needed to in the polls to take a podium in the upcoming presidential debates. That fact made Johnson s already incredibly slim chance of actually winning the election to an impossibility.As others have noted Johnson may very well end up being the determining factor in this year s presidential election. This gaffe may very well take some of his influence away he has in determining the outcome, should it be enough for his supporters to defect to either major candidate s campaign.You can watch the video below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"September 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Campaign Manager REFUSES To Answer This Simple Birther Question,"On Sunday, Donald Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway appeared on NBC s Meet the Press. During her appearance, she was grilled about Trump s former birther stance.Trump recently denounced his birther views after weeks of being hounded by the press. Since then, the Trump campaign has tried to move past the matter. Given that Trump was one of the key propagators of the conspiracy theory, they are not going to be able to do that anytime soon.The show s host, Chuck Todd, asked Conway what made Trump come to the conclusion that President Obama was in fact born in the United States. It s a fairly straightforward question that Conway did not want to answer. You ll have to ask him that. That s a personal decision,  Conway replied.Conway then alleged that it was Hillary Clinton s aides were the ones that started the birther conspiracy. This stems from the fact that several Clinton supporters spread an anonymous chainmail around that pushed the birther conspiracy. However, no one actually knows where the origins of that email, or the conspiracy itself came from. Who cares about the Clinton incident?  Todd shot back.  Donald Trump for five years perpetuated this. This has been arguably part of his political identity for the last five years  forget the Clinton incident for a minute, why did he perpetuate it for five years? Conway then said that  It makes a huge difference who started this. We were reminding people where this started. It was used as a smear against Sen. Obama by Clinton campaign associates   and by the way, not a bunch of summer interns who just got it all wrong and were a little bit too ambitious. I understand why you re deflecting,  Todd responds.  You are deflecting. This was five years of his political identity. It s impossible to know who actually started the birther conspiracy. That s why Conway and other Republicans have begun using that talking point during interviews. While actually knowing who came up with conspiracy would be interesting for historical reasons, that information will probably never come to light. Trump and his campaign are desperate to sidestep the issue because they know that it is a major embarrassment.Propagating the conspiracy was also Trump s first major step into the political arena. The people who believe in it constitute Trump s base. Every time he speaks out against it, he is at risk of alienating the base.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"September 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Panicking As Ugly Divorce Records May Be Unsealed,"It s no secret that Donald Trump is cruel to women. Look how he describes and refers to women he doesn t like (for personal or non-personal reasons). He s cheated on two of his wives, resulting in some ugly and highly publicized divorces. But it s his 1990 divorce from his first wife, Ivana, that has people interested, and for good reason.The divorce, first filed by Ivana due to extreme cruel and inhuman treatment,  is controversial and, often times, muddy. Ivana Trump once revealed Donald Trump had raped her in a violent assault when he tore off her clothes and forced himself on her. The allegation was made in a sworn deposition by Trump, and was reported in the 1993 book Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump. Ivana Trump has since claimed that she did not mean it in  a literal or criminal sense,  but the affidavit still stands.But still, details of  cruel and inhuman treatment  lie buried in the sealed documents of the divorce, which is why the New York Times sued last month to have them unsealed. In the state of New York, all divorce records are sealed unless determined by a judge to be useful in  special circumstances  when dealing with intense public interest.Of course, given the fact that Donald Trump is running for President of the United States, and coupled with his past statements regarding women, the public does indeed have an interest in figuring out what kind of husband Donald Trump was, and how he treated his first wife. Or so the New York Times contends.But it s Donald and Ivana Trump who are panicking and scared out of their minds at what s possibly to come.Marc Kasowitz and other attorneys from the New York-based firm Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman, as well as longtime Trump Organization lawyer Michael Cohen, wrote in a  brief to the judge, Supreme Court Justice Frank Nervo:In seeking to invade the Trumps  26-year-old confidential matrimonial files, the Times and Gannett, as shown in Mr. Trump s filing in opposition to their motion, rely on entirely unprecedented and erroneous arguments that are contrary to the protections afforded by the Legislature over 150 years ago   The courts [in New York] have never overridden those protections because of a purported public interest in vetting political candidates. There is simply no importance, overriding or otherwise, to unsealing the matrimonial records of a political candidate.Well, if he s a rapist, that would be of some importance.It s also worth noting that Cohen (remember, an attorney), said in an interview regarding Ivana s rape allegation,  It is true. You cannot rape your spouse. And there s very clear case law.  The marital rape exemption law in new York was struck down in 1984, three years before Ivana alleged Trump assaulted her. As of 1993, all 50 states have criminalized marital rape, as it s seen as form of domestic violence.What s even more baffling is the Trump campaign is so desperate to keep these records sealed, they made a stab at Hillary Clinton s medical records as precedence:Secretary Clinton is not revealing her medical records, even though her medical condition is being raised as an issue in the current campaign. Nor could or should they be compelled to do so.First off, she has released them (Trump as not), and second, the campaign s candidate has repeatedly slammed Clinton for not doing so earlier   nor could or should they be compelled to do so? That s rich.Ivana Trump s lawyer, Ira Garr, filed a brief to Nervo pointing out that unsealing the records would be unfair to Ivana because she isn t running for any public office. Fair enough, but it s his second reason that should make people think  he thinks people are too stupid to care:Garr said in a brief interview Tuesday that he doesn t see how the divorce-court record would alter anyone s opinion of the real estate investor and GOP presidential nominee because people have either factored such issues into their voting decisions or don t view those points as relevant to their decision. Does anybody doubt that Donald isn t that nice to women?  Garr asked.  Could you watch his interview with Megyn Kelly and say,  He s nice to women? Considering he accused Megyn Kelly of having her menstrual cycle during a debate, no.These lawyers are just as dumb as their clients.Judge Frank Nervo has not indicated when and if he release them, but the trump lawyers  sudden legal briefs are telling that a decision could come soon.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News’ Latest Eye-Rolling Tweet Might Be The Funniest Thing On The Internet (TWEET),"There s nothing quite like hypocrisy on the grandest scale imaginable. So large, in fact, that all you can do is sit there and laugh at how absolutely ridiculous something is. This is what just happened on Twitter when they decided to call out media bias.Yes, you read that correctly, Fox News whined about media bias allegedly coming from other news organizations.Not only that, they hashtagged it with  #BiasAlert  to really add an extra layer of nauseating frosting on to the hypocrisy cake.They tweeted out:#BiasAlert: Candidates refer to NYC blast as bomb but #Trump takes brunt of media criticism https://t.co/KEYMx7ddRk pic.twitter.com/u2MkvGVoOp  Fox News (@FoxNews) September 18, 2016Let s just talk about this for a moment. In a tweet that blames other media outlets for correctly going after Trump s irresponsible reaction to a blast in New York City, they are saying that there s media bias.This tweet is the EPITOME of media bias. It is so ridiculous, in fact, that all other tweets with media bias can now be measured against this one in the future to see how biased something actually is. Not only do they display their own bias towards Trump, but they have the audacity to say  Bias Alert. That right there is hilarious and kinda sad.Fox News can, without a doubt, be called the media outlet for the Republican party. They so unapologetically swing to defend all things Republican and  conservative  that they are blind to their own reality.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons",News,"September 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 It Looks Like The Trump Campaign Just Got This Reporter Arrested,"While Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton of being crooked and freedom hating, a member of the press was arrested at a his Houston rally after simply inquiring about press credentials.Alex Thompson of Vice News was arrested at the Omni Westside hotel for  trespassing.  Thompson, inquiring as to whether or not his pending press credentials had been approved or denied, entered the hotel lobby to ask members of Trump s communications staff what the final say was.According to Vice News:A man who identified himself as a hotel manager then asked Thompson to leave and warned that he would be arrested if he did not. Roughly two minutes later, without further warning and while Thompson was waiting for a member of Trump s staff to clarify his access to the event, he was arrested by Houston Police, handcuffed, and escorted outside. Thompson spoke with his editors while handcuffed and said that he was never given any opportunity to explain himself to police.And just like that, a reporter was arrested for requesting an answer to his ability to report on the rally, which is his constitutional right.Ryan McCarthy, editor-in-chief of Vice, tweeted:Our reporter @AlxThomp was arrested today outside a Trump event   for doing his job https://t.co/kS2PG5Igyc  Ryan McCarthy (@mccarthyryanj) September 17, 2016Of course the Trump campaign denied any knowing or involvement of the incident, saying,  The campaign was not involved in this incident or aware of the details surrounding it. The event organizers were responsible for today s media presence and requested the campaign limit attendance to the traveling pool. Thompson was released on bond overnight, and the Houston police claimed that he issued an ultimatum: arrest him or leave him alone, because he is not leaving until he gets an answer, as he   a member of the press   is entitled to.Vice has hinted that their lawyers are working on getting the charges dropped.Given Trump and his campaign s hostility to the media (which includes threatening to sue the New York Times, tightening libel laws, and calling CNN panelists a bunch of losers), could having a reporter arrested seem too far out there? The answer is no.Whether or not Trump or anyone in his campaign made the call is not know. But we do know this much: the campaign had his credentials pending; he inquired but to no avail; he inquired again, and was arrested for  trespassing,  even though the event was public.Trump is no friend of the press, or the freedom of the press to report on the asinine and ridiculous things he and his supporters cough up. That should scare everyone.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"September 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Former Secretary Of Defense Has Some SCATHING Words For “Unqualified And Unfit” Trump (TWEET),"Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates has judged both Republican and Democratic residential candidates for their ideas on foreign policy, but it s clear that he only believes that there s one nominee that is  beyond repair    Donald Trump.Gates, who has served under George W. Bush as well as Barack Obama, recently published a brutal op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that examines both Trump and Hillary Clinton for their plans on handling America s challenging relations with nations like Russia, China and the Middle East.Although Clinton was nowhere near exempt from criticism, Gates saved his harshest words for her GOP rival. Gates noted that the former Secretary of State has much-discussed credibility issues apart from national security, but these also influence foreign perceptions of reliability and trust.  However, Trump is  in a league of his own  when it comes to credibility.Gates reminded Americans that Trump openly supports and shines praise on leaders like Vladimir Putin and Saddam Hussein, and is all for unethical torture practices and the killing of terrorist s families. Gates also mentioned the fact that Trump likes the idea of Japan and South Korea developing nuclear weapons. Gates said: At least on national security, I believe Mr. Trump is beyond repair. He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform. He is unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief. As soon as Gates  op-ed was discovered by Trump, the business mogul predictably went on Twitter to throw one of his infamous man-baby temper tantrums:TwitterTo challenge Trump s tweet, NPR Morning Edition reporter Steve Inskeep invited Trump to an interview about foreign policy on his show, which the Trump campaign had said they d do about 250 days ago.TwitterAs expected, the Trump campaign has now fallen silent on the subject.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"September 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Once Again Uses A Tragedy To Congratulate Himself (VIDEO),"In case you didn t know, there was an explosion in Lower Manhattan Saturday night, resulting in a reported 26 injuries. Luckily, none of those injuries are life threatening at this time. However, that does not make such an event any less frightening or tragic for New York City, or for our country. Right now, the appropriate response is to help the victims if we can, to spread only correct information, and stay informed. That isn t the response from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, though.When news of the explosion broke, Trump was speaking to a large crowd. He announced the explosion, and, just as he did after the horrific massacre at Orlando s Pulse Night Club, used the event to congratulate himself. He touts the need to  get very tough,  and sows fear. Trump says: Just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what s going on, but we are living in a time when we ve got to get very tough, folks. We ve got to get very, very tough. It s a terrible thing that s going on in our world and in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant. We re gonna end it. We re gonna end it. After that, he praised his Colorado crowd and said how awesome it was to be there, and then touted his poll numbers, saying: And a new poll from Emerson just came out and we re up four points in Colorado!

Then says he's up 4 points in new poll. pic.twitter.com/3CN20XqwmL  Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) September 18, 2016It appears that Trump is back to his old self. This is no time to be touting poll numbers or trafficking in fear. As Americans, we do not use tragic events to congratulate ourselves or to scare people into doing as we wish. This is what demagogues throughout history have done, and that is just what Donald Trump is   a dangerous, bigoted demagogue. History tells us how that situation ends.

" Trump Will Hate What Obama Just Told Black Voters, And It Could Destroy The GOP (VIDEO)","President Obama made his final appearance as the sitting president at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation s annual dinner, and made it very clear he will not be sitting on the sidelines for the coming election.The President said,  we have something to teach him  in response to Trump s claims that black voters have  nothing to lose  so they should vote for him.President Obama: ""You want to give me a good send off? Go vote!"" https://t.co/2TggidWndx https://t.co/iCke8GsuCo  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 18, 2016From the White House press pool report: But our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that is on the ballot right now. And there is one candidate who will advance those things, and there is another candidate who s defining principle, the central theme of his candidacy  is opposing those things, Obama said. I will consider it a personal insult  if African Americans sit out this election. If you want to give mea a good send off, go vote! Hope is on the ballot and fear is on the ballot too. Obama also spoke about Republican efforts to block voter turnout by requiring obstacles like voter ID, noting,  We are the only democracy in the world actively trying to discourage voting. Obama also joked with the crowd about Donald Trump finally admitting that he was born in the United States: I mean ISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change-none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate. According to the White House press pool, supporters lined up along the street chanted  four more years  as the President and First Lady left the venue.Trump has faced huge obstacles in attempting to attract black voters to his campaign. Already skeptical of Republicans, Trump has a history that turns them off. In addition to being part of a redlining effort in his father s real estate business that tried to keep blacks out of apartments, Trump also called for the execution of the Central Park Five after it was proven they were innocent, and promoted the false racist birther conspiracy up until a few months ago   even after President Obama had long since provided his birth certificate.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Is Pretending He Doesn’t Want To Sue The New York Times (TWEET),"Donald Trump reverted to his usual grouchy, unlikable self in another Twitter meltdown on Saturday, ripping into both Maureen Dowd of The New York Times and the paper itself. Dowd told CNN that Trump once told her that the violence at his rallies adds excitement, and the Times ran a separate piece on the nearly $1 billion in tax breaks Trump s real estate empire got from the State of New York. Both seem to have hurt Trump s widdle feewings.In this latest meltdown of his, he posted the following tweet:My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now), but they are watching. Really disgusting  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016That s a load of hogwash if there ever was one. First off,  irresponsible intent  isn t a crime and his lawyers ought to know that (if they don t, they re terrible lawyers). This is something that Trump himself just made up to sound smart.Besides, if it were a crime he likely would have been locked up for all eternity already.Secondly, Trump is sue-happy to the point that he often gets what he wants in business simply by threatening to sue those who don t do what he wants. He hates the press and has banned outlets from his rallies, in addition to saying he ll  open up libel laws  after he s elected so that we can sue the media and  win lots of money. This also isn t the first time Trump s lawyers have threatened to sue the Times. Earlier this year, the Times ran a story with quotes from an old girlfriend, who later claimed they misrepresented her badly. For its part, the Times issued a statement saying she was quoted accurately, fairly, and at length. Trump s lawyers withdrew their lawsuit threat.So it s not especially likely that Trump doesn t want his lawyers to sue now   it s more likely that tweet is a showy lie. He wants to make the threat, but he might want to make it look like he s got hard-hitting lawyers that are somewhat roguish, whom he has to rein in. He s conniving and his image is everything. This might make him look like he s in control.As for us, we can see right through him.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"September 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" John Boehner Has A New Job, And It’s Vile (VIDEO)","When John Boehner left Congress, he left behind a stench so bad it took a team of professionals and a hefty chunk of change to get rid of it. No, I m not talking about his obstructionism. I m talking about the fact that Boehner is a massive chain smoker, and his office reeked so bad that Paul Ryan had to have new carpets, furniture and paint in his new office.Now, Boehner has found a new home, and it can only be imagined that the entire building stinks just like Boehner s old office. He s now a Class 2 director on the board of Reynolds American Inc, the company that makes his beloved Camel cigarettes. Yes, his job will be to lobby Congress to help prevent and eliminate those pesky regulations that tobacco companies have to jump through   you know, like the ones that say the tobacco companies can t market to children, although a Boehner spokesman spun it to sound like just the opposite. RAI is striving to transform the tobacco industry through innovative strategies that include speeding the decline in tobacco use among young people and reducing the harm caused by smoking,  said a Boehner spokesman.  These are objectives Speaker Boehner supports and looks forward to helping RAI advance through his service on the board. Source: NPRHere s the video:The reality is much bleaker. There is a tiny grain of truth in the statement that fewer young people are using tobacco, but one of the things tobacco companies are trying to sell as a safer alternative to tobacco are e-cigarettes, which for children, are even worse than traditional cigarettes, just because the cartridge can be broken and children have been known to swallow toxic doses of nicotine.Not only that, tobacco companies are specifically marketing e-cigarettes to young children, often with ads touting their candy-like flavors.If you recall, Boehner stepped down from his speakership and announced that he would be leaving Congress immediately after a congressional visit from Pope Francis. He seemed to imply that the Pope had put the  pro-life  Speaker into a crisis of conscious. In truth, Republicans wanted him out, badly, but what happened to the man who claimed his life was changed after meeting the Pope?Nothing that the Pope would approve of. Smoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in this country. Nearly half a million Americans die from smoking ever year. While not as many children are picking up cigarettes, hence the panic and the hiring of Boehner, more than 3,200 new smokers each day are younger than 18. Of those, 2,100 will become addicts. This is what John Boehner is promoting. He s almost better back in Congress. At least there, he got nothing done. Now, he ll be personally responsible for the deaths of millions and he ll be pushing cigarettes on children.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"September 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Buddy Putin Once Said He Could Destroy The U.S. In Less Than A Half Hour,"Just in case anybody s wondering just how dangerous Trump s love of Putin is, here s a little reminder: When Putin was running for election in 2011, he hosted a big, lavish banquet where he spoke to a variety of leaders on a variety of topics. When he addressed the Americans there, he said that the only reason the U.S. was interested in a relationship with Moscow was because Russia could destroy the U.S.  in a half hour or less. That s according to two authors of The Russia-China Axis, who concluded from Putin s thinly-veiled threat: It would be difficult to find a statement more revealing about Putin s true position regarding the United States. This is a man that Donald Trump repeatedly praises as a strong leader, and over whom he fawns because Putin likes him. Putin and Trump are two of a kind in terms of demagoguery, but it s never been a secret that Putin isn t a fan of the U.S. It seems the only way he ll become a fan of us is if Trump is elected.Why?He likely believes he can pull Trump s puppet strings. Trump might think that Putin is just a good negotiator, but he fails miserably at understanding the naked fact that Putin sees us as his number one enemy.If Putin is actively working to undermine our democratic process (and there is credible evidence suggesting exactly that), then a President Trump is very likely to just hand us over, knowingly or unknowingly, to a hostile leader who believes he can destroy us on a whim.Russia has a squillion nuclear weapons   that s never been a secret. We have roughly 4,100 of the damn things that aren t awaiting dismantlement while Russia has roughly 2,700 in that state. In total, we have 7,100 while Russia has 7,300. However, Russia has managed to negotiate cuts in our arsenal while they work to strengthen theirs. Some reports say that their military exercises center around nuclear strikes now.In other words, their nuclear arsenal might be a bigger threat than ours, and they are more prepared for a nuclear war than we are. Compare all of that to North Korea s eight and Iran s nonexistent nuclear arsenal, and one has to wonder why our leaders seem to focus all our energy on those two countries when Russia is currently led by a man who said he could destroy us in a half hour, and we have a presidential candidate who is in love with that man.This is so frightening to many in the GOP that some feel they re in the awkward position of having to rationalize Trump s love affair with Vladimir Putin while quietly quaking in their boots. But others aren t fooled, like Lindsey Graham: Other than destroying every instrument of democracy in his own country, having opposition people killed, dismembering neighbors through military force and being the benefactor of the butcher of Damascus, he s a good guy. And the ghostwriter of Trump s best-selling Art of the Deal, Tony Schwartz: To undecided voters: Trump wants to be Putin, a despot & dictator. The world may not recover. Save your children and grandchildren. Yeah. Putin s a great guy. So s Trump. Two peas in a pod.

 WATCH: This Democrat Just Released The Most Badass Campaign Ad So Far,"Jason Kander is a Democrat running for a United States Senate seat in Missouri. The seat is currently held by Roy Blunt, a Republican. Kander, who is 35-years-old and is also Missouri s current attorney general, recently released probably the best political advertisement we will see in the 2016 election.Kander s opponent has been attacking him for supporting more effective background checks on gun sales.That was a major mistake for Blunt. That s because Kander is an Afghanistan war veteran. Which means that he knows his way around firearms, which Kander demonstrates perfectly in his campaign video. The thirty-second advertisement busts a myth that the right-wing has made about gun-law-reformers for decades   that enacting smart safety regulations is tantamount to unilateral gun confiscation.In reality, despite what the NRA would have people think, gun law reformers want to create laws that should be considered common sense. Such as say, not letting people on terrorist watch lists purchase firearms.In the ad, Kander stands in front of a table with a dissembled rifle on the table. Kander proceeds to assemble the weapon while blindfolded. While Kander assembles the rifle he says: I m Jason Kander and Senator Blunt has been attacking me on guns. Well, in the army I learned how to use and respect my rifle. In Afghanistan, I volunteered to be a gun in an unarmored convoy of SUV s. In the state legislature, I supported 2nd amendment rights. I also believe in background checks so that terrorists can t get their hands on one of these. When Kander finishes assembling the rifle, he removes his blindfold and says,  I approve this message because I d like to see Senator Blunt do this. A majority of Americans are in favor of expanding background checks. Yet, Congress has not taken action to support legislation that would create such a system. That s because the NRA is holding our Congress hostage. They donate huge amounts of moneyto political candidates. In 2016, so far the NRA has spent $825,000 dollars in campaign contributions. A paltry sum compared to the total amounts of money they have spent influencing politics. Overall, they have spent more than a quarter million dollars supporting Blunt.They also work endlessly to brainwash their supporters into thinking that all gun-reformers want to get rid of the second amendment. Which is absolutely not true. This ad effectively smashes that conflation in mere seconds.You can watch the ad below in full:https://www.facebook.com/kanderformissouri/videos/1102167116543853/Feature image from video screenshot",News,"September 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Clinton Lists The 9 Things Trump Accuses Her Of Doing – That He Actually Does Himself,"Trump s way of handling the heat is simple: deflect, and blame everything on everyone else. He is a master of pointing the finger and saying  look, they do it too!  The evidence couldn t be more clear with how he accuses Hillary Clinton of everything   from pay-for-play, to corruption, to even murder.And for some reason, the media lets him get away with it.But luckily for us (and bad for Trump once the debates come around), Hillary Clinton isn t letting him get away with anything.Sick of the never ending accusations and silence by the media elites, Clinton listed on her website nine difference instances in which Trump accused her of doing something he actually does himself. From real pay-for-play to ties to Russia, Clinton proves that it really is Trump, and not her, that is the shady candidate.Let s take a look:So there you have it. While Trump continues to accuse Clinton of everything under the sun, he himself is actually the real culprit in all of these scenarios. But because he s loud and entertaining and gets them good ratings, the media ignores the glaring contradictions and hypocrisy, and let s him a free pass.Bottom line: Trump literally does everything he accuses Clinton of doing.Once the debate season heats up, you ll see Donald Trump be put in his rightful place.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Joy Reid DESTROYS Trump Supporter Who Claims Trump’s Campaign Isn’t Racist (VIDEO),"Steve Cortes, an avid Trump supporter, appeared on AM Joy where he claimed that Donald Trump s campaign is  an incredibly non-racist campaign.  Well, any fan of the show s host Joy Reid knows that she is not going to just accept a claim like that on her show. What you seem to be saying, is that it is okay to laugh at this idea of people who are outright racists who are part of the coalition of Donald Trump,  Reid said.  You seem to be saying, we don t care, we want to ridicule the idea that this is bad, and we don t care if it grows our coalition. Cortes upset that Reid brought up David Duke support s for Trump s campaign because Trump has renounced Duke s endorsement. Cortes apparently doesn t seem to understand that Duke s endorsement itself does not necessarily matter. The fact that the white supremacist movement in the United States supports Trump because of his policy proposals and rhetoric. The only true way to actually denounce these people would be to scrap Trump s entire platform and adopt one that racists would not be fond of. That, or drop out of the race altogether.Cortes then says that compared to previous Republican elections, Trump s campaign is incredibly non-racist. I would remind you that Donald Trump, particularly compared to past Republican presidential candidates, is running an incredibly non-racist campaign,  Cortes said.  He s gone into the barrio and he is going into the inner-city and you can laugh, but we are appealing directly to people of color. The rest of the panelists on the show laughed at Cortes  assertion. Then why is it that Donald Trump is the most disliked and despised Republican candidate among people of color that we have had, probably in a generation?  Reid asked. People who say that racism is not central to this campaign: let me explain this to you,  wrtiter and journalist Tour  stated.  This is a campaign that started with birtherism, continues with the wall, we re going to ban all Muslims and we re at war economically with the Chinese. Is there any person of color who the campaign is not at war with? I can t find one! Studies have shown that roughly half of the Republican Party s membership is racist. There is no getting around that fact. Trump s campaign has appealed to that base throughout his campaign with vile, even hateful rhetoric. No matter what Trump s supporters say those are the facts.You can watch the segment below:Featured image from video screenshot",News,"September 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Maher Reads A List Of Provable Lies To Trump Campaign Manager (VIDEO),"On Friday, Donald Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher. While on the show, Maher thanked Conway for coming on the show. Maher then thanked her for  enabling pure evil.  Maher also mentioned that Trump has sued him before. A lawsuit, which a judge threw out immediately because it was bogus, as Maher explains.Maher asked Conway whether Trump had encouraged her to be on the show and she confirmed that he did. That s because, as Maher pointed out, Trump is desperately after his show s audience demographic. While Conway may have been happy to get to speak to that audience in the beginning of the segment, she certainly isn t happy now. That s because Maher confronts the only person has been so far able to  tame  Trump, as Maher puts it, and informs her that her boss is a habitual liar. I don t know anything about David Duke.  Utter lie.  Vladimir Putin and I are best friends.  He never met him. He  got a letter from the NFL,  which was proved never happened. He gave money to the veterans when he didn t.  I was against the Iraq war,  when it s on tape that he was not,  Maher says.This point becomes comedy gold later in the segment when Conway insists that she could never work for someone who lies for a living. How do you answer to the fact that this man just says whatever he wants at the moment in the moment to get whatever point he wants across regardless of the facts? Conway dodged the question and took the opportunity to posture, saying she has been with the campaign with a winning candidate.That s when Maher asks Conway: You have many children. Are you okay with what your children are going to be asking you about supporting a man, enabling a man, who did things like make fun of the handicapped and said John McCain wasn t a war hero? Conway says that she is fine with backing Trump after doing that, saying that McCain has endorsed Trump.Maher concluded the segment by asking Conway to tell Trump not to sue him anymore.I wish Maher had expanded on his question regarding Conway s children. Research has shown that Trump is having a very negative impact on children. In what has been dubbed  the Trump effect  schools are reporting an increase in bullying that targets those who are racial and religious minorities. Knowing this, I would have asked Conway if she is comfortable supporting a man whose rhetoric has been shown to be inciting racial harassment towards children.You can watch the segment below in full.https://youtu.be/CX7Yt6U08c8Featured image from video screenshot",News,"September 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jane Goodall Says Donald Trump Reminds Her Of How Chimpanzees Act To Get Attention,"The legendary anthropologist and expert on primates made some interesting remarks to The Atlantic prior to Trump officially being crowned as the Republican nominee at the GOP Convention in July.In Trump, Goodall sees a male chimpanzee trying to gain dominance by making as much noise as possible.In many ways the performances of Donald Trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals,  Goodall said.  In order to impress rivals, males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays: stamping, slapping the ground, dragging branches, throwing rocks. The more vigorous and imaginative the display, the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy, and the longer he is likely to maintain that position. Clearly, that was exactly the case within the Republican Party as Trump threw his shit at every single one of his GOP rivals and continued winning primaries in state after state despite being the most outrageous candidate in the field.Now he thinks he can do the same thing against Hillary Clinton to win the presidency in November. But first, Trump will have to debate Hillary, assuming that he doesn t pull out of the debates like the coward he is.Goodall plans to watch the debates with rapt attention because she thinks Trump will act like a chimpanzee named Mike.According to The Atlantic, Goodall said:In her book My Life With the Chimpanzees, Goodall told the story of  Mike,  a chimp who maintained his dominance by kicking a series of kerosene cans ahead of him as he moved down a road, creating confusion and noise that made his rivals flee and cower. She told me she would be thinking of Mike as she watched the upcoming debates.Indeed, Trump has made  creating confusion and noise  the centerpiece of his campaign, most recently by trying to blame Hillary Clinton for the rise of birtherism despite the fact that Hillary, nor her campaign, ever leveled such charges against President Obama. Trump has also made outrageous claims about Hillary s health and said that her Secret Service detail should disarm themselves to see how long she lasts before being killed.Trump hopes that being the loudest and most obnoxious candidate will secure victory on Election Day. But Americans really need to ask themselves: Do we want a firestarter chimpanzee at the helm or do we want a civilized human being. Do we want to revert back into acting like apes, or do we want to continue to evolve? The choice is ours.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"September 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s DEPLORABLE Fans Cheer As He Almost Calls For Hillary’s Assassination,"Donald Trump is rising in the polls, has the media wrapped around his little finger, and people are starting to take him seriously. With all these things going in his favor, with 50 days left until the election, you d think he would stick to staying on script.But, as always, he screws it up.Just hours after  denouncing  birtherism (and then falsely accusing the 2008 Clinton campaign of starting it), Trump delivered another off-color, off script speech in Miami where he (yet again) hinted at Hillary Clinton s assassination.After incorrectly claiming that Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment (which she can t do), Trump said: I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm. I think they should disarm immediately, what do you think, yes? Take their guns away, she doesn t want guns. Take them, let s see what happens to her. Take their guns away, okay. It will be very dangerous. And just like that, Trump basically called for an assassination of Hillary Clinton, and the basket of deplorables cheered like the rabid dogs they are.Just five weeks ago, Trump hinted that angry gun rights supporters could take matters into their own hands   assassinating Hillary Clinton   should she win the presidency: Hillary wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the Second Amendment people maybe there is, I don t know. After those comments were made, Trump received intense backlash from both the left and the right. Although his people maintain he was not advocating for assassination, but rather them getting out to vote, his campaign promised to stay on script the remainder of the race.Clearly they aren t following their own advice.Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head at a constituents  meeting   thus forcing her to resign from Congress   demanded Trump apologize and disavow his dangerous comments: In his more stable moments, Mr. Trump has said he regrets some of the ugly insults and dangerous threats he has leveled during the course of this campaign. We call on him to immediately renounce these comments, apologize to Hillary Clinton, and acknowledge that once again he has gone dangerously too far. If anyone knows the danger of stoking political violence, no matter how  innocent  it may seem, it s Gabrielle Giffords. Republicans, Independents, and weary Democrats should ask themselves: is this who they want representing them? A  man  who makes a casual reference to violence against Hillary Clinton?Any presidential candidate who is so cowardly he has to call on his opponent to essentially be assassinated should in no way even remotely be considered for the job. Perhaps Trump s secret service agents should have a word with the Republican candidate about jokes regarding death.When will the American people stand up and say  enough is enough.  Enough of the off-script  jokes,  enough of the blatant disregard for cordial campaigning, enough of the deplorable and reprehensible comments.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"September 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Actress Kerry Washington DESTROYS Trump For Pretending To Care About Families,"A very pregnant Kerry Washington appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday, and crushed Donald Trump in a way only a mother could.The Republican nominee is hoping that women will vote for him because he introduced a child care initiative that supposedly gives paid maternity leave to new mothers. The big problem is that Trump doesn t even offer paid maternity leave to his own employees, forcing them to use vacation days and sick days as their unpaid leave. Furthermore, Donald Trump himself is not a fan of pregnancy, once calling it an  inconvenience. So when Washington sat down at the table, she was ready to rip Trump a new one. There s been a lot of talk about it being insulting to women, but I actually think it s insulting to families   and to workers   because there s no paternity leave, there s no family leave!  Washington said.  For Hillary Clinton, these issues and these policies are not about women s policies. this is about economic policy, because we understand in this country that if families are able to take care of each other, we do better as a nation. I choose that candidate over the guy who brags about having never changed a diaper. He has literally bragged about never having changed a diaper! That s crazy. Indeed, Trump made it clear in 2005 that he has never changed a diaper for any of his five kids and claimed that it s because husbands shouldn t do that sort of thing. There s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife, and you know, there s a lot of husbands that listen to that. So you know, they go for it. If I had a different type of wife I probably wouldn t have a baby, ya know, cause that s not my thing. I m really, like, a great father, but certain things you do and certain things you don t. It s just not for me. In fact, Trump would rather not do anything to take care of children except provide money. I mean, I won t do anything to take care of them,  he added.  I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. Washington wasn t finished with Trump yet, however, going on to explain that voting for him would against our best interests. There s a bigger problem, which is right now, we are in a political climate where we are being led by the media   no offense  to vote for the loudest candidate and the meanest, bulliest candidate in the playground, and that we are voting based on a cult of personality or a cult of celebrity rather than voting in our own best interest. I think if we really look at policy, voting for Trump is voting against our best interests as Americans as workers, as people of color, as women. Not voting is voting against ourselves. She also explained why she supports Hillary Clinton. I would rather vote for the candidate who is willing to address mistakes, address issues, take responsibility, be accountable, be a part of a changed solution rather than a candidate who continues to perpetuate fear and hate in the present moment. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump can t be trusted do what he says he will do for the country when he can t even be bothered to do those things for the people who work for him.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH Rachel Maddow Tear Trump APART For Validating White Supremacists,"Rachel Maddow has a way of cutting to the point with a very sharp knife, and if the point is raw and bloody when she s done, then it deserves to be. On Friday night, Maddow discussed the dangerous, white supremacist views of the alt-right, and how they relate to Donald Trump s campaign. One side of American politics is pulling a drag bar through the sewer tank of what gets flushed out of normal politics. She s right   the fact that white supremacists that think immigration from anywhere other than Europe means white genocide are embracing Trump is extremely telling.She began this particular segment with a clip of Hillary Clinton denouncing Trump and the dangerous alt-right. Those total bigots held a press conference last week, where they discussed the need for a white homeland as though it was the most natural thing on the planet. To them, Trump is their white (emphasis on white) knight in shining armor: [Richard] Spencer [who coined the term  alt-right ] was greeted with much applause by his fans in the room. He elaborated that rather than a multicultural America, his ideal is a white empire. He described his  dream ethno-state  as  a homeland for all Europeans,  which would take an  imperial form. Here s how Trump fits into that, via Mother Jones:Spencer s ideas about race are intertwined with his support for Trump. Spencer explained that he likes Trump s immigration policy, which not only calls for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants but also reduces legal immigration into the country. (Spencer s ideal policy would also favor immigrants from Europe.) But as Spencer put it, it s Trump s more intangible qualities that make him a hero of the alt-right. To Spencer, Trump s brash style suggests a white savoir, unwilling to be bullied by the politically correct crowd. These are the people who love Donald Trump, and that s what Maddow was highlighting in her show this evening. Watch some of it below:They ve made him one of their own because, to them, he hates everyone they hate. He ll make the white race truly superior again. Note that we said  everyone;  that s not by accident. The alt-right wants an actual homeland for white people, because to them, white people are victims, and have totally not forced themselves on other cultures at all: Spencer proposed the following  mantra  for his movement:  Race is real, race matters, and race is the foundation of identity.  The ultimate ideal is that the world be divided into ethno-states so that white people could have a  homeland.' And Trump is directly feeding into that. The fact that those closest to him love Pepe the Frog a symbol co-opted by the alt-right proves that. Pepe the Frog was a symbol for, well, pretty much everything, but now white supremacists use him for their eugenics propaganda. It s sick, it s disgusting, and it needs to stop. These people need to go back to the far fringes where they effing belong.Featured image by Frederick M.

 ‘Les Deplorables’: This Entrance Proves Donald Trump Has Officially Lost His Damn Mind (VIDEO),"At this point, it is well known that there is no limit to how low Donald Trump will sink. But Friday night, he walked onto the stage and proved that he has gone completely off the deep end, all without even opening his mouth.Remember his grand WWE style entrance at the Republican National Convention? Well, that wasn t sh*t compared to his entrance on Friday night at a rally in Miami. In a sick and twisted parody of Les Miserables, the GOP nominee walked onto the stage with  Do You Hear The People Sing?  blaring across the loudspeakers and this backdrop behind him:No, this is not a joke. No, this is not satire. Yes, this really happened. Yes, this is actually real life.Since Trump has decided to embrace the term  deplorable  as an accurate description himself and his supporters, let s take another look at just who was in Hillary Clinton s now notorious  basket of deplorables,  shall we? You know, just to be grossly generalist, you could put half of Trump s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic   you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up,  Clinton said at a rally last week.Despite all the fake outrage from the right that Clinton would have the audacity to call them out for what they are,  deplorable,  Trump has now decided to go ahead and use this as another dog whistle to his white supremacist followers. I won t even take the time here to go into the irony of Trump using Les Miserables to bolster his campaign s bigoted message. Instead, I will just draw attention to the fact that Trump just walked on stage and proudly declared himself to be racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic.And without a doubt, his racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic supporters are eating it up. Which also makes it very obvious that it isn t only Trump who has lost his damn mind.Watch Trump s entrance, here:Trump walks out to Les Miserables song with  Les Deplorables  sign behind him pic.twitter.com/8FGLKL3TU5  Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) September 16, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Lawrence O’Donnell Reveals What Would Happen If Trump Retracted A Lie Per Day (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a liar. This is pretty well-established by now. But on Friday he stopped telling The Big Lie, the one that allowed him to rise to political prominence and the one upon which so much of his initial support was based: Barack Obama is not a U.S. citizen.For years, Trump has harangued the President over his birth certificate, passport, college transcripts, and anything else the billionaire could use to delegitimize the first black President of the United States. The 2016 nominee was, in effect, the leader of the  birthers,  a movement he did not start but gladly latched onto, fueled, and drove forward as he and his cohorts ineffectively but annoyingly attacked Obama.Trump offered no apology. In fact, he spent only about 20 seconds admitting that President Obama was born in the United States,  period. That was one lie. But what if Trump were to retract a lie per day? Could he do it? Would he even live long enough to do so? MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnell tackled the issue on Friday. Pointing out that Trump, via his doctor s shady letter The Donald allowed  Dr. Oz  to look at, was willing to lie about a single inch   adding one inch to his actual height to narrowly avoid being classified as medically obese. Let s just assume Donald Trump is much healthier than he looks. Let s even assume he s taller and thinner than he really is,  O Donnell says, deciding to estimate that Trump would live longer than his father. If Trump lived until 95 years old, he will be around for  another 9,131 days. If Trump were to retract one lie per day for the rest of his life,  he can retract 9,131 lies,  O Donnell points out, but there s a problem. In retracting The Big Lie, he told two more: that Hillary Clinton started the  birther  rumors, and that Trump stopped them through his racist badgering of President Obama. If he does it the way he did it today, the lies of Donald Trump will live after him because as he retracted one lie today he told two more,  O Donnell says.  I think we know that Donald Trump isn t going to retract a lie every day. I think we know that Donald Trump is going to continue to lie every day.  Then he brought it home: I think we know that there is nothing too small for Donald Trump to lie about, including that extra inch of height he decided he needed this week. He will lie about an inch. I think we know there s nothing too big for Donald Trump to lie about, nothing too big, nothing too solemn He will lie about anything. And so I think we know that long after he s gone, long after his name has disappeared from buildings, the lies of Donald Trump will live after him.

" After Trump Attacked Obama, George Takei Stepped In And Tore Him A New One (TWEETS)","Who doesn t love George Takei   well, aside from Donald Trump at the moment. The Star Trek actor noticed that The Donald attacked President Obama   a man Trump admitted on Friday for the first time to be a legitimate American citizen   for campaigning for Hillary Clinton and, well, let s just say Mr. Sulu wasn t willing to let it slide. Why isn t President Obama working instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton?  Trump tweeted Tuesday.On Friday, Takei responded, and not in a way that is likely to get him invited to The Donald s home for dinner. As Commander-in-Chief, he is sworn to protect us from threats both foreign and domestic,  Takei wrote.  You, sir, are the latter. Trump as a domestic threat is not exactly off-base. In fact, analysts have determined that the 2016 GOP nominee is a  global  threat. They say that he poses a greater risk than terrorism   coincidentally, one of Donald Trump s favorite fear-mongering talking points.It isn t just President Obama s duty to defend us against threats like Trump. It s all of ours., and we have the most powerful weapon available: the ability to vote. The ability to, as a nation, say  no  to everything Trump represents.Be sure to head to the polls on November 8   the future of our nation depends on it.Featured image via Getty Images (Matt Hayward)/screengrab",News,"September 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH This WWII Vet Shame Trump To Hell And Back For Insulting POWs And The Military,"When Trump insulted John McCain for having been captured in Vietnam by saying,  He s not a war hero. He s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren t captured, okay?  he insulted and hurt our entire military, and he especially hurt former POWs. He showed no respect for the military whatsoever during that interview.Nobody, except maybe Trump, can deny that being a POW is a harrowing and very traumatic experience. Many, many vets never recover from it, even if they have access to the best help available. Joel Sollender, who served in the U.S. Army in WWII and was captured by the Nazis in 1944, is not thrilled with Trump at all, to put it very mildly. This is what his experience as a prisoner of the Nazis was like: It was mainly hunger and cold, and worrying whether the Germans were going to hurt us again My war is 70 years ago, and yesterday. Watch the whole emotional, powerful video below (and have some tissues ready):On National Prisoners of War Remembrance Day, a POW shares what it means when Trump insults veterans. pic.twitter.com/0dVB5B0gbC  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 16, 2016POWs never stop fighting the war (hell, many vets in general never stop fighting the war), and Sollender s tears during this video prove that beyond doubt. For Trump to insult John McCain because he was a POW was for him to slam a knife into the minds, hearts and souls of every POW we ve ever had.Sollender s tears, and his heartfelt statement, are why Trump ought to be ashamed of himself for what he s said and done with the military. It s not just the statement about McCain. It s also his comparing his sexual conquests to serving in Vietnam (really?!), and saying being sent to a wealthy boarding school makes him feel like he served. He repeatedly attacked a Gold Star family. He got multiple draft deferments during Vietnam. He thinks he can speak to what all those servicemembers experienced because he s slept around and been to a military boarding school?All of that is a hard whack across the face with a two-by-four.Someone who wants to be President of the United States has to have a lot more respect than this. Trump has less than none   it is, and always will be, about his own self-aggrandizement.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"September 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump From 2011 Was DEFINITELY Sure Obama Wasn’t Born In The USA,"With absolutely no shame or apology, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump finally admitted to the American public that President Obama was, in fact, born in the United States of America despite his repeated efforts to prove otherwise. It s now not as politically convenient for Trump to still push this issue considering he now has to try to win over the opposing side of the topic.Trump said: President Obama was born in the United States. Period. Now, we want to get back to making America strong and great again. Profound, really. And absolutely pathetic.Here s the thing, though, Trump is full of absolute horseshi*t because he was the Birther-in-Chief back half a decade ago, even going so far as to claim credit for the fact that Obama released his birth certificate. And even after that, Trump still had his many doubts over its authenticity.There s even video of him from 2011 stating how much he believes this is a very valid issue that needs to be looked into. He even went so far as to say calling those who wanted to see the birth certificate  birthers  was  derogatory  because they re actually  on to something. And ever the political opportunist, he said: People love this issue   especially in the Republican Party. So, when you hear Trump say that  President Obama was born in the United States. Period,  remember what he really thought and likely still thinks. You can also tell he s doing it for pandering purposes because he ended his announcement with his damn campaign slogan.Those who haven t caught on to how absolutely smarmy Trump is, need to wake up and wake up fast.Kyle Griffin of MSNBC s Last Word posted the video on Twitter:Trump on birtherism in 2011: ""People love this issue   especially in the Republican Party."" https://t.co/6I6WKsC4DI pic.twitter.com/6eza8loaoN  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 16, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Entire Congressional Black Caucus Just Stomped All Over Trump’s Birther Remarks (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has finally been convinced that President Obama was indeed born on U.S. soil, or at least that s what he said during a press conference on Friday. What he didn t say was that he was sorry for being a champion of the  birther  movement from the very beginning. Not only did he fail to apologize, he also told an outright lie, claiming that it was Hillary Clinton who first started the rumors of this racist conspiracy theory.On Friday afternoon, the Congressional Black Caucus held a press conference of their own and stomped all over Trump s decision not to apologize. The CBC slammed Trump for living a  life of bigotry  and denounced the GOP nominee as  a two-bit racial arsonist  and a  disgusting fraud. Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) said that Trump has gone way past the racial dog whistling that has been a plague upon American politics for years and is all out  howling. One of the things that we are all used to in this business is dog whistles,  he said.  But the thing that we re not used to  are the howls of wolves. These are howls, these are not whistles. These are in-your-face kinds of efforts on the part of one man  in order to heap indignities on the President of the United States. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) had even harsher criticisms, accusing Trump of living  a life of bigotry. He has lived a life of bigotry,  she said.  If you view America as a land of value and equality and justice, this man cannot be elected. We as African Americans have had enough. He has debased this election, but more importantly, he has disgraced himself in his lack of respect for the President of the United States of America. Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) condemned Trump for the never ending stream of lies that come out of his anus-shaped mouth. This is not the first time he has lied   he continues to lie,  Meeks fumed.  He s lied and he s divided this country enough. He lied about Muslims, saying he saw thousands of them [celebrating] when the World Trade Center went down. He s lied about Mexicans, he s lied about women, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus are not going to take it anymore. Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-NC) denounced the Republican nominee nothing more than a  disgusting fraud,  and Rep. Hakeem Jefferies (D-NY) called Trump out as  a two-bit racial arsonist.

 OOPS: Trump’s Hotel Offers Qurans And Is Furnished With Goods Not Made In The USA,"Donald Trump wanted the press to tour his brand new hotel in Washington D.C., so they did and discovered that he is truly a giant hypocrite.The Republican nominee was hoping to use the press corps as his own personal team of promoters but photographers were the only ones allowed to follow Trump inside the building. And that many cameras came in mighty handy as they captured how big of a liar Trump is when he claims he will  make America great again. American Bridge used their exploration time to find out how Trump furnishes the rooms in his hotel and the answer is definitely not with the help of workers in the United States.As it turns out, the hotel that is supposed to represent the United States capitol around the world is filled with products made in China and the Philippines among multiple other countries.Here s a bunch of photos via Twitter showing how Trump relies heavily on cheap foreign labor.A very classy gold lamp in the new DC Trump Hotel, which just happens to have been made in China, not in the USA. pic.twitter.com/wZAloIuNEu  American Bridge (@American_Bridge) September 16, 2016 This dresser was made in the Philippines, far and away from the USA. pic.twitter.com/MtU7mx9dfc  American Bridge (@American_Bridge) September 16, 2016The king-sized beds inside the suites at the new DC Trump Hotel were   you guessed it   not made in the USA. pic.twitter.com/rH3FBLmjJy  American Bridge (@American_Bridge) September 16, 2016 Even these Trump Hotel branded umbrellas are made in China, not here in the U.S.. pic.twitter.com/aw4q5nj8H8  American Bridge (@American_Bridge) September 16, 2016Inside the Trump Hotel in Washington, DC: bedding made in China, not the USA. pic.twitter.com/lmI5MpBKm4  American Bridge (@American_Bridge) September 16, 2016Did you catch all of that, Trump supporters? Your hero claims that he is going to  make America great  but he can t even be bothered to support American workers by furnishing his hotels with American-made products.And if your blood is not boiling from that revelation, just wait until you read about what Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold discovered while experiencing what it is like to be a guest in Trump s hotel.Even as Donald Trump vilifies Muslims all over the world and describes Islam as a violent threat to the United States, he actually offers guests a Quran if they want one complete with a prayer rug and a compass directing them towards Mecca. According to Fahrenthold, it was incredibly easy.  Minutes after my call to housekeeping, a pleasant woman arrived with a copy of  The Glorious Qur an  in Arabic and English, along with a brown prayer rug and a compass pointing in the  direction of al Kabaa  in Mecca,  he wrote.When a presidential candidate is using foreign labor to make his products at will while claiming that he will  make America great  that a problem because it means Trump is part of the problem that many of his own supporters are complaining about, the fact that American companies are moving jobs overseas and giving them to foreigners. If Trump really cared about American workers, he would employ them to make his products, not the Chinese.And while Americans have freedom of religion in this country and can practice whatever religion they want, Trump s hotel offering the Quran is also damaging to his own image because he has worked hard to convince his supporters that Islam is an evil religion. If Islam is so evil, why offer the Quran to any hotel guest who requests one?Clearly, Trump s supporters are too blind to see that their candidate is a con artist who is duping them.Featured Image: Getty Images ",News,"September 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: These White Trump Supporters Call Black People Lazy And Then Get Their A**es Handed To Them,"Not long before Donald Trump pathetically admitted that President Obama was born in the United States, two of his white supporters stood outside the Republican nominee s new Washington D.C. hotel and claimed that black people don t work as hard as white people.And that was an incredibly bad idea considering they were standing in a city that would not exist without the back-breaking labor of slaves who built many of the buildings around the city, including the White House.So when these two Trump supporters ran their mouths, Carlos Maza of Media Matters starting filming them just as a black man rode up on his bicycle and informed them of just how wrong they are. You see these buildings down here? Black people built the buildings on slave labor,  he said using Georgetown University as an example.  So a lot of black people have residual anger for their ancestors building this country as free labor. Indeed, white racists would rather pretend black people had nothing to do with constructing our nation s capitol rather than acknowledge that they played a major role.But the man was not finished schooling Trump s supporters. As soon as a white person steps into America, they have an advantage just by being white,  the man pointed out before going on to explain that systemic racism has been built into the system.The Trump fans tried to change the topic by claiming that thousands of Europeans have been killed by Muslims, which is incorrect. Hundreds of Europeans have been killed by terrorists, not true practitioners of Islam.A white people standing by the black man then asked the Trump duo if they have really ever experienced discrimination and they admitted that they haven t.Here s the video via Twitter.Here s a Trump supporter getting schooled on systemic racism after suggesting white people work harder: pic.twitter.com/gbHPkT4A2o  Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) September 16, 2016And yet Donald Trump wonders why black people don t want to vote for him.Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 New Trump Advisor Wants Women To Have Rapist’s Baby – Even If It Kills Her (AUDIO),"Donald Trump might try to tell American voters that he  cherishes  women, but his long, ongoing history of misogyny and oppressive policies prove that the exact opposite is true   and one of his latest moves has just verified this fact even more.The Republican nominee recently made anti-abortion Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, one of his top domestic policy advisors. Dannenfelser is going to champion Trump s new  pro-life coalition , which Trump just announced while also making several statements about all the misogynistic things he s going to do as President of the United States.While introducing his coalition, Trump also promised that he would get anti-abortion justices into the U.S. Supreme Court, nix funding to Planned Parenthood, promote the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and make sure that federal funds couldn t go toward abortion.It should be noted that Dannenfelser was absolutely against Trump at first, and in the beginning of the year had begged Iowa voters to vote for anyone but the business mogul. However, once The Donald was nominated and demonstrated how extreme his views were, Dannenfelser was more than happy to make the pro-life case for Trump.  Without a doubt, she was probably tickled pink when Trump said that women should be  punished  for having abortions a few months ago.Dannenfelser s involvement in Trump s campaign should terrify women and anyone who cares about them   she not only holds some of the most extreme views on abortion and women s health, but opposes women getting abortions in case of rape and incest, as well as cases in which a woman s health is at risk in carrying out a pregnancy. Really, you can t get more anti-woman than forcing a woman to die or be constantly reminded of a traumatic, horrifying experience in order to carry out a pregnancy.Dannenfelser is also massively against Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides safe, accessible and affordable healthcare to millions of women. She even believes that the organization is  sexist  because it primarily focuses on women s health. In an interview, she said: I love men! What about men s health? I mean, do we have anything to say about men s health and the particular health problems that men have? Do we ever talk about the  men s gap  when we re moving into an election? She s an absolutely nutcase and should not be allowed to have any effect on policies. To show just how dangerous Dannenfelser is, here are some recordings of her talking about Planned Parenthood and abortion, via Right Wing Watch:Featured image via WPA Pool and Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"September 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: President Obama Doesn’t Give A F*ck About Donald Trump’s Birther Annoucement,"President  Zero F*cks Left  Obama strikes again.Donald Trump addressed his leading role in the birther conspiracy regarding President Obama s birth certificate on Friday, but President Obama isn t impressed.On Thursday, the Republican nominee refused yet again to answer whether he believes that President Obama was born in Hawaii, telling the Washington Post,  I ll answer that question at the right time. I just don t want to answer it yet. Following the interview, Trump s campaign issued a disgusting statement making Donald Trump look like a hero while painting Hillary Clinton as the villain in the story. In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised. The problem is that Hillary and her campaign had nothing to do with the birther conspiracy. As Politifact pointed out when it debunked Trump s claim last year, it was a mere volunteer who started the conspiracy via email. No campaign official, nor Hillary Clinton herself, ever questioned President Obama s citizenship.Donald Trump, however, engaged in a vicious racist witch hunt over President Obama s birth certificate. Trump constantly claimed that President Obama was not an American and that he was born in Kenya. Of course, Trump was utterly humiliated by President Obama when he released his full birth certificate to the public for all to see, even though he did not have to do so.But Trump has refused to personally acknowledge that President Obama is the legitimate Commander-in-Chief and has never apologized for his attacks.On Friday, Trump finally acknowledged that President Obama was born in America, but still didn t apologize. President Barack Obama was born in the United States,  Trump said before adding,  Period. But it doesn t matter what Trump says because President Obama doesn t give a damn about what Trump has to say.When asked about Trump s upcoming announcement prior, President Obama slammed Trump and his birtherism. I m shocked that a question like that would come up at a time when we ve got so many other things to do   well, I m not that shocked actually. It s fairly typical. We got other business to attend to. I was pretty confident about where I was born. I think most people were as well an my hope would be that the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that. Here s the video via Twitter.Obama:  I was pretty confident about where I was born. I think most people were as well.  https://t.co/R7dhUtPg4e https://t.co/HclWVwzYZw  CNN (@CNN) September 16, 2016It s not enough for Donald Trump to acknowledge the truth. He needs to man up and apologize for leading a persecution effort that did much damage and divided this country, especially if he wants any African-Americans to even consider voting for him in November.Featured image via Pete Souza/White House ",News,"September 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jimmy Fallon Tested Donald Trump’s Hair And It Was Just GROSS (VIDEO),"Donald Trump gets a lot of attention for his orange skin and tiny hands, but his most memorable asset is definitely his strange, yellow, combed-over, straw-like hair.Trump s hair has had America mystified for a while, with many claiming that it is a wig or that the Republican nominee uses weaves. Recently, Trump s hair made headlines after it was discovered that The Donald keeps his hair in place with bobby pins. Last night, Jimmy Fallon, host of The Tonight Show, tried to get to the bottom of this phenomenon when he had Trump on his show.After Trump denied that he knew Russian President Vladimir Putin, Fallon asked Trump to fulfill a special request of his. Fallon asked,  Can I mess up your hair? Trump cringed at first, but Fallon promised to  be gentle.  After squirming around in his seat for a few moments, the Republican nominee eventually said: The answer is yes. But the people in New Hampshire where I m going to be in about an hour from now, I hope they re going to understand. Trump then cozied up to Fallon, who reached across his desk and aggressively ran his fingers through Trump s golden strands. Trump s hair flew in all directions, and his scalp was exposed at one point. Trump tried to smile during this, but you could tell he didn t enjoy it by how quickly he tried to put his hair back in place after Fallon was finished. The Associated Press reported that Trump wouldn t let the press take photos of him after Fallon messed up his combover.You can watch Fallon satisfy his curiosity below:Fallon does look like he s having fun, but when you focus in on this one part, it just starts to get disturbing. No one knows just what is in Trump s hair, but Fallon is a brave soul for wanting to find out.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Joy Reid Points Out That Trump Doesn’t Have The Balls To Bully His Targets In Person,"Ever notice that Donald Trump is more than willing to attack people when they aren t around, but cowardly tucks his tail between his legs when he is face-to-face with them? Joy Reid certainly noticed.During an appearance on the Rachel Maddow Show on Thursday night, Reid pointed out that although Republican nominee Donald Trump brags about being tough when he is bullying people, he acts like a total coward when the people he is trying to bully are in the same room with him.To make her case, Reid brought up the fact that despite Trump declaring that Mexico will pay for his ridiculous wall he was timid during his meeting with the Mexican president. The bully instantly became the coward and it became clear that Trump only pretends to be tough in front of his own supporters.The fact that Trump resumed his pretended toughness and bullying towards Mexico only when he returned to the United States to deliver a speech in Arizona is proof that Trump is all talk and no walk.Furthermore, even though he trashed the black Flint pastor who shut him down during a speech that was becoming too political, he only did it on Fox News. He didn t dare challenge the pastor to her face in front of a crowd of a African-Americans. Once again, the bully shrunk into the coward he is. Donald Trump the blusterer is not the same guy when he is in front of the audience he is insulting when he is in front of the Mexican president,  Reid said.  When he is confronted by anyone, when he is confronted, he backs down and then turns around and tells a story about how tough he was. The more he puts himself in front of audiences of color, the more he shows off he is passive and aggressive. He is only aggressive when he is not in the presence of the person he is bullying. When he gets in front of the person that he previously insulted, he becomes incredibly passive. Here s the video via VidMe.Now that it s established that Trump is a coward, it ll be fun to watch how he reacts when it comes time to debate Hillary Clinton face-to-face. Because he has been bullying her the most.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Shows Amazing Disrespect For Media, Brags About Holding Rally Without His Press Corps","During presidential campaigns, it is pretty standard procedure for there to be a press corps that travels with the major party candidates. However, last night, Donald Trump s press corps was late getting to his rally. Instead of doing what any normal, reasonable candidate would do and telling the crowd to wait patiently for the press to arrive, Trump held the rally without them. They got there 3 minutes and 28 seconds before the rally ended. As if that weren t bad enough, Trump actually bragged about snubbing the press, and mocked them for their travel issues: I have really good news for you. I just heard that the press is stuck on their airplane, they can t get here. I love it. They re trying to get here now, they re going to be about 30 minutes late. They called us and said,  Could you wait?  I said,  Absolutely not, let s get going.   The media members on Twitter were not going to let Trump and his campaign get off that easy, though. They took to Trump s own favorite social media platform and slammed the Trump campaign for allegedly screwing around with their travel situation, so that they would miss the rally. They also blasted the candidate himself for not having the same sort of official press pool that Trump s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton   and, indeed, every presidential candidate in modern history prior to Donald Trump   has. Here are just a few of those tweets, via The Hill:Trump doing this rally without his traveling press corps even here is an absurd joke.

Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) September 16, 2016This is disgraceful, but hardly surprising. Trump hates the press. In fact, he hates them so much that he has actually banned a multitude of media outlets from having press credentials to cover his rallies, just because he doesn t like what they have to say about him. This is just another new low for Donald Trump and his travesty of a campaign. Hopefully, the media keeps hounding him, and treats him just as badly as he treats them.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images",News,"September 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Campaign Issues Grossly Racist Statement Regarding Birther Conspiracies,"The Trump campaign is definitely a racist one, because the guy at the helm of the whole thing, Donald Trump, is a flaming racist. After all, as we all know, Donald Trump s first entrance into mainstream American politics was his very public leading of a charge to prove that President Obama was not born in this country. That issue keeps coming up now, during this campaign, because Trump s surrogates have been all over the television airwaves insisting that he is no longer a birther. However, when Trump himself was asked by the Washington Post whether or not he actually believes that the President is an American, he refused to answer, just giving the standard answer that he no longer discusses the issue.Well, seeing that things were about to get ugly surrounding this, Trump s campaign issued a gross, racist statement full of self-congratulations and outright lies, as if Trump s questioning of the president s birth was in any way a service to the country or in any way appropriate. The statement begins by refusing to admit any wrong doing on the part of Trump and his fellow birthers, and instead suggesting that Trump s racist  show me your papers  campaign was somehow the right thing to do: In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised. Then, Trump spokesman Jason Miller, the despicable goon behind this travesty of a statement, closes the whole thing off by acting like the public questioning of the origins of the first black American president is some kind of golf course deal Trump closed: Inarguably, Donald J. Trump is a closer. Having successfully obtained President Obama s birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States. No, you guys aren t getting off this easy, Miller. The only acceptable response here is to have your candidate say, FROM HIS OWN MOUTH, that he knows that he was wrong, that he is sorry, and that President Obama is an American and a legitimate president. Nothing less will do. Further, you will have to retract this deplorable statement, and admit that everything you have said here is awful, that it was NOT Hillary Clinton s campaign who started or led the birther movement, and that it was Donald Trump himself who gave it legs.I won t hold my breath on any of that, though. After all, Hillary was right: You folks really are a basket of deplorables   and you just got even deplorable with this statement.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Hillary Talks Taco Trucks, SHREDS Trump, And The Crowd Goes WILD (VIDEO)","Hillary Clinton brought the house down at a gala event held by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute in Washington, D.C. Speaking after President Obama, Clinton referenced the verbal abuse and indignities targeted towards Latino Americans by the anti-immigrant Trump campaign.Then as an aside, Clinton said,  I personally think a taco truck on every corner sounds absolutely delicious,  and the audience went wild.Clinton: ""I personally think a taco truck on every corner sounds absolutely delicious"" https://t.co/UYpqI3w42L https://t.co/zTBXjkWoAg  CNN (@CNN) September 16, 2016The comment was in reference to a statement by a Trump campaign surrogate representing  Latinos for Trump,  in an appearance on MSNBC s All In. Marco Gutierrez stunned guest host Joy Reid, with its insensitivity. My culture is a very dominant culture,  the Mexican-born Marco Gutierrez said on MSNBC s  All In With Chris Hayes.   It is imposing and it s causing problems. If you don t do something about it, you re going to have taco trucks on every corner. Gutierrez was widely ridiculed, and many on social media like Twitter pointed out that in fact they would love to have a taco truck nearby   tacos are one of the most popular food items in the United States, as the ubiquitous Taco Bell chain would indicate.Democrats took the absurd taco truck comment and began using it to make fun of the Trump campaign. In some locations, taco trucks have now been used as part of voter registration drives in order to get new voters to the polls in November.Trump s anti-immigrant campaign, specifically targeted at Latino immigrants, is expected to prompt an increase in voter registration and participation within the Latino community. The fastest growing ethnic demographic in the United States, Latinos were once seen by the Republican Party in the era of George W. Bush as a route to electoral dominance. Since then, the GOP has instead embraced a hard-right nativist stance, opposing immigration reform even when it has strong popular support.By contrast, Democrats have now completely taken up the mantle of being pro-immigrant.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Sticks To Racist Birther Conspiracy Theory, Won’t Admit Obama Born In USA","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump refused to admit that his belief and promotion of the racist and inaccurate birther conspiracy theory was wrong. The candidate doubled down on the false idea that has been promoted by conservatives for almost a decade now in an interview with the Washington Post:In the interview, conducted late Wednesday aboard his private plane as it idled on the tarmac here, Trump suggested he is not eager to change his pitch or his positions even as he works to reach out to minority voters, many of whom are deeply offended by his long-refuted suggestion that Obama is not a U.S. citizen. Trump refused to say whether he believes Obama was born in Hawaii. I ll answer that question at the right time. I just don t want to answer it yet,  Trump said.When asked about claims in the media from campaign manager Kellyanne Conway that he is no longer a birther, Trump told the paper,  It s okay. She s allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on other things. He added,  I don t talk about it anymore. Trump has been promoting the birther conspiracy since 2011, and has never renounced it in the ensuing 5 years. He is on the verge of 2,000 straight days of supporting the conspiracy.President Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. His birth there has been certified at the federal level when he was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004 and when he was elected President of the United States in November 2008.Despite this, as the first black president in U.S. history, conservatives have consistently pushed the idea that Obama is not a natural-born citizen and instead was born in Kenya, where his father is from. The story is completely false, but has been a running theme in conservative politics.Trump was the most prominent and well-known person pushing the conspiracy theory, and even since running for president, has never renounced nor condemned it.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Columnist Wins The Internet With Priceless Answer To Hillary-Hater’s Silly Question (TWEET),"Rex Huppke, of the Chicago Tribune, is not exactly known for his formality or reverence toward pretty much anything. He also voices a lot of support for Hillary Clinton in his columns. There are probably a lot of readers who take him to task for that, but one apparently stood out to him, and he just had to highlight it on Twitter.This person asked,  Rex, are you being paid by the Clinton Crime Family Foundation? Here s Huppke s answer:Reader email:  Rex, are you being paid by the Clinton Crime Family Foundation? My response: pic.twitter.com/32XXb2TgRe  Rex Huppke (@RexHuppke) September 15, 2016Well, that s pretty much all of the right s major conspiracy theories and fear-filled talking points right there. He did forget the one where Hillary and Obama are coming to take everyone s guns, but that can be overlooked. The  Hail Hydra!  finishes this answer off with a nice, neat little bow.There s nothing the Hillary-haters love more than a good conspiracy theory. Can t find solid evidence that she s a criminal? It s because she and her husband have paid everyone off. She s coughing and has pneumonia? She s covering up a brain tumor, brain damage and Parkinson s, if she s not outright dead and has a body double doing her appearances for her. People disappear out of the public eye? Obviously, Hillary had them murdered.She s close to her assistant, Huma Abedin, so they must be secret lesbian lovers. And of course, the conspiracy-mongers are still Benghazhingly Benghaziing their Benghazist Benghazis, which spawned the entire email scandal, which is another conspiracy theory of its own.A lot of this is being fueled by Donald Trump himself, because he actually encourages this type of thinking among his loyal subjects. He loves conspiracy theories too   he s the one who put the birther movement into the spotlight. He also claimed that Ted Cruz s father may have helped assassinate John F. Kennedy. One of his favorite phrases seems to be,  Something s going on,  and he declares loudly that we must find out what it is, which adds fuel to the fire.While it s not clear whether Huppke responded to a Trumpkin or a left-wing Hillary-hater, the truth is that the line between the two is increasingly blurred. Huppke replied to that conspiracy-filled question in the only way that works.Featured image via Twitter",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Libertarians Want Security Briefings – Maybe Then Gary Johnson Would Know What Aleppo Is,"Libertarians are convinced that their presidential ticket should be getting security briefings too, just like the Democrats and the Republicans. Why? Because they seem to think there is some possible scenario where they could come out on top in November.Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton began receiving security briefings shortly after they officially became the nominees for their respective parties. Apparently, poor Gary Johnson is feeling left out.Even though it is uncommon for third party candidates to get these kinds of briefings, it wouldn t be a first. The last third party candidate to receive security briefings was John Anderson, an Independent, in 1980. And now, the Libertarian Party thinks that Johnson and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, should be eligible to receive security briefings, too.Libertarian National Chairman Nicholas Sarwark wrote a letter to the General Service Administration (GSA) on Thursday, arguing that the Libertarian candidates should be getting national security briefings since they are on the ballot in all 50 states. Even the federal government is in the business of attempting to pre-select voters  choices for President and Vice-President. Three tickets will be on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, but only two are receiving taxpayer-funded national security briefings. That is just wrong, and we urge the GSA to provide the same information to Governor Johnson that is being given to Mr. Trump and Sec. Clinton. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 makes it so that all presidential candidates are able to receive security briefings, including third party candidates. However, the law also says that the candidates must have a  significant level of public support  in national polls and need to be  realistically  thought to have a chance at winning the presidency.Even though Johnson s name will be on the ballot in all 50 states, he s only polling at 8.3 percent. Which is not enough  public support  to get him onto the debate stage, let alone the White House. So I m not sure how  realistic  the possibility of a Johnson presidency actually is.On the other hand, perhaps a national security briefing or two would be good for Johnson. Maybe they could tell him what the heck Aleppo is.Featured image via George Frey/Getty Images",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Tidbit Buried Inside Trump’s ‘Medical Report’ Proves He’s Paranoid As F*ck,"On Thursday, Donald Trump appeared on the Dr. Oz Show for what was basically a scripted series of softball questions. He was armed with a doctor s report from his already suspect doctor, Dr. Harold Bernstein, who months ago made the ridiculous assertion that Trump would be the  healthiest individual ever elected. This time, the report was a bit more detailed, but who knows if it s accurate. It showed his cholesterol and blood pressure as normal. He also had high hormone levels (I m sure Trump wanted that included) and for the most part, things are good, according to Trump s doctor, but he is overweight. In other words, it was a pretty boring report, except for one tiny little tidbit that was barely mentioned by any media sources. Donald Trump is nuts.Now, I m not a psychologist and I ve never met the man, so that s why I ve used the very non-clinical word of  nuts,  but trust me when I say he s Howard Hughes nuts. He s Kim Jon-Un nuts. He, like so many dictator wannabes, is paranoid as f*ck!Trump loves fast food and ironically despises finger food. McDonald s is his favorite. He loves fast food because  at least you know  what s in it? Really? What exactly is in a McDonald s hamburger?Per an audience member at Dr. Oz taping with Trump, he said he likes fast food because  at least you know what they are putting in it.  Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) September 14, 2016He also thinks that his gesticulating at campaign events counts as exercise.Back to the fast food. He might  know what s in it,  but he s really afraid of what people might put in it if they know it s for him.Trump admitted to Oz that he does eat a fair amount of fast food when he s on the road campaigning, and that the person who picks it up is told not to tell the restaurant it is for him because he worries the food may be tampered with.Source: WHIOHitler also felt his food would be tampered with. In fact, that seems to be a common theme among dictators. Hitler hired a team of 15 food tasters. If, after 45 minutes, the tasters were still alive, Hitler would eat. Trump didn t mention whether he has his staff taste his food but it s not even unheard of among recent U.S. Presidents. It s reported that Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush had food tasters. Fox also tried to make it seem as if Obama does, while there s no evidence. Sarah Palin once suggested that Trump get a food taster; at least we think she did. Maybe that s Chris Christie s job.Maybe Trump isn t paranoid as much as being realistic.

 Elizabeth Warren Has Found BREATHTAKING Hypocrisy In FBI’s Treatment Of Hillary’s Emails,"Buckle up. Elizabeth Warren, continuing her crusade for the little guy, wrote a letter to FBI director James Comey over their transparency with Hillary s emails, because they didn t have that same transparency when investigating the big banks. In fact, they usually don t release anything when there s no indictment. They changed their standards for releasing information with Hillary, and Warren wants to know why that same standard can t be used on Wall Street executives. Your recent actions with regard to the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provide a clear precedent for releasing additional information about the investigation of the parties responsible for the financial crisis These new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals. If Secretary Clinton s email server was of sufficient  interest  to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency. She s more than right; if Hillary s emails are of sufficient interest to release as much information as possible, then why isn t the information on those who have been proven to cause harm to millions of Americans by crashing the economy of the same interest? It should actually be of bigger interest than the witch hunt against Hillary.The FBI initially released information in response to several FOIA requests from the press, and sent more material to Congress. However, they didn t send over every last, little, tiny bit. The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), incensed that they d spurn him like that, subpoenaed the full file earlier this week.Republicans all over Congress are pitching a hell of a tantrum over the FBI not releasing every last scrap of paper, but they really couldn t care less that the FBI didn t release anything after the Department of Justice decided not to prosecute eleven bankers that had a hand in destroying the economy. Why?Simple. When it s Hillary Clinton, everything has to be changed. She must be guilty of something; Republicans and Hillary-haters know things. When it s people who actually harmed America, though? Meh. Not that important why nobody was prosecuted. Here s hoping that Warren s letter has an impact on Comey, because we deserve to know exactly why bankers weren t prosecuted.Featured image by Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Harry Reid UNLEASHES Anti-Trump Rant On Senate Floor, Calls Him A ‘Human Leech’ (VIDEO)","Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has it out for Republican nominee Donald Trump.On Thursday on the Senate floor, Senator Reid (D-Nev.) unleashed a rant against the business mogul with a bitterness that makes you wonder just how long he had been holding it in. Reid is approaching retirement as January draws near, and it s clear that the Democratic leader wants America to understand just how important it is to make sure that the country isn t left in Trump s little, orange, greedy hands.Making reference to a Newsweek article that questions the Trump Organization s international business ties and suggests that a President Trump could be disastrous for national security, Reid called Trump  a spoiled brat  and  a notorious con artist  whose questionable, scammy business practices would only spill over into his administration if he becomes President. Reid said: Let s be clear about Donald Trump. He s a spoiled brat, raised in plenty, who inherited a fortune, used his money to make more money, and he did a lot of it by swindling working men and women. Why would he change as president? The answer is simple. Trump won t change. He is asking us to let him get rich scamming America. Donald Trump is only trying to help one person   Donald Trump.   If given the opportunity, Donald Trump will turn America into a big scam, just like Trump University. Reid also raised some eyebrows by calling Trump a  human leech. Trump is a human leech, who will bleed the country and sit at his golf resort laughing at the money he has made. You can watch Reid s amazing anti-Trump rant below: Reid s rant is pretty epic and judging from his other statements about Trump, there s probably many more Trump disses on the way before his retirement. Just earlier this week, Reid attacked Trump for insulting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton s health by calling Trump fat and drawing attention to his own unhealthy lifestyle. Reid said: Take a look at this character that s running for president. He complains about her health? What does he do? He s 70 years old, he s not slim and trim, he brags about eating fast food every day. Look at his health a little bit. Let s just say we hope Harry Reid keeps this up!Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Respected Forensic Pathologist Suggests Trump And Putin Might Actually Be POISONING Hillary (TWEETS),"Hillary Clinton shocked America a few days ago when she was forced to leave the 9/11 memorial in New York City early, only to have her campaign announce that the former Secretary of State had been diagnosed with pneumonia shortly after.While Dr. Bennet Omalu isn t a household name for many of us, Omalu is the well-respected forensic pathologist and neuropathologist that was responsible for discovering chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in dead NFL players. This discovery made Omalu an inspiration for the NFL film Concussion where Omalu s character was played by actor Will Smith.With that being said, when a famous doctor gives his medical opinion, people are going to pay attention   and when Omalu weighed in on Clinton s illness last Sunday, it definitely raised some eyebrows. Omalu tweeted that he sensed there was a possibility that Clinton was being poisoned  by none other than her political rival, Donald Trump, and his best friend Russian President Vladimir Putin. He tweeted: I must advice the Clinton campaign to perform toxicologic analysis of Ms. Clinton s blood. It is possible she is being poisoned. TwitterA little less than an hour later, Omalu followed his statement up with a second tweet announcing just who he thought might be behind Clinton s illness. He said: I do not trust Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. With those two all things are possible. TwitterWhile it s been a common thought that Putin and Trump might be working together, the suggestion that they might be poisoning Clinton has certainly never been publicly stated before. Twitter reacted to Omalu s thoughts with some skepticism, however Omalu s credentials and tenacity are well-known and people are interested in what he has to say.Interestingly enough, the man who has something to say about anything and everything has yet to respond to this accusation. Trump has been oddly silent about Omalu s tweets.What do you think of Omalu s suggestion?Featured image via Pete Marovich / Getty Images",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Heckler Screams ‘F*ck Hillary’ At Clinton Rally – And She Just Laughs At Him (VIDEO),"Sometimes you ve got to laugh   especially if you re the Democratic nominee, who is currently facing down a level of unbridled hatred that rivals all previous presidential candidates with the exception of Barack Obama. Recently, Hillary contracted pneumonia   or, if you listen to our friends on the Right, she s on her deathbed and completely unfit to serve as President because reasons. The downright comical reaction to this, coupled with the numerous right-wing anti-Hillary witch hunts like Benghazi and the manufactured controversy over her emails, is enough to give one a chuckle   but it s even more fun when one of the ignoramuses who subscribe to such ridiculous notions stops by one of her rallies to tell the Democratic nominee how he really feels about her.As Hillary spoke to a crowd in Greensboro, North Carolina, a heckler screamed: F*ck Hillary. Hillary s reaction was priceless. As the crowd cheered for her and  Hillary  chants broke out, a grin formed on the face of the former Secretary of State, quickly turning into a chuckle then a full-blown laugh. Now, I just want to have a conversation and other people can wave their arms and their signs,  she said after the moment passed, going back into her speech like nothing happened as the heckler was escorted out.Interestingly, she didn t order her supporters to attack the man. She didn t lash out, she didn t insult him. She respected his right to display a dissenting opinion. This is something you would never see at a Trump rally, where the 2016 nominee s  basket of deplorables  regularly beat protesters   especially the elderly and minorities   senseless for expressing themselves.Vote for the candidate who can keep her cool in November   the future of our nation depends on it.Watch the incident below: Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Flint Pastor Who Shut Trump Down Hits Back With Grace And Class After He Insults Her,"If Donald Trump thought he was going to get away with calling the pastor of the black church he visited in Flint, Michigan a  nervous mess,  he was dead wrong. Pastor Faith Green-Timmons is a strong woman and rock in her community. She didn t let Trump get away with trying to use her church as a platform to attack Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and, as he always done when he feels embarrassed or attacked, Trump went on Fox News and trashed Pastor Green-Timmons. That isn t all, either   Trump flat-out lied about what happened while he was at the church and how his visit was received.Well, this pastor was the wrong one for Trump to decide to start another one of his personal feuds with. Refusing to sink to Trump s pattern of low-road insults when there is any sort of conflict whatsoever, Pastor Green-Timmons had this to say regarding Trump s remarks and her interruption of his statements in her church: They had plans to make it a little more than they originally said, and I said,  No, you re going to stick to the original plan. And so when he asked to come in to make a statement and the statement began to go beyond what he originally said, I asked him to stick to what he said. You came here to welcome our workers and thank them for what they have done and that s what he stuck to. So, in other words, Trump wanted to do things his way, and he got shut down by a strong black lady pastor and he can t stand it. Pastor Green-Timmons continued: When I heard from the Trump camp that they wanted to come by and see that we give out water, we give out foods that help mitigate lead and asked if he could come   all are welcome. It s a public event. Then, Pastor Green-Timmons turned her attentions to some of Trump s more bigoted and insulting statements regarding African-Americans and others. Still, despite the horrible things Trump has said, this lady continued to show class: I wanted him to see the best of Flint in the sense that we re an educated congregation. Some of the statements that I ve heard him make about African-Americans, Mexicans and others were degrading. I wanted him to see intelligent people, loving people, caring people, who have done well with the resources that they had. Exactly. Trump speaks about minority communities in some of the most bigoted, ignorant, and insulting language imaginable, and this pastor just wanted to give him a chance to see some educated, thriving black people who are not out joining gangs and getting shot on every street corner. The thing is, though, Trump will continue to hold on to his racist opinions, for he is incapable of changing them. It s too bad this pastor wasted her wisdom, time, and space on such a disgraceful person.Watch Pastor Green-Timmons speak below:Flint Pastor Rev.

" GOP Rep. Makes IMPOSSIBLY Asinine Demand Of FBI, Proving How Desperate GOP Is To Nab Hillary","After eleventy billion investigations into Hillary Clinton, her handling of Benghazi, and the whole brouhaha over her emails, the GOP is getting desperate. The FBI has been giving emails to the House Oversight Committee, and one Republican congressman is very unhappy about the way they re doing it.He wants to know just one simple thing   why do the FBI s document releases coincide with federal holidays?Yes, that s an actual, official question that Rep. Michael Turner (R-OH) asked FBI director James Comey about how they re releasing information: Please explain how the FBI s procedures for processing documents and information to the public coincide with these Federal holidays, and how those procedures could be improved to ensure greater public awareness, and reduce the appearance of political motivations. The FBI told the House that it would release information and documents as they became available, no matter the day of the week. They had to know that could include weekends and holidays. Some information was released over the Independence Day weekend (but not Independence Day itself), and more was released over the Labor Day weekend (but not Labor Day itself). Coincidence, yes, but intentional? Turner needs a lot more than that to accuse the FBI of playing politics.There are no words for how laughably nonsensical this is.Really, Turner s attempt to make this look like a political ploy on the part of the FBI is, in fact, a political ploy on his part, carried out on behalf of the Republicans who are terrified of Hillary.When the FBI decided not to press charges against Hillary for mishandling classified info, the House decided to open a new investigation into whether she lied under oath. Anything to prove that she s a criminal in presidential clothing. They also pushed to re-open the investigation into her private server recently, and there s a huge push to investigate whether there were improper dealings between the Clinton Foundation and the Department of State.If they have a legitimate case, they should pursue it in a legitimate manner. Posing this kind of a question to the FBI just shows that they re more scared of Hillary than they re trying to let on.Featured image by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Told An Incest Joke About Ivanka So Creepy Dr. Oz Was Forced To Edit It Out (VIDEO),"To most people watching Trump s disastrous appearance on quack pseudo-doctor, Dr. Oz s show, the appearance was simply an attempt by Trump to prove he s healthy by releasing no information whatsoever. But did you know he also   again   joked about having relations with his daughter?The remarks were edited out of the final copy, but journalists who were there for the taping certainly noticed it was missing.So, uh, looks like the producers of ""The Dr. Oz Show"" cut out the awkward comments from Oz and Trump about fathers kissing daughters  Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) September 15, 2016The Dr. Oz show edited out #Trump's comments on kissing daughter Ivanka as often as possible. #TrumponOz  Michelle Fay Cortez (@FayCortez) September 15, 2016So what, exactly, did Trump say? Dr. Oz said when Ivanka Trump came on stage,  It s nice to see a dad kiss his daughter,  reported NBC s Peter Alexander.  Trump responded that he kisses her every chance he gets. Combined with Trump s numerous other sexual remarks about his daughter, this was just too much for Dr. Oz, who edited the statement out of the show entirely in an apparent effort to save Trump the embarrassment of once again proving himself to be the  incest candidate. I ve said if Ivanka weren t my daughter, perhaps I d be dating her,  Trump once said of Ivanka on  The View.  Prior to that, he bragged to Howard Stern about Ivanka s body. More recently, he told GQ: She s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren t happily married and, ya know, her father And, of course, he once said on a talk show that what he and Ivanka have most in common is  sex. Add that to creepy photos of the two like you see below and it s very clear that the Trump family is a mess.A picture of Donald Trump, with his daughter Ivanka, perched atop two concrete parrots having sex. pic.twitter.com/TFse8gM1An  Tim Ireland (@bloggerheads) January 31, 2016Creepy Trump family is creepy. pic.twitter.com/I1SL6gnnsi  Kyle Foley (@KFoleyFL) September 15, 2016Excellent @HuffingtonPost Ivanka Trump feature.

 Campaign In Damage Control Mode After Trump Jr. BUSTED Joking About Holocaust (AUDIO),"If there s one rule in politics, it s that you never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER joke about the Holocaust   but Donald Trump Jr. apparently didn t get that memo from his white supremacist friends.Sure, Trump Jr. follows numeroous prominent white supremacists on Twitter, gives interviews to Nazi talk shows, and (like his father) retweets the meth-fueled  white power  crowd like it s going out of style (without realizing that that sort of thing went out of style before Twitter was a thing), but no one really expected him to just joke about the Holocaust   after all, even most Nazis display more tact. The media has been her number one surrogate in this. Without the media, this wouldn t even be a contest, but the media has built her up,  Trump Jr said in an interview with Chris Stigall on Talk Radio 1210 WPHT in which he explained that if Republicans lied like Hillary Clinton   whose fact-checked statements reveal she actually tells the truth most of the time, unlike Donald Trump   there would be hell to pay:They ve let her slide on every indiscrepancy (sic), on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing. If Republicans were doing that, they d be warming up the gas chamber right now. After the interview, Trump told NBC News that he was referencing corporal punishment, not the Holocaust, though he did not state what form of  corporal punishment  involves  gas chambers  aside from, you know, gas chambers. Like all those times Trump Jr. and his father have retweeted white supremacist imagery and propaganda, he says that this was not the least bit anti-Semitic.Hear it for yourself below: Featured image via Getty Images/Jeff Swensen",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Paul Ryan Has A Request For Donald Trump, And Trump’s Campaign Won’t Like It AT ALL","House Speaker Paul Ryan sold his soul the day he endorsed Donald Trump to be president of the United States. It was clear that he was just being a spineless, cowardly weasel when he did so, as he did it under cover of a big policy speech by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Ever since then, Ryan s relationship with Trump has been frosty at best, and they have never appeared on stage together.During a weekly press briefing, Ryan got the one question everyone has been asking: Why hasn t Donald Trump released his tax returns? This is especially pressing right now, as Newsweek just printed a damning story that shows that should Donald Trump become president, the Trump Organization s rather dubious web of international ties would endanger the national security of the United States of America. With that revelation, it is even more imperative than ever that the American electorate sees Trump s tax returns. Hell, even George W. Bush s ethics lawyer said that these ties are a, quote,  serious problem. Therefore, Ryan finally caved and said Trump s returns need to be made public. First, he referenced his own releasing of his taxes when he ran for Vice President: I did release my returns. I ll defer to Donald Trump as to when he thinks the appropriate time to release his returns. I know he is under audit, and he has an opinion on when to release those and I ll defer to him on that. He then hedged, though, because he is a coward who is afraid of upsetting Trump s supporters, and said: I released mine. I think he should release his. I ll leave it to him when to do it. No, Speaker Ryan, you need to get forceful with this. We need the returns NOW. With all of the shadiness surrounding Trump s business dealings and ties to nefarious characters around the world, this is vital information for the nation and world to know. Trump is trying to run the clock out on this one, to keep the voting public from knowing just what he gets up to. Do your job, and DEMAND Trump s tax returns.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Christian’ Pastor Gets BUSTED In Arizona For Molesting Children For Decades,"An Arizona pastor used his position to get close to children for decades so he could rape them   and now he has finally been arrested by law enforcement.Jose Vicente Morales of the Iglesia Impacto De Fe church in Phoenix was arrested at his home on September 9th and charged with sexual abuse, child molestation and sexual conduct with a minor, one of whom he  married  when the girl was 10 years old and impregnated when she was 13 years old.According to ABC 15:Court records show that 49-year-old Jose Vicente Morales had been molesting children for years; he impregnated one of the victims when she was 13 years of age.In the ongoing investigation, police report Morales may have molested or sexually assaulted at least five victims who were either church members or known to Morales outside of the church setting.Multiple victims have come forward, including a teen who says the pastor lured her into a home and and sexually assaulted her and another who says he molested her from the time she was seven until she turned 12.Thus far, Morales  church has not responded to the arrest and charges.But when they finally get around to doing so, hopefully they will not blame the victims like the Columbia Road Baptist Church in North Olmsted, Ohio did earlier this month when they demanded that a teenage girl apologize to the wife of the youth pastor who raped her repeatedly.Churches are an easy target for rapists and pedophiles because working in that setting, especially as a pastor, provides them instant access to potential victims who are more likely to trust them.That s why it is so important for churches to perform background checks and for parishioners to be cautious. Not all pastors are predators, but these incidents have happened far too often to trust someone entirely.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ivanka Trump Whines After Interviewer Points Out That Her Dad Thinks Pregnancy Is Bad For Business,"Ivanka Trump s maternity leave plan hit a wall during an interview with Cosmopolitan when she was asked about her father s belief that pregnant women are an inconvenience.Republican nominee Donald Trump is clearly pandering to women by suddenly coming out in support of paid maternity leave in a desperate ploy to get women to vote for him.As it stands, over 70 percent of women view Trump unfavorably and Hillary Clinton would win the women s vote by an even wider margin than President Obama did in 2012.So, Trump is hoping that women will automatically switch their allegiance to him if he offers maternity leave to the country, something he hasn t even offered to his own female employees unless their name is Ivanka Trump.According to the Huffington Post:Employees at the Trump SoHo, New York and Miami hotels, as well as the Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, all said that they do not offer workers paid maternity leave. Instead, they said that the company complied with the Family and Medical Leave Act, a federal law that requires companies to give employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off for the adoption or birth of a child.That little hypocrisy combined with The Donald s past comments about women and pregnancy is exactly why Ivanka s interview with Cosmopolitan was so disastrous.Prachi Gupta asked Trump s daughter about a remark he made back in 2004 when he called pregnancy an inconvenience to business. It s certainly an inconvenience for a business,  he said.  And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business. Donald Trump said that pregnancy is an inconvenient thing for a business,  Gupta informed Ivanka.  It s surprising to see this policy from him today. Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed? Ivanka responded by accusing Gupta of being negative and then bragged about how her dad is a champion for women in the workplace. So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and I think my father has put forth a very comprehensive and really revolutionary plan to deal with a lot of issues. So I don t know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you re going to make a comment like that. My father obviously has a track record of decades of employing women at every level of his company, and supporting women, and supporting them in their professional capacity, and enabling them to thrive outside of the office and within. To imply otherwise is an unfair characterization of his track record and his support of professional women. So the policies at our company reflect that, and the diversity of our workforce, from a gender perspective, and in all perspectives, reflects that. So my father has been a great advocate for the women in the workforce, and that s part of why he recognized that reform is so necessary. Except that Trump doesn t even offer women paid maternity leave at his own hotels and resorts. Instead they have to take unpaid leave and even to get that they have to use vacation and sick days. In other words, in order for a new mother to get unpaid leave, she would have to sacrifice her paid vacation and sick days to get it.When pressed, Ivanka claimed ignorance of the comments. Well, here s the video of Trump saying it via NBC.Ivanka then cut the interview short rather than stick around any longer to answer hard questions.Donald Trump does not care about women. He is only pretending to because he wants their votes. If he gets elected there is no way he would fight for paid maternity leave. It would require him to give it to all of his female employees and he won t do that because it would mean having to give up money that could go towards buying himself a gold-plated toilet or another luxury jet.If he really cared about women he wouldn t have been treating them like shit over all these years and he wouldn t be treating them like shit now. But Trump thinks women are stupid and that they ll support him just because he suddenly supports a policy that he has always opposed.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Gets His Deplorable A** Handed To Him By Keith Olbermann,"Hillary Clinton was wrong to say that half of Donald Trump s supporters are deplorable. Because it s more like 100 percent, says Keith Olbermann.As you may already know, the former MSNBC host is back with a brand new gig just in time for the election and he is not holding back.On Thursday, GQ s special political correspondent laid on the smack down on the Republican nominee for whining about Hillary s remark while simultaneously wearing it like a badge of honor.Beginning by noting how Mike Pence refuses to even call racist Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke a deplorable person, Olbermann soon mocked Trump for deciding that he should release his medical records to Dr. Oz  because Doctor Who is not filming locally. Of course, Trump chickened out at the last minute and decided not to release his records.Getting back to Trump s deplorables, Olbermann mentioned the pair of violent episodes seen at Trump rallies recently, one in which a Trump supporter grabbed a man by his neck and punched him and another in which a Trump supporter decked a 69-year-old woman and sent her crashing into her oxygen tank.Olbermann pointed out that it s still a kinder and gentler crowd because Trump s supporters  aren t all wearing the same colored shirts yet. Olbermann then went through Hillary s list of Trump s deplorable supporters, which includes racists, sexists, homophobes, Islamophobes, and xenophobes. He named names like Carl Paladino and Robert Jeffress and aired what they have said about black people, gays, and Muslims. These are campaign leaders, surrogates, friends of Mr. Trump,  Olbermann said.  If they re not talking to a basket full of deplorables, who are they talking to? Why would you have them there? You say stuff like that at work, you get fired. But Trump welcomes those who hate and is just fine with them spewing their hate out loud.In the end, Olbermann slammed every Trump supporter, including those who are not racist, sexist, etc If you support Trump. If you think he should be president regardless of how much he and his advocates hate and mock and punch old women with portable oxygen canisters. If you re not condemning this madness and repudiating these deplorable people and you are not racist, not sexist, not homophobic, not xenophobic, or not Islamophobic. If you re supporting him not for those things but in spite of them, you are even more deplorable. The correct number, Secretary Clinton, is not 50 percent, it s 100. Here s the video via YouTube.It s so good to have Keith Olbermann back.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Surprise, Surprise: Trump Lied About What Happened When He Visited A Black Church In Flint","Donald Trump visited Flint, Michigan on Wednesday. Of course, that city is the place where is a crisis regarding having unusable water due to dangerously high lead levels and pipes that need to be replaced. While there, Trump toured a water plant and visited a Black church, where he pretended to care about the community, which is mostly poor and black, and suffering badly due to the water crisis.This was a bad idea in the first place, as the Mayor of Flint, Michigan, Democrat Karen Weaver, had already told Trump and his campaign that her city s very real issues were not to be used as some kind showboating photo-op. However, as per usual, Trump did what he wanted anyway, and when it didn t go well, he did what he usually does in such instances: LIED.Thursday morning, Trump went on Fox and Friends and criticized the pastor of Bethel United Methodist Church, Faith Green-Timmons. We ve all seen the viral video in which Pastor Green-Timmons shut Trump down when he attempted to use her church as a platform to attack Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and in response, Trump lashed out at her on Fox News, calling her, quote, a  nervous mess.  Trump them went on say that the audience wanted him to keep speaking, but luckily there was an NPR reporter in the audience at the time, so those of us who weren t there can get the real story about what went down. From NPR: The audience was saying let him speak, let him speak,  Trump told Fox and Friends.That isn t true. In fact, several audience members began to heckle Trump, asking pointed questions about whether he racially discriminated against black tenants as a landlord.And that s when Green-Timmons   who Trump said Thursday had planned to ambush him   stepped in to defend Trump, saying the Republican nominee was  a guest of my church, and you will respect him. Thank you. Thank you, pastor,  Trump responded.The pointed questions for Trump continued as Trump wrapped up his remarks, though   and that s the moment when the press traveling with Trump was hastily escorted out of the room.Well, there you have it, folks. The people in the traditionally Black church saw right through Trump s attempt to pander and pretend that he actually cares about their well being, when, in fact we all have witnessed Trump s racism on full display throughout this travesty of a campaign. These people weren t having it, though, and they let Trump know exactly what they think of him.If it weren t for this reporting, we d have a very different account of what went down in that church on Wednesday, which is just one more reason not to trust a word that comes out of Donald Trump s mouth.Featured image via video screen capture from Twitter",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Whiny Trump Lashes Out Like A Toddler At Pastor Who Shut Him Down (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is likely pleasing the GOP establishment lately because he hasn t been totally crazy. However, the embarrassing video of a Black female pastor, Faith Green-Timmons, shutting him down when he tried to use her church podium like a campaign rally went viral, and of course Trump couldn t resist attacking the pastor like the toddler that he is at heart.Trump phoned in to his buddies over at Fox and Friends Thursday morning, and said that the audience was great but the pastor was, quote, a  nervous mess.  Trump told the Fox hosts: Something was up, because I noticed she was so nervous when she introduced me. She called NBC, ABC   when she got up to introduce me, she was so nervous, she was shaking. And I said,  Wow, this is sort of strange.  And then, she came up. So she had that in mind, there s no question about it. Now, of course this is likely untrue. The pastor of Flint, Michigan s Bethel United Methodist Church did not look at all nervous when she shut Trump down, but of course facts don t matter to The Donald. All that matters is that he was embarrassed in public and video of it went viral, so the person who caused him said embarrassment must pay. Here is video of that Fox and Friends exchange: This is not a person who has the character or temperament to be president, and of course that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to all the things about Donald Trump that utterly disqualify him from being President of the United States. Part of being in public life   especially political public life   is the ability to take criticism. That is simply an ability that Trump does not possess. His ego and narcissism will not allow him to let any slight   perceived or real   go without launching some kind of attack, usually full of childish, untrue, low-road insults.Remember, America   this man could be your next president, and he reacts like a 2-year-old anytime anyone disagrees with him for any reason whatsoever.Featured image via Wonkette",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 These Words From Trump’s Own Mouth OBLITERATE His ‘Outreach’ To Women (VIDEO),"Donald Trump must think women are stupid. Recently, the billionaire s campaign revealed what they pretend is a comprehensive plan to help struggling families after the birth of a child.Sure, Trump has a long and storied history of making sexist remarks about women and generally treating them like trash, but now that he wants to be President, he s going to provide maternity leave. Of course, his plan is not quite all he and his cohorts pretend it to be.First off, men are left out entirely. Sure, it s 2016 when sometimes women work and men take care of the children, or there might be a couple of guys bringing a child into the world through one method or another. Trump s plan, which proposes six weeks of maternity leave and tax credits for stay-at-home mothers, serves only to reinforce the stereotype that a woman s place is in the home cooking dinner and raising the kids and the man s place is to go out and serve as breadwinner. Stay-at-home fathers, in Trump s world, do not exist and should not even be considered for any tax credits and benefits.Part of the problem is that Trump was famously uninvolved in raising his own children. I won t do anything to take care of them,  he told Howard Stern in 2005.  I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. It s not like I m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park. Men simply do not raise children, or so Trump thinks. And, of course, it s probably best to let him think that in case he spawns more. Can you imagine how much more f*cked up his kids would be if he took a direct role in raising them?Of course, his thoughts on pregnant women in the workplace aren t very nice, either. In a 2004 interview with Dateline NBC,  the billionaire explained that while pregnancy is  a wonderful thing for the woman  and her  husband  (the idea of male same-sex couples does not enter into his mind, of course) it s  an inconvenience for the business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business,  he concluded, adding that women  should  feel like they will be replaced if they do not return to work quickly even if they will not necessarily be replaced.Watch Trump trash female employees who have the audacity to get pregnant below: Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rape Apparently Doesn’t Earn Jail Time Anymore – Even If The Victim Is Only Two Years Old,"If you are a young white male in America, apparently you are free to stick your genitalia into whomever you please without having to fear that you will end up in prison. Consent be damned. Proof of this is the disgusting case of an Iowa teen who raped a toddler   on camera   and was given a free pass when he was finally hauled in front of a judge for his repulsive crimes.Kraigen Grooms has admitted to raping the 2-year-old in April of 2013 when he was 16 years old. Not only did he rape the small child, but he did it on camera so he could livestream the sexual assault for another pervert to watch online. Investigators believe that the attack was premeditated, and also that he had plans to rape a 3-year-old boy in the same manner.Grooms was arrested in March 2014, when he was 17. Initially, he was charged with second-degree sexual abuse, a felony that could have put him in prison for 25 years. However, after spending two years in a juvenile detention center and county jail, he cut a deal and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of engaging in a lascivious act with a child in July. This week, Judge Randy Degeest handed Groom, who also goes by the alias Kraigen Simmers, a 10-year suspended sentence and sent him home.This means that he will see absolutely no prison time for raping a 2-year-old. Let that sink in for a minute.This is just the most recent in a string of high-profile sexual assault cases that have ended with the rapist getting a slap on the wrist and being sent on his way. The most well-known of these cases being that of Brock Turner, who raped an unconscious woman behind a dumpster and was given just six months in jail, but ended up only serving three before being released.Is there any question that anyone who rapes a toddler   a f*cking toddler   should be behind bars until hell freezes over? Is there any question that America s rape culture has spiraled completely out of control when you can rape a 2-year-old, on camera, livestream it on the internet, and not end up in prison?Featured image via KTVO screen capture",News,"September 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Black Pastor Totally SHUTS Down Trump, And He Backs Away Like A Wimp","An African-American pastor in Flint, Michigan was able to get Donald Trump to do what nobody else has for the last year: shut up.It happened when Trump, after touring a water treatment facility in the lead-afflicted city, spoke at a church. As part of his speech, instead of addressing the water crisis that has many in the area worried about their children s health, the Republican nominee started in on a political attack against Hillary Clinton.Pastor Faith Green Timmons then stepped in, and stopped the Republican in his tracks.Timmons told Trump,  I invited you here to thank us   not to give a political speech.  Apparently completely chastened, Trump stopped and instead of his usual braggadocio he reverted to an almost childlike tone.He told Timmons,  No, I never. Never would. Never would. Never would.  He then quickly ended his speech, saying a few more words and promising to bring jobs back to the city.The incident reflects the latest gaffe for Trump with black voters. For a few weeks his campaign has claimed that he is conducting  outreach  but in reality, Trump has instead repeatedly told blacks that they live in poverty, stuck in inner city hellholes filled with gun violence. He has also described the living situations of blacks in America as so horrible; they can t do  any worse. This has prompted considerable backlash among minority voters and others, leading to extremely negative polling for Trump with that voting bloc, even as he has improved among some white voters.Trump has said that this supposed  reaching out  to black voters will result in gains for his campaign, but the evidence instead shows that his ham-handed activities are more likely to continue the Republican trend of poor performance in this demographic. This incident in Flint is unlikely to help that trajectory.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jay Leno Wants Someone To Beat ‘The Crap’ Out Of Trump So He Learns This Valuable Lesson,"This presidential election has been bringing everyone out of the woodwork to reveal their opinions on who is running. Especially in regards to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.One person who seems to be abundantly clear about his opinion on Trump is former Tonight Show host Jay Leno. Sitting down with The Hollywood Reporter, Leno revealed, in so many words, that Trump needs to have some sense knocked into him, and maybe, just maybe, he d be a better person for it.Leno told The Hollywood Reporter: I think this is the problem with Donald Trump. I don t think anybody has just ever beaten the crap out of him, so he has this attitude of  whatever.  When you have the crap beat out of you, you learn how to negotiate, you learn how to deal with people. You learn that kindness is the greatest virtue you can have.I know people that say  Shut the f ing door  and I know people who say  Is it cold in here?  If you say  Is it cold in here?  someone will shut the door for you, and you haven t annoyed anybody or pissed anybody off. And that s my attitude about life, just trying to be kind.When you are poor it s easy to be kind. When you are rich and famous, it s not that it s hard to be kind, but it s harder because people suddenly start catering to your eccentricities or whatever it might be. And that s just the thing, Trump seems to have never been in a situation in his life where he s been forced to be kind. He s so used to everyone bending over backwards to please him, that he doesn t seem to think that he actually should be kind to others in return. This would definitely explain his bully behavior, and how he feels so entitled to pretty much everything, including the White House.Note: This article in no way is suggesting that Trump should be harmed. It is just revealing what Jay Leno said in an interview.Featured image via Kevin Winter/Getty Images",News,"September 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Leaked Emails Show Colin Powell Has STRONG Opinions On Donald Trump,"Colin Powell is NOT voting for Donald Trump, at least according to emails disclosed by a hacker group to BuzzFeed and on DCLeaks.com, who reported that the leaks came from Russia.The emails reveal that Powell thinks Trump is a  national disgrace,  and that his campaign is built on racism. He also has strong opinions on the birther movement, which Trump thoroughly embraced.In an Aug. 21 email from Powell to Miller, he blasted Trump for embarking on a  racist  movement that believes President Obama was not born in the US. Yup, the whole birther movement was racist,  Powell wrote.  That s what the 99% believe. When Trump couldn t keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim. Powell says that Trump has no chance at the African-American vote:The leak shows that Powell criticized Trump s lack of outreach to black voters, saying  there is nothing he can say  to convince black Americans to give him their votes, and criticizing the birther movement. He takes us for idiots,  Powell wrote, according to CBS.  He can never overcome what he tried to do to Obama with his search for the birth certificate   the whole birther movement was racist. Source: Huffington PostPowell doesn t think Trump has a much better chance with women, at least not after he aligned himself with disgraced former Fox News head, Roger Ailes, who left after numerous allegations of sexual harassment. And Ailes as an advisor wont heal women, don t you think?  Powell wrote.The Republican former Secretary of State isn t a Hillary Clinton fan either.The latest email leak reveals Powell also criticized Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for her handling of her email scandal, saying she  could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me to it,  according to The Intercept.Documents released this month as part of the FBI s investigation into Clinton s emails showed Powell had told Clinton to  be very careful  if she used a Blackberry for email, warning that if her use of a BlackBerry became public knowledge, those emails could become  official record[s] and subject to the law. Powell s only advice seemed to be for the media, which he accused of giving him too much attention.  You guys are playing this game, you are his oxygen. A spokesman for Powell admits that the emails are legitimate and that Powell was hacked, although, if Powell s people know who did the hack, they aren t admitting it. As for Powell s advice to Clinton, well, perhaps he should have followed it as well.Featured image via Kris Connor/Getty Images.",News,"September 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NYPD So Delighted With Cop Who Killed Eric Garner They Now Pay Him $120K,"Daniel Pantaleo was caught on video using an illegal chokehold on Eric Garner, killing him in front of the entire world for the crime of selling loose cigarettes. There was a lengthy investigation, but ultimately no indictment, despite public outrage and widespread protests. Now, a new report of payroll records shows just how delighted the NYPD was with Pantaleo and his deadly actions.Ever since Pantaleo killed Garner on that New York City street, he has consistently gotten raise after raise, even while being actively investigated for Garner s death, and is now making upwards of $120,000 a year.A report from Politico reads: Pantaleo earned $119,996 in fiscal year 2016, which includes earnings between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016. His base pay was $78,026 and he earned $23,220 in overtime, according to a review of payroll records. He received an additional $12,853 in unspecified pay, which could include retroactive pay or bonuses.Pantaleo s earnings in 2016 represent a 35 percent increase in overtime pay, and a 14 percent overall increase from the previous fiscal year, which began shortly before Garner s death on July 17, 2014.In that 12-month period, ending June 30, 2015, Pantaleo earned $105,061, with $76,488 base pay, $17,109 in overtime and $11,673 in additional earnings, records show.In fiscal year 2014, which was completed before Garner s death and Pantaleo s subsequent reassignment, he made $99,915, which included $17,189 in overtime. An investigation into Garner s killing by the Department of Justice is ongoing and the NYPD has still not released the results of their investigation. Mayor Bill DeBlasio insists that state law prevents Pantaleo s full disciplinary file from being released. This claim prompted Governor Andrew Cuomo to call bullshit and he told DeBlasio not to blame  the state law when a judge interpreted the law otherwise and your office is now contradicting the judge. So far, this is what we do know about Pantaleo s record as one of New York s finest, according to Latest.com:  Pantaleo was involved in at least three lawsuits in which he allegedly violated a (black) citizen s civil rights. He was disciplined for a bogus  stop and frisk  incident before the NYPD banned the practice. In April he was named as a defendant with the NYPD for allegedly crashing his cruiser into another man s car and injuring the driver. So in America, when a cop kills an unarmed black man with an illegal chokehold and there is video proof, not only does he get a paid vacation, he also gets one hell of a pay raise. Something is very wrong with this picture.Featured image via Latest.com",News,"September 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cowardly Trump Decides Not To Reveal Medical Records To Dr. Oz At The Last Minute,"The Republican nominee s campaign has bragged about how he will appear on Dr. Oz and allow the television physician to read the results of his latest physical. I know this   that Donald Trump will turn over those records right to Dr. Oz and he will analyze it and it will be a surprise to Donald Trump what Dr. Oz is going to say,  Fox News host Brian Kilmeade said on Tuesday.According to The Hill, Trump bragged about undergoing the physical and made predictions. I did pretty much the whole deal, because I think we should, I think we should do that,  Trump added on CNBC s  Squawk Box. Trump predicted his physical would show  large numbers  and  hopefully very good statistics. I feel very confident, otherwise I probably wouldn t be telling you I did this, right?  Trump asked. Large numbers  are not necessarily a good thing, especially if we are talking about blood pressure.But despite his bragging, Trump has still not released any medical information and he won t be releasing any during his interview with Dr. Oz either.CNN host Brian Stelter reported on Wednesday that just hours before the show taped Trump cowardly backed out of releasing his medical records and letting Dr. Oz read them on the air. Trump will be talking with Oz about his physical activity, dietary habits, and broader health-related issues. The plan also calls for Trump to discuss political topics that are of interest to the  Dr. Oz Show  audience, like efforts to fight the Zika virus and Trump s new child care policies. So the only thing we know about Donald Trump s health is that all of his lab results are  positive  according to the ridiculous note written by his alleged physician Dr. Harold Bornstein, which Dr. Jennifer Gunter hilariously shredded on CNN last month. Lab results aren t reported as being  astonishingly excellent  or not   we give lab values of positive or negative,  she explained.  Then there s the fact that he says all of Mr. Trump s results are positive   which, of course, would be a bad thing. When I tell someone they have gonorrhea, when they have a positive test for gonorrhea, they re not happy about that. That s not  astonishingly excellent.

 Republican Candidate Gets Caught Calling For Lynching President Obama,"A Minnesota Republican is desperately trying to convince voters that his years worth of racist, sexist, and anti-gay Facebook posts no longer reflect who he is.Nolan West is a former GOP aide who is now running for a seat in the Minnesota statehouse.But he apparently didn t think that his social media posts were fair game, so when the Minneapolis Star Tribune started writing a story about all of his offensive and hateful statements he rushed to scrub his account of everything going all the way back to 2008 when he called for lynching President Obama soon after he was first elected in 2008. IT S LYNCHING TIME,  West wrote.And it s not hard to see where West gets his hatred of the first African-American president from. West also posted praise of the Confederacy and expressed his utter disdain for Abraham Lincoln. As we all know, the Confederacy started a Civil War to keep slavery legal while Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and kept the Union together.According to the Star Tribune:On the day South Carolina removed the Confederate battle flag from its statehouse grounds in 2015, West reposted an advertisement for the flags on his Facebook page, continuing his history of publicly expressing admiration for the Confederacy and disdain for Lincoln.West is currently on House GOP staff while running for the north Metro suburban seat vacated by retiring Rep. Tim Sanders, R-Blaine.In 2011 West marked the day Confederate President Jefferson Davis resigned from the U.S. Senate, 150 years earlier. West also called Lincoln, a fellow Republican,  the single worst president this country has ever seen. In addition, the Star Tribune reports that West also posted offensive remarks about women and gay people.West, of course, offered what should be considered a fake apology and claimed he is not the same person that he has been for the last 8 years. I apologize for posting insensitive material,  West wrote in an email.  I ve taken those posts down because they do not reflect who I am or what I believe. And rather than drop out of the race in disgrace like he should, West is staying in the race, which, if Minnesota voters would like to know, is against his DFL opponent Susan Witt, who by all rights should win in a landslide so that District 37B is not represented by a racist Confederate sympathizer who clearly believes black people should still be enslaved and hanged at the end of a rope.Featured image via Twitter",News,"September 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Small Business Owners Trump Stiffed Issue Blistering Revelations (VIDEO),"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump touts his business prowess as his number one reason he will be great for working people should he be elected President of the United States. However, thanks to a group of creditors that Trump stiffed while he was busy destroying Atlantic City s economy, we are now privy to a very different story than the one Trump s been peddling on the campaign trail.We all know that Trump built extravagant and ridiculously gaudy and expensive casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey. This meant hiring many contractors to put the places together. One such contractor was Forest Jenkins, father of Beth Rosser, who was interviewed with others in similar positions on Anderson Cooper 360.Rosser says, It was like we won the lottery,  when her father landed a $200,000 contract to help install toilet partitions in the Taj Mahal casino. Forest s son, Steven Jenkins, echo s Rosser s claims, saying, It was a big job. It was great. We were all excited. I had the fuzz from those carpets on the wheels of my dolly for months after that job. However, things quickly went downhill for the small business when Trump didn t pay them. Steven says of the devastating loss: We weren t this big company. We didn t have tons of money in an account somewhere to cover things. The company was Forest Jenkins  life s work, and he made it grow from the ground up. Trump s stiffing them almost cost them all that work though. Luckily, they somehow survived, and Beth and Steven now operate the company since their father s passing. Trump stiffed the Jenkins family in 1988, and then he filed bankruptcy on the Taj Mahal three years later and ran off with millions.Trump owed the Jenkins family $231,000, and they only got $70,000   and that was only after a years long court battle trying to force Trump to pay up. Beth Rosser says of her feelings regarding Trump today: It s 27 years later. I grit my teeth every time I see him on television blustering about what a wonderful businessman he is. He stepped on a lot of people. Of course, the Jenkins  story is only the beginning. Nat Hyman is also a victim of Donald Trump. In 1996, Hyman went into the snake s den when he managed to land a plum of a spot to begin selling jewelry from his fledgling company   a kiosk in a great spot right in Trump Tower. After having success with his new company, Landau Jewelry, in Trump Tower, Hymen was able to expand into Trump s casinos. That s when the trouble started.Trump began making baseless claims that Hyman was selling shoddy products, and to that end tried to force him to leave Trump Tower and go other places where he would never be able to make a living. When Hyman refused to give up the spot in the Trump Tower lobby, Trump lashed out by pulling the plug on Hyman s ability to set up shop in the casinos. He also wound up having Trump s lawyers sicced on him. Hyman says  of his ordeal: I think I spent over a million dollars in litigation with him. I tried to stand up to him everywhere I could but it s exhausting, and it s silly. To him, it s a sport. To him, it s fun. After Hyman was finally done with his spot in Trump Tower, of course, he was replaced with Trump s own merchandise.Paul Friel s family business is another that fell into the black hole that is working with Donald Trump. His family was hired to install structures for slot machines, desks, and the like in one of Trump s casinos. However   surprise, surprise   Trump bought the contract out from under the general contractor he had hired and refused to pay. Paul Friel is the company s founder s grandson, and says his father lost his business over what Donald Trump did. He says of the experience: We had already worked for three (general contractors), and every single one of them lived up to their word until Donald Trump came to Atlantic City. That s not all, either   Trump used his pull in Atlantic City to blackball the company, and it worked, despite their stellar reputation. After attempting to deal with being taken for a ride by Trump, the elder Friel s company went bankrupt. Paul Friel says: I think it surprised him the most that Donald Trump had blackballed him   even though we had an excellent name in Atlantic City.He was devastated. The fact that we had seen such a huge future in Atlantic City for his business that all of a sudden because of one deal   his business in Atlantic City was done. Edward Friel died in 2006, but Paul Friel is determined to be his voice. He says of his late father: He would say,  Paul, do this for us let the country know what kind of man this is. Here is video of the segment:Donald Trump often brags about his business record, but some small business owners say his tactics cost them. https://t.co/tZMS6nRFwI  Anderson Cooper 360  (@AC360) September 14, 2016Also, I guarantee you that these are not the only ones Trump stiffed. They are just the only ones brave enough to speak out. After all, speaking out against Donald Trump has had disastrous consequences for many people. They have a right to be afraid. However, if these stories are any indication, I think we can all pretty much figure that the only person Donald Trump cares about is Donald Trump, and it would an absolute national emergency to put the future of our nation and the free world in his hands.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Raging Trump Supporter PUNCHES A 69-Year Old Woman In Her Face (VIDEO),"As is normal these days for Trump rallies, protesters and Trump supporters clashed outside just such a rally in Asheville, NC. Police arrested five people and are looking for one more   a man who punched a 69-year old woman in the face.Shirley Teter has been protesting all her life, and Trump gave her another reason to protest. At 69, she s not in the best of health, and is actually on oxygen. Nevertheless, she heckled the deplorable Trumpkins outside the rally: Why did I get involved yesterday, at my age? Because I ran into another situation that was sickening my heart. She admits to telling one Trumpkin he d better learn to speak Russian, at which point he socked her. She fell on her oxygen tank and has sore ribs and a sore jaw, but nothing s broken. She does, however, have a question for all the Trump supporters whose sugar-glass fragile egos were bruised by Hillary s  basket of deplorables  comment.She wants to know whether people find a Trump supporter punching her in the face deplorable.Because really, who hits a 69-year old woman on oxygen in the face for heckling? And these people are upset that they re getting called  deplorable?  That is some damned deplorable behavior right there. There s no reason to hit someone over something they say, no matter how badly it makes your blood boil.Trump himself actually incites violence, and it seems these people think anything less than hitting people who don t bow and scrape before their king is being too politically correct. At another rally recently, a deplorable Trump supporter hit a protesting woman in the face and she is the person who was escorted out. That s not deplorable to these people? Or are they proud to be the scum of the Earth like this?Watch a report below: Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 UNC Campus Police LAUGH In Rape Victim’s Face . . . Because Football,"A woman was raped by a football player at the University of North Carolina and she says that when she reported the attack to campus police, they laughed in her face.Delaney Robinson decided to go public with her horrific ordeal because she felt it would be the only way to get justice since the school would obviously rather protect a sports star than prosecute a sexual assault. Speaking at a press conference, Robinson said that on the night of Feb. 14, Tar Heels junior linebacker Allen Artis brutally raped her in a dorm room while she was  incapacitated. Denise Branch, Robinson s attorney, said that her client went to the hospital following the assault, where they examined her and collected evidence with a rape kit. According to hospital records, Robinson suffered  vaginal injuries consistent with blunt-force trauma and bruising consistent with a physical assault. But when she reported the sexual assault to campus police, they simply laughed in her face and asked her a litany of offensive, victim-blaming questions. I was treated like a suspect,  she said.  What was I wearing? What was I drinking? How much did I drink? How much did I eat that day? Did I lead him on? Have I hooked up with him before? Do I often have one-night stands? Did I even say no? What is my sexual history? How many men have I slept with? Robinson added that she was allowed to listen to an audio recording her attacker s interrogation, and it was much different than what she had been forced to endure. Rather than accusing him of anything, the investigators spoke to him with a tone of camaraderie,  Robinson said.  They provided reassurances to him when he became upset. They even laughed with him when he told them how many girls  phone numbers he had managed to get on the same night he raped me. Robinson freely admits that she had been drinking on the night in question, but according to the  assistant district attorney for Orange County  unconsciousness is rape, blackout drunk is not rape. After police and prosecutors convinced Robinson that there was no way she had enough evidence to pursue felony charges, she filed two misdemeanor charges. Artis was arrested for the assault on Tuesday and according to District Attorney Jim Woodall, the case is still pending.This case is just the latest incident of rape that has been brushed off thanks to America s rape culture. Brock Turner was released after serving only three months in jail for raping an unconscious woman behind a dumpster. But hey, he had a promising swimming career and athletes get a free pass when it comes to rape.Robinson said her  life has changed forever while the person who assaulted me continues as a student and a football player on this campus. As of Tuesday evening, UNC had not yet released a statement regarding the allegations.Featured image via  Streeter Lecka/Getty Images",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ann Coulter Reveals The DISGUSTING Thing That Made Her Love Trump (AUDIO),"It might be hard to believe from the amount of praise she shells out for Republican nominee Donald Trump, but believe it or not, conservative pundit Ann Coulter wasn t always a fan of the business mogul   until he showed America just how racist he truly was.In a recent appearance on the Off Message podcast, Coulter told Politico s Glenn Thrush that she was upset The Donald has softened (and repeatedly flip-flipped) his position on immigration   a sign that he was giving into the pressure of the  amnesty  crowd that was taking control over his campaign.During the podcast, Coulter expressed great resentment toward Trump s new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who she is blaming for the GOP nominee s recent shifts on some of his most offensive and controversial policies. Just to show you just how much Coulter loves Trump for his racist, xenophobic policies, she once said that Trump s proposal to ban all Muslims from coming into the United States was the best birthday gift ever. In fact, Coulter admitted that she hadn t even liked Trump   she originally thought he was a  boorish vulgarian    until he came forward with his disgusting plans for immigration. Coulter reminisced about the correspondence she used to have with Trump s then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski: I was worried, the first few weeks after he announced, and   I haven t told the other people this   I would email in a point or two now and then, and whatever. Whenever I would email Corey, whatever,  Stop re-tweeting ugly photos of opponents  wives,  or whatever it was, what the final point was [was] always,  Don t let him back down on immigration. And Corey was getting a little exasperated with me and kept saying,  He s not backing down.  Then he came out for the Muslim ban on my birthday, Dec. 8, my best birthday gift ever. I finally emailed Corey and said,  OK, I think he s not backing down. But now that Trump has been going soft on his plan to deport 11 million people, Coulter is upset and being rather vocal that she thinks it s a  mistake.  Coulter must be devastated that her political soulmate is backing down on her, because at one point of the podcast, she said this: I worship him like the North Koreans worship the  Dear Leader    yes, I would die for him. Which totally makes sense, because Coulter soon revealed that she and Trump actually have a lot in common   they both lack empathy and will just say whatever the f*ck they want: I didn t get the gene that makes me care about what other people think. I m much like Trump that way. I don t really care. They re just words.

 Former KKK Leader Thanks Trump’s VP For Being So Nice (AUDIO),"The most infamous leader of the Ku Klux Klan has just proven that the biggest bullies have the thinnest skins. Former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, a Trump-loving white supremacist who spent a good chunk of his life leading a hate group, apparently doesn t like to be called bad names because it hurts his feelings.Duke let Americans in on his sensitive side when the ex-KKK leader spoke about the fact that Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence had held off on calling Duke names like  deplorable  (even though Pence has disavowed Duke s support, unlike his boss). In return for his kindness and compassion, Duke praised Pence extensively on his radio show for refusing the call Duke exactly what he is. Duke said: The whole idea that they were trying to make Pence call me names basically, and he didn t bite on that, was a real positive thing for all of us. The secret alliance between Duke and the Trump campaign is disgusting, and it has had disastrous effects. Because he was so inspired by Trump s racist and hateful presidential campaign, Duke is now running for the Senate   and why wouldn t he, when several Americans have been so accepting of the racist and anti-Semitic views that Trump holds as well? The Trump campaign has basically paved the way for people like Duke!You can listen to Duke rave about Pence below:The terrifying thing about Trump s campaign is that the GOP nominee has literally made it ok for hate speech and bigotry to be expressed publicly. He has, in many ways, normalized it in his campaign speeches, his violence-provoking rallies, and by sharing white supremacist and anti-minority messages on social media on a regular basis. Trump has made room for the most awful, divisive views to be expressed and given people like Duke the guts to have platforms they never would dared to pursue before. This is the America that Trump is creating   and it s not great. It s terrifying.Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Anchor Accidentally Announces Hillary Clinton’s Death On Air – Conspiracy Nuts Go WILD,"Sunday night, an ABC News affiliate in New York began their show with a startling breaking news announcement from weekend anchor Joe Torres: Hillary Clinton was dead. We begin with the breaking news about Hillary Clinton s death They were talking about her health, and dove right on into her leaving a 9/11 memorial on Sunday after feeling light-headed. Then her campaign released the news that she was battling pneumonia, and then this happened. That has since been edited out, but remains up on YouTube for now. Watch the original report below:WABC 7 clarified the mistake later on. They told TVSpy that Torres had misspoken and meant to say  health,  which anyone with more than two brain cells, who watched the whole report, would have figured out: During a live introduction to a story about the health of Hillary Clinton, Joe Torres inadvertently said  death  when he meant to say  health.'  a station spokesperson said.  It was clear from the context of the story, the reporters  information and graphics on the screen that Secretary Clinton was alive and recovering.' Both the original story and the edit have tripped the conspiracy loons  sensors anyway, though, because why let reason get in the way of a good Hillary conspiracy? So now they re going nuts. Some are convinced that ABC edited that out to cover up the fact that she did actually die, and that the campaign is using a body double to cover it up: A video clip of WABC-TV Channel 7  Eyewitness News  in New York City opened last night with Anchorman Joe Torre saying  more on Hillary Clinton s Death.  The opening line, however, seems edited-OUT of the video archive!Did Hillary die after leaving the 9-11 Ceremony in New York . . . and the information is being concealed? A whole slew of irregularities have cropped-up indicating that may actually be the case!BODY DOUBLE?A short time later, a person ALLEGED to be Hillary, is seen leaving the East 26th Street home of Chelsea Clinton, but there are problems with this person.  The conspiracy baloney never ends with this crowd, does it? Here s another that s just certain she really died: Now it looks like the story has gotten even worse. Based on rogue reports, it is now our understanding that Hillary Rodham Clinton may in fact be dead.Yes, you read that correct. After airing on ABC news in New York for merely seconds, it was pulled from the air.This isn t a random report. Don t believe it? We didn t believe it at first either, until we saw an additional report of the same exact occurrence: At this point, we don t have all the news.All we know for sure is that Hillary Clinton may have actually died at a local hospital in New York City. It doesn t help that David Shuster tweeted that DNC operatives were informing him that the committee would hold an emergency meeting to discuss Hillary s replacement. That tweet was later deleted and replaced with one saying that they were considering a meeting to discuss replacing her.Furthermore, all the heretofore-unknown doctors across the Internet who are coming out of the woodwork to loudly proclaim that her pneumonia means she s at death s door don t seem to know some basic facts: 1) Pneumonia is fluid in the lungs, and 2), there are eleventy billion things that can cause it. Some are serious, some are very serious, some are not-so serious.Donna Brazile, the interim DNC chair, said that they re looking forward to Hillary s speedy recovery and return to the campaign trail, essentially destroying Shuster s tweets and the stories of those who piled on to that. It also destroys the absurd notion that she actually died, but hey, conspiracy nuts will think what they want. Despite what the Hillary-haters are hoping, she is alive and well and recovering. She s not at death s door, and she s certainly not dead.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Rep. Elijah Cummings Rips Republicans A New One For Witch Hunt Against Hillary,"House Republicans are spending much of their time and the taxpayers  money persecuting Hillary Clinton in order to sabotage her presidential campaign, and Rep. Elijah Cummings is sick of it.Over the last four days, Republicans have called three  emergency  hearings of the House Oversight Committee to investigate Hillary Clinton s emails despite the fact that FBI Director James Comey has already completely debunked GOP claims that she intentionally destroyed emails to hide something.During the third hearing on Tuesday, ranking committee member Rep. Elijah Cummings took Republicans and committee chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz to the woodshed  or engaging in these political witch hunts. Today is the third  emergency  hearing in four business days, third emergency hearing about Secretary Clinton s e-mails in four business days,  Cummings began.  Third in four days, emergency. I believe this committee is abusing taxpayer dollars and authority of Congress in an astonishing onslaught of political attacks to damage Secretary Clinton s campaign for president of the United States of America.  Cummings continued: This is the first time in my 30 years in Congress that I have personally witnessed the Oversight power of this committee abused in such a transparently political manner to directly influence a presidential campaign.The point of today s hearing is to investigate baseless Republican accusations that Secretary Clinton, or her aides, ordered destruction of emails to conceal them from investigators. The most important fact for the day s hearing is that the FBI already investigated these accusations and thoroughly debunked them. They interviewed witnesses, examined forensic evidence and concluded that these accusations have no merit. FBI Director (James) Comey stated, and I quote,  We found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them,  end of quote. He went on to say, and I quote,  We did not find any evidence of evil intent, intent to obstruct justice. Cummings then described the strategy Republicans are using in order to continue to attack Hillary even though their charges have been proved to be untrue. Of course, Republicans did not like the answers that the FBI director gave, so they simply manufactured today s hearing out of thin air. This entire hearing is a contrived campaign photo-op.Step one: Publicly accuse the witnesses of criminal activity, no matter how ludicrous, then refer them to attorney s office for investigation.Step two: The next day invite the same witnesses to an emergency hearing on those criminal accusations and rush to issue a flurry of unilateral subpoenas demanding they testify. No debate, no vote.Step three: Express false outrage when these witnesses   this is a playbook   express false outrage when these witnesses, who you just accused of criminal activity take advice from their counsel to assert their Fifth Amendment right to not testify. There you have it   presto, instant photo op. Here s the video via YouTube.Republicans should pay a heavy price for relentlessly attacking Hillary Clinton in Congress like they have been doing over the years with their never-ending investigations into Benghazi and her emails. It s a total waste of money and time. But they would rather spend it on political persecution and character assassination instead of on dealing with real problems facing our nation.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Cher Reacts To Dr. Oz Reading Trump’s Health Report, And It’s The Best Thing Ever (TWEET)","This year s election is really shaping up to be one of the most ridiculous ever in the history of the republic. And adding to this bizarre circus is the fact that Dr. Mehmet Oz, noted TV host and alleged scam artist, will be the one reading Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s health report. However, not the whole thing.Oz told Fox News  Brian Kilmeade about how Trump has instructed the release, and when Kilmeade asked,  Oh, it s still going to be his decision?  Oz replied: It s his decision. You know, I  the metaphor for me is it s the doctor s office, the studio. So I m not going to ask him questions he doesn t want to have answered. So basically, we re only going to hear what Trump wants us to hear like a scripted reality show (which, btw, all  reality  shows are).Upon hearing the news of Dr. Oz releasing Trump s medical report, legendary entertainer extraordinaire Cher took to Twitter to let us all know how she feels about it.And because Cher tweets in fluent emoji, her tweet is translated here: Why is Dr. Oz letting Trump pimp him out!? Oz is bound by ethics!! Is he so hungry for ratings he ll let Trump use him like guys at a frat party. WHY IS DR OZ LETTING TRUMP PIMP HIM OUT OZ IS BOUND BY ETHICS?

 Christiane Amanpour Rips The Media A New One Over Coverage Of Hillary Clinton’s Pneumonia (VIDEO),"If you ve subjected yourself to cable news over the last few days, you ve probably noticed a non-stop barrage of coverage of the most  pressing issue  of the week. Hillary Clinton is *gasp* human, and she sometimes succumbs to germs.If anything, the fact that Hillary made an appearance at New York s 9/11 Memorial Service, despite the fact that she had pneumonia, is a testament to her stamina, not a sign of weakness, but the media has turned it into just another way Hillary is deceiving the public.This tactic might backfire on the media. Nearly every woman can relate to the idea of trying to forget they are sick, so they can get s**t done, whether that s**t includes taking care of a household or taking care of a country (or anything in between).CNN reporter Christiane Amanpour is pretty angry. Her network has been among the worst in the non-stop bullying of a woman recovering from a common illness. So, Amanpour took to the air to beg the media,  Can t a girl have a sick day or two? Finally tonight, imagine a world where you can t slow down, you absolutely cannot, can t get sick. This weekend after attending a 9/11 memorial in New York after more than a year of relentless campaigning, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, fell ill and these pictures have boomeranged across the world. Several hours later the campaign revealed the former secretary of state had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. But surely this can t be a case of a human being having an off day. Nope. Like so many things Hillary, the media are having a field day, off to the races with another debilitating case of indignant outrage. This must be another typical Clinton conspiracy to fool them with total transparency breakdown. Talk about a transparency breakdown what about Donald Trump s tax returns? Where are they? Can t a girl have a sick day or two? Don t get me started because when it comes to overqualified women having to try 100 times harder than underqualified men to get a break or even a level playing field, well we know that story. And then, to hammer home the double standard, Amanpour talked about the male presidents who have suffered from their various forms of frailty. And seriously now, the 14th president of the United States, Franklin Pierce rose to that role after earning the nickname Fainting Frank for twice collapsing in two battles in 1847,  she continued.  Who could ever forget George Bush senior throwing up all over the Japanese prime minister and then fainting at a state dinner? And he oversaw the fall of the Soviet Union and won the first Gulf War. Considering the media outrage over Hillary failing to tell them she had pneumonia on Friday, consider the media activity shielding some great American presidents, agreeing for instance, not to show these photographs of Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose Polio kept him confined to a wheelchair, but did that stop his New Deal for America or winning World War II? And then there is everyone s favorite president, John F Kennedy. Now he saved the world from possible nuclear Armageddon during the Cuban missile crisis, called for a new frontier in space and generally inspired whole generations around the globe while the press kept secret his painful struggle with Addison s disease. Leading the world in sickness and in health if the boys can do it, why not the women? Here s the video courtesy of Media Matters:The bottom line is, human bodies are flawed, and even the most healthy of us occasionally gets sick. Treating that as a moral failing is insulting to all women, not just to Hillary Clinton.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Leave It To Obama To ROAST Trump For Saying He’s Best For This Specific Voting Bloc (VIDEO),"If you haven t noticed, Donald Trump isn t quite the epitome of the average working American. He s a guy who was born into wealth, got his start through his father, and claims he s a terrific businessman. As the old saying goes, he was born on third base but thinks he hit a triple.Out on the campaign trail pointing out this utter disconnect between Trump and working America is none other than President Obama. The president can t seem to quite wrap his head around the fact that people would choose a man who can t relate whatsoever to the plight of working America to represent them.While speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Obama said: Really, this is the guy you want to be championing working people? This guy who spent 70 years on this earth showing no concern for working people. This guy s suddenly going to be your champion? He spent most of his life trying to stay as far away from working people as he could. And now this guy is gonna be  the champion of working people.  Huh? I mean, he wasn t gonna let you on his golf course. He wasn t gonna let you buy in his condo. And now suddenly, this guy s gonna be your champion? And the answer to that would be, no, he s not. Trump is only in this race for Trump and no one else. That s been made clear from the start.Watch the president go after Trump and his bold claims to be best for American workers here:Obama says Trump has never been a champion for working people:  He wasn t going to let you on his golf course.  https://t.co/kouzvjrEwD  NBC News (@NBCNews) September 13, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 ‘Christian’ Ex-Mayor Raped 4-Year-Old Girl For Three Years And Blames Her For It,"Another hypocritical  Christian  politician gets caught sexually abusing a child and has the gall to blame the victim instead of taking personal responsibility.Former Hubbard, Ohio mayor Richard Keenan faces a lengthy prison sentence after being indicted on eight counts of rape and 12 counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition last month.In 2010, Keenan bragged about his so-called  Christian  values upon becoming the new mayor.  I m a Christian,  Keenan told the Youngstown Vindicator at the time.  Dedicating my life to Jesus has changed my life. Don t preach it, but live it. Over the course of three years, Keenan repeatedly sexually abused a little girl from when she was 4-years-old until she turned 7.Keenan admitted to the crimes after the girl told his wife, who is a pastor, about the abuse.The 65-year-old Keenan also admitted to what he had done to other relatives in a group session at a hospital.He also told a social worker at a psychiatric facility about raping the girl, saying that the abuse began in 2013 but then blamed the little girl for his actions, calling her a  willing participant  who somehow consented to being raped by him.For some reason, Keenan was allowed to go free on $75,000 bond and won t stand trial until April of next year.If convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison.This is yet another example of a supposed  Christian  committing a heinous crime and being a complete hypocrite.At least in this case the pastor did the right thing by reporting her rapist husband to authorities instead of trying to cover it up like a church in Ohio did earlier this year when a youth pastor raped a teen girl repeatedly. Columbia Road Baptist Church could have prevented the sexual abuse had they fired and reported the pastor for obsessively sending text messages to the girl. But they basically looked the other way and gave the pastor the opening to take his obsession with the teen girl to a sick new level and then disgustingly blamed the victim and demanded that the girl apologize to the pastor s wife.And conservative  Christians  wonder why people are abandoning religion. THIS is why.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Deplorable: That Time Trump Accused Half The Country of Being Lazy Moochers,"After Hillary Clinton did the unthinkable   told the truth about the Trump base of support   the Republicans were quick to call it her  47 percent moment.  The politically incorrect group of right-wingers were furious that Clinton wasn t being P.C., so they decided to engage in a faux outrage campaign, complete with an already made ad from the Trump campaign.Donald Trump was particularly offended by Clinton s comments, saying: The disdain Hillary Clinton expressed towards millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service. Is that so? Well, then I guess Trump should disqualify himself from being President of the United States, considering he accused 50 percent of the country of being lazy moochers just last year.In a June 2015 interview on Fox News with Sean Hannity, Trump told viewers: The problem we have right now we have a society that sits back and says we don t have to do anything. Eventually, the 50 percent cannot carry and it s unfair to them but cannot carry the other 50 percent. Certainly not as hyperbolic as  basket of deplorables,  but still reminiscent of a legitimate  47 percent  moment   only this time Trump bumped the number up. Just six months earlier, in January 2015 (before he announced his candidacy) Trump told MSNBC s Kasie Hunt that,  We have a tremendous amount of people in this country that don t want to work. They have no inclination to work.  Trump also told Romney he shouldn t apologize for making the infamous comment, saying that it was correct.So Trump has gone on the record saying he thinks 50 percent of this country is comprised of lazy moochers who take from the other 50 percent (where in actuality it s the top 1 percent that take from the next 95 percent).So, insulting a faction of a right-wing extremist political electorate based on the reprehensible things they have said and believe in is wrong, but calling 50 percent of the entire country lazy and moochers isn t? Conservatives really know who to get offended easily.What Clinton said wasn t insulting, it was the truth. What Romney, and now Trump said, was insulting. Spare me the outrage, Republicans.Featured image via Brian Blanco/Getty images",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Bill O’Reilly Just Got Caught Lying About Defending Roger Ailes From Sexual Harassment Lawsuit,"Has Bill O Reilly really not learned what he says on video stays on video?Because he clearly thought he could blatantly lie during an appearance on the Today Show on Tuesday morning and get away with it.After being asked by Savannah Guthrie if he regretted defending Roger Ailes when Gretchen Carlson accused the Fox boss of sexually harassing her, O Reilly claimed that he never did such a thing, and that he only commented about Ailes as a boss. My comments were made to Seth Meyers about what kind of a boss Roger Ailes was, not about the case. I don t know anything about the case, OK? Nothing. So he was a good boss, best boss I ve ever had, and that s what I said to Seth Meyers. That s all I ve said. And I m not going to say anything else because I work for this company and I don t really have any insight into anything, so for once in my life I m going to keep my big mouth shut. Here s the video via Media Matters.But as Raw Story points out, Bill O Reilly blatantly lied to Guthrie s face, because footage of O Reilly s appearance with Seth Meyers exists and clearly shows that the fibbing Fox host defended Ailes by calling Carlson s lawsuit  frivolous  and that he stands by Ailes  100 percent. In this country, every famous, powerful, or wealthy person is a target. You re a target, I m a target. Anytime, somebody could come out and sue us, attack us, go to the press, or anything like that. Until Amer   and that s a deplorable situation  Until the United States adopts the British system of civil law, whereby if you file a frivolous lawsuit and you lose, the judge has a right to make you pay all court costs. Until we adopt that very fair proposition, we re going to have this out of control tabloid society that is tremendously destructive.

 Trump’s ‘Taco Truck’ Guy Spoke Again – Guarantees No Latino Will Ever Vote For Trump (VIDEO),"Republicans love minorities. Let me rephrase that. Republicans love minorities who regularly squat down and take a big dookie on their own people.Donald Trump s Latino for Trump founder is the perfect Republican Latino, in that he is self-hating. On  Full Frontal  with Samantha Bee, Marco Gutierrez (the guy who threatened taco trucks on every corner if Hillary wins) went even further and insulted literally every Hispanic on the planet by calling them  primitive and underdeveloped. Appearing on Samantha Bee s late-night show Monday night, Gutierrez warned,  As Hispanics, we are a primitive and underdeveloped culture. We ll take whatever we can take if you let us.  Asked if that means people should be scared of Mexicans, Gutierrez replied,  Yes, you should be very frightened. Here s the crazy video:Well, Hispanics are frightened   of a Trump presidency. And they could very well be the determining factor into who does win the election. Trump s own words against immigration turned most Hispanics against him (72 percent). His anti-Hispanic rhetoric could turn even traditionally red, but heavily Hispanic states, like Texas, blue.While Gutierrez is a relatively tiny player in Trump s well of surrogates, he s become a national joke, so what he says gets a lot of play   something the Trump campaign is probably cringing over, but not enough to actually disavow themselves.Gutierrez s foot in mouth style is the best news possible for Hillary Clinton. If anything, Gutierrez will help get out the vote, for the other side.All of these (swing) states are crucial to Trump s ability to win the presidency, and if he can t reverse this trend, beating Clinton could be near impossible   unless there is a drop off in Hispanic turnout compared to four years ago.That doesn t appear likely at this point, said a senior analyst for Latino Decisions, the firm that conducted the poll on behalf of America s Voice, a liberal group that supports comprehensive immigration reform and the legalization of illegal immigrants. The question is: Is Trump going to motivate higher turnout?  David Damore said Friday in an interview with the Washington Examiner.  I think there s a potential for that to occur.

 Pat McCrory’s Bigoted Bathroom Law Costs NC Millions In Lost Events,"North Carolina Republican Governor Pat McCrory s bigotry is costing his state millions of dollars. Since he signed into law a bill that effectively blocks any and all discrimination protections for LGBTQ people,  musicians have cancelled concerts in the state, businesses like PayPal have pulled the plug on plans to settle there, and the NBA has moved its All-Star game away from the state for 2017 as well. Now, the NCAA has delivered another blow, by relocating seven post-season games as well, which will cost the state millions.The NCAA released comments regarding the decision, saying that it is because of the cumulative actions taken by the state concerning civil rights protections.  G.P.  Bud  Peterson, who chair s the NCAA s board of governors went on to say: This decision is consistent with the NCAA s long-standing core values of inclusion, student-athlete well-being and creating a culture of fairness. Here are details regarding the cancellations, courtesy of Boston.com:  the Division I women s soccer championship scheduled for Dec. 2 and 4 in Cary, just outside the capital city of Raleigh;  the Division III men s and women s soccer championships set for Dec. 2 and 3 in Greensboro;  the Division I women s golf regional championships set for May 8-10 in Greenville;  the Division III men s and women s tennis championships set for May 22-27 in Cary;  the Division I women s lacrosse championship set for May 26 and 28 in Cary;  and the Division II baseball championship from May 27 to June 3 in Cary.In addition, two March men s basketball games set for Greensboro will be relocated as well. Of course, the spokesperson for the North Carolina GOP had to weigh in with her ignorance. Kami Mueller said: I wish the NCAA was this concerned about the women who were raped at Baylor. This is unsurprising, considering that bigoted Republicans simply cannot understand that letting transgender people use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender presentation and identity has nothing to do with rape; in fact, it is trans people who are in the most danger regarding this law.McCrory s Democratic challenger, Roy Cooper, had more of the right idea here. His spokesman, Ford Porter, said: It seems that almost every day, we learn of a new consequence of HB2.  We need to repeal this law and get our state back on track. With the NCAA pulling out of North Carolina due to what they describe as a new policy that makes sure that the places they allow to host their events  demonstrate how they will provide an environment that is safe, healthy and free of discrimination,   that leaves that Atlantic Coast Conference. However, HB2 might cost North Carolina that event as well. The ACC says that there has been worry over the consequences of such a law within their ranks as well.Pat McCrory and North Carolina s bigoted Republican Party is literally killing their state s economy, all in the name of hate. None of these people have any business holding public office, because they clearly do not care about the impact of their legislated hate. Make no mistake, the NCAA is not the first, and nor will it be the last, organization that decides that they will not hold events or do business in a state whose hallmark is discrimination.Hopefully, North Carolina voters get rid of these idiots come November.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bill Maher Has A Message For Trumpkins Regarding Hillary’s Health, And They Won’t Like It At All (TWEET)","Comedian Bill Maher is no fan of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. While, during the Democratic primary, Maher was a supporter of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, he has urged everyone to get in line behind Hillary Clinton, and has been singing her praises   and slamming Trump   ever since.We are all aware by now that Hillary, like any human being does at times, has gotten sick. Her campaign announced that she has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and she left a 9/11 memorial service in New York City abruptly because she was dehydrated and overheated. This stirred up the feverish hopes on the Right that she is somehow unfit to be president due to health concerns. Of course, this is ridiculous; she ll be fine. Her doctor has examined her and she is recovering nicely.That is where comedian Bill Maher comes in. He tweeted that he would vote for  Dead Hillary  over Trump.Pneumonia? I'd vote for Dead Hillary in this race. She could be Patient Zero for Bubonic Plague, still better than #TangerineNightmare  Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 13, 2016This will be seen as inappropriate by some, as joking about death isn t necessarily the best thing to do, but Maher s message is clear: Hillary in any condition is a much better choice than Trump on his best day, with his best behavior. In short, sane people know that Donald Trump is in no way fit for the presidency, and he is, in fact, nothing more than a dangerous demagogue who should have never gotten this close to the White House.Do as Maher says, for the sake of the nation   VOTE BLUE in November.Featured image via David Becker/WireImage",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sam Bee DISMANTLES The Media For Letting Trump Be The Raging Liar He Absolutely Is (VIDEO),"If you haven t noticed, but you probably have, the news media never calls Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump out on his constant lying.The most recent example of this was during the NBC Commander-in-Chief Forum when Matt Lauer went really hard on Hillary Clinton when it came to demanding answers, and then was ridiculously soft on Trump, even though Trump believes Lauer was too hard on him.Well, one person in particular is absolutely fed up with these media shenanigans and that person is Samantha Bee of TBS s  Full Frontal. Bee said: There s no time to report the facts and what people feel are the facts. You ve got to choose one. Guys, we are swimming in bad information. Our dads are on Facebook. Chemtrails are not real, dad. Adding: Why can t the media just tell us what s true and what s bullsh*t? Bee also points out that many in the media are refusing to call Trump out for lying because then it could appear that they are biased with their own opinion. However, she lays to rest that common misconception when she says: Calling a liar a liar isn t an opinion if you can prove it. That s what we call a fact. The idea that news network executives traded their balls for ratings, that s just my opinion. And as many in the media are trying to make Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton somehow equal when it comes to being qualified, or equally as bad, they are clearly mistaken. Bee lets them have it and does NOT hold back, saying: Maintaining the image of fairness requires them to portray Hillary and Trump as equally flawed candidates, even though they know that s incorrect. On the one hand you have the most breathtakingly, unqualified, ignoramus to of heave his balls within striking distance of office. A race-baiting bully who, according to two meticulously researched biographies, is a tax cheating, investor swindling, worker- shafting, dictator-loving, pathologically lying, attorneys general bribing, philandering, mobbed up, narcissistic serial con artist who hasn t got the attention span to read a fortune cookie much less a f*cking intelligence briefing. Adding: But on the other hand, Hillary used a private email server. See? Perfectly even. BOOM!Yeah, not exactly even. Trump is the LAST thing we need for this nation in general, let alone as Commander-in-Chief.Well f*cking done, Sam.Watch Same Bee tear the media a new one here:Featured image via video screen capture, HT C&L",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Deplorable Trump Supporter Punches Protester And Slaps Woman At Rally,"Trump supporters have proven Hillary Clinton right once again.During a rally in Ashville, North Carolina on Monday, a Trump fan was filmed physically assaulting some protesters with the Republican nominee s full support as he gave the thumbs up.At the top of some bleachers, a middle-aged white guy can be seen grabbing and punching a male protester. Security intervened, but rather than remove the Trump supporter for committing an actual crime, they kicked out the protesters instead.The man verbally harasses the group as they file out down the steps all while acting like he is some kind of tough guy and then goes as far as slapping a female protester on her way out.Here s the video via Twitter:WATCH: Man slaps several protesters as they are being escorted out of @realDonaldTrump rally in Asheville, NC. pic.twitter.com/KMKCDvIar4  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 12, 2016Again, this asshole did not get removed from the rally, and nor was he arrested. Like the other bullies who have assaulted people during Trump rallies, he was left alone while the protesters were dealt with even though he was clearly the aggressor.At another rally earlier this year in North Carolina, a Trump supporter named John McGraw sucker-punched a black protester and then triumphantly declared to the media that he and his white buddies might have to kill the man next time. At least McGraw was arrested, but only after the rally.And Donald Trump does nothing to stop this kind of behavior from his hooligan supporters. He cheers them on and congratulates them. It seems like he is proud of his supporters for beating up people who don t agree with him.This is how violence finds its way into politics, and Trump has done nothing but allow it to escalate. Not too long ago, Trump suggested that gun owners do something to stop Hillary Clinton from selecting Supreme Court nominees. And on Saturday, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin called for a bloody rebellion if Hillary wins in November.Clearly, Hillary Clinton was right to call Trump s supporters deplorable.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SCARY: Trump Just Declared War On Multiple Religions,"As part of his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has made a frightening new attack on multiple religions within the United States and many in the media haven t even noticed it yet.Trump referenced the new, frightening vision he has for religion in the country in a speech he gave in Baltimore on Monday. We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag,  he said Monday at a speech to the National Guard Association in Baltimore. Moments before, he claimed he d be a  president for all Americans  in an effort to portray himself as more of a uniter than his rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton.Trump s  under one God  line may sound like boilerplate presidential campaign rhetoric, even if it is a bit, um, Hitlerian. (The Nazi Party slogan was  Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer!    or,  One people, one empire, one leader! ) But the inclusion of the word  one  is new. A review of transcripts suggests he debuted it last Tuesday during a speech in Greenville, North Carolina, and has since used it in campaign speeches in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Pensacola, Florida; and Washington, D.C.Based on Trump s claims that he is a Christian and the history of the Republican Party, it would probably be safe to say that Trump s  one God  is the Christian God. But in America, based on the First Amendment to the Constitution, the free exercise of religion is enshrined in our customs. Among those non-Christian religions practiced in America are Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, Hindu, and many others. There is also agnosticism and atheism, both also protected under the Constitution.Trump has also demonstrated hostility towards one faith in particular   Islam. He has promised to ban Muslim migration to the United States and has expressed openness to using tracking devices on Muslims.Connected to this new attack, Trump recently spoke at an event designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group conference. Among the headliners at the Values Voter Summit was the Family Research Council, who has compared being gay to drug use, and adultery and has compared gay rights activists to terrorists.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hateful Klansman Praises GOP Ticket For What They Just Did,"Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke is over the moon with happiness after Republican vice-presidential candidate Mike Pence refused to call him  deplorable. In a CNN interview on Monday afternoon, Pence told CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer that he doesn t  name call,  and would not call avowed racist and anti-Semite David Duke  deplorable,  as Hillary Clinton has repeatedly done during the campaign. Later asked to do so in a Fox News interview, Pence again refused.This has made Duke, currently running as a Republican for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana, very happy. It s good to see an individual like Pence and others start to reject this absolute controlled media,  Duke told BuzzFeed News.  The truth is that the Republican Party in Louisiana   I received the vast majority of Republican votes for United States senator before and for governor before that in my state. The truth is the Republican Party is big tent. I served in the Republican caucus. I was in the Republican caucus in the legislature. I had a perfect Republican voting record. It s ridiculous that they attack me because of my involvement in that nonviolent Klan four decades ago. Duke is a former Grand Wizard, part of the leadership of the Ku Klux Klan, a hate group with a very long history of terrorizing black families all across the country. The Klan was very involved in the lynching deaths of blacks, other killings, and initiated the practice of burning crosses on the property of blacks in order to frighten them.In addition, Duke is also an anti-Semite who has promoted the concept of Holocaust denial and the conspiracy theorists who promote the fake history surrounding that idea.Duke has endorsed the Trump/Pence presidential ticket, and while Trump now says he rejects the move, Trump also refused on three occasions in one CNN interview to condemn Duke and his support.Featured image via YouTube",News,"September 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 North Carolina Just Came Up With The Most Ludicrous Reason Yet To Stop Early Voting,"North Carolina, which is still butthurt over the Supreme Court s decision not to allow their voter suppression law to go into effect before the election, is getting a touch creative with their reasons not to allow early voting. What if a person votes, and then dies?We wish we were making this up.Alas, though, we aren t. Dallas Woodhouse, North Carolina s GOP executive director, tried his best to sound extremely worried about this non-existent crisis when he spoke to Fox 8 about it: We have a situation here where you have to be alive on Election Day. If you vote early, you still have to be alive in a very close race you could literally have dead people voting. We have a situation here.  Har de har har.  Dead people voting  has been one of the GOP s drumbeats regarding voter fraud for a long time, and, of course, on their planet, voter fraud actually only occurs when Democrats are able to vote. Early voting is one of those areas, but absentee voting, for some reason, isn t.Gee, could it be because the majority of people who cast absentee ballots in North Carolina are white, elderly and Republican? The majority of people who cast ballots during early voting are primarily minority and Democrat. From a reasonable perspective, if North Carolina were really worried about dead people voting, they should be targeting absentee voting, not early voting.North Carolina does have a law requiring that voters be alive on Election Day for their votes to be counted, even if they cast an early or absentee ballot. There are, however, contingencies in effect should someone who voted early die before Election Day. They re outlined by North Carolina Board of Elections general counsel Josh Lawson, below: All early voting is done on retrievable ballots,  he said.  If a person dies, the county board of elections is notified by the Social Security Administration or the Registrar of Deeds. They have a pretty good system for tracking deaths. When we become aware of it, we remove that ballot.' North Carolina is busy what-iffing itself off the edge of the sanity cliff here. With each comment, they increasingly prove that their voter suppression law was all about suppressing the minority vote.Featured image by Sara D.

" This ‘Duck Dynasty’ Star Wants To Baptize Donald Trump, And It’s As Crazy As It Sounds (VIDEO)","When thinking about this election, it s probably about the weirdest and craziest one that s happened in a long, long time. Maybe ever. However, just when you think it couldn t get weirder, something even more bizarre happens.While speaking at the Value Voters Summit this past Saturday, reality television personality Phil Robertson of the show  Duck Dynasty  declared that in order to really get God on their side, presumably that of washed up reality TV stars (himself and Donald Trump), then he s to baptize Trump. Not only that but to also film it for all to see. You know, because that s what God would want   to make a mockery of a very spiritual and personal moment to try and get votes for a known bigot.Robertson said: Donald, don t miss this. We need God on our side. I m just trying to give him some encouraging words  If you really want to see something wild, film it, Donald, film me baptizing you. The left-wingers will literally go crazy and the evangelicals will swarm you like a mighty thrall because then we would know we have God on our side.

 MSNBC Host Has PERFECT Response To Coughing GOPer Who Mocked Clinton’s Health (VIDEO),"Ever since Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was forced to leave the 9/11 memorial in New York City yesterday due to health concerns (she was diagnosed with pneumonia), conservatives have been giddy and going insane with accusations that the former Secretary of State is in no condition to be president.MSNBC host Thomas Roberts had the perfect response to all the hype about Clinton s health on Monday when he had Republican National Committee (RNC) Communications Director Sean Spicer on his show   and it s going to make the GOP furious while the rest of us laugh. During the live interview with Spicer, Roberts suggested that the Republican might have pneumonia because he coughed   a nod to the obsession conservative media has had with Clinton s health ever since she recently had a coughing fit during a rally.Roberts had been questioning Spicer about Republican nominee Donald Trump s charity work when Spicer coughed and cleared his throat. Without skipping a beat, Roberts jumped in and asked, Is that pneumonia? Spicer insisted that it was  just a cough  and Roberts moved on, asking Spicer if Trump would ever dare to release his taxes. Roberts asked, So before election day, yes or no, do you think we ll get them? Spicer replied, That s up to him to decide,  and Roberts followed up by asking the RNC official, Do you care? Spicer gave basically the same response Trump did several days ago, by saying,  I don t think that s really top of mind for the American people right now    even though it definitely is. Even Trump s own supporters have been begging him to release his tax returns!Robert wrapped up the interview with yet another subtle dig at the GOP. He said, Alright, Sean, good to have you with me. I m glad that the cough is just that: a cough.

 Scott Baio Tries To Push Hillary’s ‘Body Double’ Conspiracy And Fails MISERABLY (TWEETS),"Yesterday, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was forced to leave the 9/11 memorial in New York City after falling ill.Although there was a perfectly reasonable explanation for why the former Secretary of State had to leave the event early (she was diagnosed with pneumonia), anti-Clinton conspiracy theorists have been working overtime to smear Clinton s name after she reappeared out of her daughter Chelsea s apartment not too long after being pushed into a car by her security team. This had wannabe online detectives going nuts and analyzing the photos, which lead to the #HillarysBodyDouble hashtag being created on Twitter   and who else would love to jump on this bandwagon more than Donald Trump lover Scott Baio?!Baio, who has had it out for Clinton for some time, did his best to further the conspiracy theory, and got a bit of karma in the process. Not only did Baio fail miserably in making Clinton look bad, but he managed to make HIMSELF look like a complete dumba** in the process. In a tweet, the actor mentioned an actress who is known for her amazing Clinton impersonations, calling her out: Does anyone know the whereabouts of this woman today? Was she in NYC? Lol TwitterThe woman Baio is talking about is Teresa Barnwell, whose website hillaryclintonimpersonator.com boasts the actress  ability to be a near spitting image of the former Secretary of State. Here s a screenshot of her homepage:Teresa BarnwellBut of course, just like his favorite presidential candidate, Baio hadn t bothered to actually check the facts and do his research (sound familiar?). If he had only checked Barnwell s Twitter account that day, he would have known not to ask. The actress tweeted Baio back, shutting his whole conspiracy down: I m in Los Angeles today. Not in NYC!

It s great that Barnwell personally responded to Baio, and told him to shut the f*ck up in her own special way!Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Editors For Two Major Outlets Would Risk Jail If It Meant Getting Trump’s Taxes Out To The Public,"While the mainstream media and the Hillary-haters go on about her health and her campaign s refusal to disclose her pneumonia, two editors for major newspapers are thinking that Trump s taxes are still a really big deal. A huge deal. So gigantic a deal that they d be willing to go to jail if it meant making them public.Dean Baquet, executive editor for The New York Times, and Bob Woodward, associate editor for the Washington Post, recently attended a forum where they spoke with Laura Poitras, the award-winning filmmaker behind Edward Snowden s story. Poitras asked them both if they would publish Trump s taxes should they get hold of them. Both editors said yes, and they would argue with the lawyers who would warn against that course of action to do it. Baquet, explaining his reasoning, said Trump s  whole campaign is built on his success as a businessman, and his wealth  and the tax returns could shed light on that. Some things you have to do,  Woodward said in agreeing with Baquet. Trump doesn t have anything to hide, obviously, which is why his own running mate has released 10 years  worth of taxes, but Trump himself hasn t released a single page. He keeps hiding behind an audit, even when told repeatedly that Richard Nixon released his taxes while being audited and the IRS itself saying that excuse is full of bull cookies.The thing is, Trump and his businesses do so much with money that he could be under audit forever, meaning we ll never get to see the sheer perfection and wonder that are that man s tax returns. In truth, there s a growing possibility that those amazing returns aren t so amazing, and will make Trump look worse than he already does.Trump could take a page from Mitt Romney, who paid a hefty price for waiting to release his returns, but he thinks Mitt s choice to finally release them is what cost him the election. Maybe he s afraid the same thing will happen to him.Trump s charitable donations, such as they are, have been under scrutiny, his business practices have come into question, and there are some who are even questioning his overall wealth. If his taxes reveal a whole lot of underhandedness and flat-out lies (which they likely do), nobody with working brain cells will trust him.Trump has also said he works very hard to pay as little tax as possible, which doesn t sit well with many Americans. Maybe his tax returns show how he gets out of paying taxes in a way we little people, who he promises to stand for, can t.There s all sorts of speculation about why he won t release his returns. But he should watch out   there are two editors for two major newspapers who would risk going to jail if it meant making that information public.Featured image by Brian Blanco/Getty Images",News,"September 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Judge Faces Firing After Asking Rape Victim ‘Why Couldn’t You Just Keep Your Knees Together?’ (VIDEO),"Rape culture is not just an American problem, but rather an international epidemic. The latest proof of this is a Canadian judge who is facing firing after he asked a rape victim in his courtroom a litany of appalling questions. He implied that she was at fault for the sexual assault rather than her attacker because, after all, she probably wanted to have sex anyway.The allegations against Federal Court Justice Robin Camp are listed on the Canadian Judicial Council website. During the 2014 sexual assault trial, Camp reportedly asked the victim the following horrific question: Why couldn t you just keep your knees together? Why didn t you just sink your bottom down into the basin so he couldn t penetrate you? He also reportedly told her that young women want to have sex, particularly if they re drunk. As if those comments weren t disgusting enough, he also told the victim that  some sex and pain sometimes go together  and  that s not necessarily a bad thing. The woman had accused Alexander Wagar of holding her over a sink and brutally raping her during a house party. In September 2014, Camp acquitted Wagar of all charges. The woman appealed and Camp s ruling was overturned by the Alberta Court of Appeals and he is set for a new trial in November.In November of 2015, the Canadian Judicial Council began investigating Camp after a complaint was filed against him by four law professors. As a result, Camp later recused himself from all sexual assault cases. Not long after, members of the public began filing complaints as well.The Alberta attorney general filed a formal complaint against Camp in December and the matter was referred to  inquiry committee,  which consists of three judges and two lawyers. It will be up to this committee to decide if Camp will be removed from the bench.The Houston Chronicle reports that  according to the notice of allegations, Camp s  rude and derogatory  comments  belittle(d) and trivialize(d) the nature of the allegations.  He also made  stereotypical assumptions about how someone confronted with sexual assault would or would not behave.' CBC News reported that the woman said the judge s abhorrent comments made her hate herself. He made me feel like I should have done something, like I was some kind of a slut,  she said.Camp says he s very sorry for his behavior and Frank Addario, his attorney, said he has   consistently shown remorse  for berating the rape victim. Since then, he has reportedly tried  to educate himself and gain insight into his beliefs. Addario insists that Camp should not be removed from the bench because even though he made  insensitive and inappropriate  comments this can be remedied by education. The Chronicle adds that Camp has since  gone through mentoring, counseling about how victims of abuse respond to trauma, and a crash course on the history and current state of sexual assault law. Camp, who grew up in South Africa, received degrees in commerce and law from the University of Stellenbosch but claims he never received any training in how to handle sexual assault cases. In Canada, his practice has mostly dealt with cases involving contractual, trust, oil and gas, and bankruptcy litigation.Watch more here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Wells Fargo To Give Strikingly Fat Reward To Top Exec For Ripping Off Customers,"Wells Fargo, one of the biggest banks in the U.S., was recently caught running a scam known as  sandbagging,  to inflate bankers  numbers and get them more money. Basically, they were opening fake accounts and transferring customers  money into those accounts without their authorization. They ve been slapped with $185 million in fines, but the executive who is most closely and directly linked to this scam is walking away with a nice, fat reward for it at the end of the year, when she retires.Carrie Tolstedt, the head of Wells Fargo s Scamming Department, will receive almost $125 million at the end of this year despite being in charge of a department that ripped off its customers to inflate its own bottom lines. Of course, as is standard procedure whenever a big company is caught ripping people off, Wells Fargo isn t admitting any wrongdoing, even though this has been going on for the last five years.Tolstedt herself isn t saying anything about it, either, but Wells Fargo is praising her service, saying she s been  a standard bearer of our culture  and  a champion for customers. Yeah, right, charging your customers fees they don t owe because you put their money into accounts they didn t open to inflate your bottom line is being a champion for customers. At least the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau saw right through that drivel: It is quite clear that [the actions of Tolstedt s unit] are unfair and abusive practices under federal law,  said Cordray.  They are a violation of trust and an abuse of trust.' Wells Fargo has fired some 5,300 employees for these tactics, but their clawback provision, which they expanded after the 2008 financial crash, didn t seem to deter this department, and they kept up these secret and deceptive practices. It s bad enough that Elizabeth Warren, who s been after the big banks since she was elected in 2012, wants hearings into Wells Fargo s sandbagging. She doesn t believe Wells Fargo didn t know about the fake accounts any more than anyone with any sense does: Come on this went on for years and they didn t smell anything in the air about fake accounts? And if they did, she believes, then Wells Fargo is too big to manage. Either way, they defrauded their customers and should pay. As should the head of their department.Instead, Wells Fargo has decided to send a message to other banking executives that this kind of behavior is okay. It s the same problem we ve had with the big banks since before 2008. Tolstedt should be fired, and walk away with nothing.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"September 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ivanka Trump Shares Famous Jewish Quote, But Hilariously Credits Harry Potter Star (IMAGE)","Ordinarily, it s not cool to go after a presidential candidate s family, but seeing as Ivanka Trump, daughter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, is so active within the campaign, sorry, this is totally fair game.Ivanka, taking to both Twitter and Instagram to presumably share one of her favorite quotes with the many who follow her, posted: If not me, who? If not now, when? Which, ordinarily, is quite apropos for a person to post especially during a presidential campaign despite whether you think it s accurate or not.There s one big problem, however, she credited the quote not to its originator Hillel the Elder, an extremely important person in Jewish history, but rather to Harry Potter star Emma Watson.See more #ITwisewords: https://t.co/KzEUXBsXFb #quote #inspiration pic.twitter.com/mWFdLSxaL3  Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) September 9, 2016Watson, who is also notably a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, used the quote in her famous speech from 2014.

 WATCH: Republican Kentucky Governor Calls For Bloody Rebellion If Hillary Clinton Is Elected,"While Donald Trump is urging gun owners to assassinate Hillary Clinton before the election, Kentucky GOP Governor Matt Bevin is suggesting a bloody rebellion if she is elected.In a move that should make Kentucky voters hang their heads in shame, Bevin appeared before a crowd at the Values Voter Summit on Saturday and instantly made conservative  Christians  even more paranoid and bloodthirsty than they already were by claiming that Hillary Clinton is a tyrant who will destroy America if she is allowed to be in charge for very long. We don t have multiple options,  he said.  We re going one way or we re going the other way, politically, spiritually, morally, economically, from a liberty standpoint. We re going one way or we re going the other way. Bevin painted liberals as un-American for preventing conservative  Christians  from declaring America a Christian nation and instituting the Bible as the law of the land in place of the Constitution. They try to silence us. They try to get us to shut our mouths. They try to embarrass us. Don t be embarrassed. We were not redeemed to have a spirit of timidity. Be bold. There s enough Neville Chamberlains in the world. Be a Winston Churchill There are quite enough sheep already. Be a shepherd. After declaring that  America is worth fighting for, ideologically,  Bevin suggested spilling blood if that s what it takes to keep Hillary Clinton and the Democrats out of power. Somebody asked me yesterday, I did an interview and they said,  Do you think it s possible, if Hillary Clinton were to win the election, do you think it s possible that we ll be able to survive? That we would ever be able to recover as a nation? And while there are people who have stood on this stage and said we would not, I would beg to differ. But I will tell you this: I do think it would be possible, but at what price? At what price? The roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what? The blood, of who? The tyrants to be sure, but who else? The patriots. Whose blood will be shed? It may be that of those in this room. It might be that of our children and grandchildren. I have nine children. It breaks my heart to think that it might be their blood that is needed to redeem something, to reclaim something, that we through our apathy and our indifference have given away. Here s the video via YouTube:Earlier this year at one of his rallies, Donald Trump suggested that  Second Amendment people  could do something to prevent Hillary Clinton from picking Supreme Court nominees. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people   maybe there is, I don t know. And now a very extreme conservative Republican governor is taking that idea and running with it, proving that Hillary was right to call Trump supporters deplorable.Featured Image: Screenshot ",News,"September 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Veteran Doesn’t Want Your Thanks, He Wants You To Vote For Hillary","Marine Corps Veteran Frank Biggio appreciates your recognition of his services, but he doesn t want it anymore. This year is far too important. Instead, he says, he wants you to vote and he wants you to vote for Hillary Clinton.In an op-ed in Cleveland.com, Biggio outlined strong differences between the two major party candidates, and for him, Trump is unacceptable:One of our options includes a man who has glibly spoken about using nuclear weapons in Europe and the Middle East and seems unconcerned about nuclear proliferation by other countries simply because it is  going to happen anyway;  who fails to comprehend the deterrent effect of U.S. troops in South Korea against increasingly belligerent threats by North Korea; who would allow NATO member states on Russia s western border to fall to Kremlin aggressions unless they  pay up;  and who has denigrated the family of an Army captain killed in action while serving his country.This is a mercurial man who will have almost unchecked authority to put uniformed men and women in harm s way, but whose understanding of foreign affairs and military strategy is based almost solely on his instincts rather than analysis.Biggio goes on to say that he has served under many commanders and none of them have resorted to  primitive and distracting antics like belligerent shouting or chest thumping.  He also wrote about how every commander he s served under is humble with victories and takes responsibility for failures. Trump, he said, would never credit his team for success and he d never take blame for failure. Instead, Biggio compared Trump to the fictional Captain Queeg in  The Caine Mutiny :Trump is no Eisenhower. He s more like the fictional Captain Queeg played by Humphrey Bogart in  The Caine Mutiny    paranoid, erratic, condescending and ultimately incompetent. There are many other apt analogies, but each is equally frightening when thinking of Trump directing the deployment of our military to today s ambiguous front lines, perhaps just to prove that he can.Biggio is concerned for the 2.2 million members of the military if Trump is elected:Will we elect a man who, without offering any clarity, boasts that he  will be so good at the military, your head will spin,  as if his high school graduation from a military academy validates that claim, and hopes that the electorate will simply trust that will be so? Whose behavior and public comments cause a collective group of 50 foreign policy experts, most of whom are from the Republican Party and have at one time sat in the White House Situation Room and contemplated the implications   and repercussions   of deploying our military, to publicly denounce him and the security and foreign policy positions he has proposed?Biggio agrees with many that Clinton is not without flaws (who is?), but he admires and respects her experience, her pragmatism and the fact that she knows when to be decisive and when to exhibit restraint:This Election Day, please thank me for my service by voting for Hillary Clinton as our president and commander in chief.We will, Major Biggio.Featured image via Cherie Cullen/Getty Images.

 Trump Suggests Banning Moderators At Debates: Matt Lauer ‘Was Tough On Me’,"Matt Lauer s performance as moderator of the IAVA Commander-in-Chief Forum was roundly slammed, but according to Donald Trump, the morning show host was not easy on him. So, Donald has come up with a way for the debates to treat him fairly.  The GOP thin-skinned presidential nominee thinks there should be no moderators.Donald pulled the  system is being gamed  card. As far as the debates are concerned, the system is being gamed because everybody said that I won the debate, you know, the so-called forum that your group put on,  Trump said.  But they all said I won and that Matt Lauer was easy on me. Well he wasn t. He was   I thought he was very professional, I have to be honest. I think he s been treated very unfairly, but they all said that I won, and what they re doing is they re gaming the system so that when I go into the debate, I m gonna get   be treated very, very unfairly by the moderators. Donald added that Lauer,  wasn t nice to me. He was tough on me. He gave me tough [questions]. I answered them better than she did. That must have been a different debate than the one we all watched. #LaueringTheBar quickly trended on Twitter. Lauer interrupted Hillary repeatedly while letting Donald speak without calling out the Republican candidate s lies. Meanwhile, Edward Murrow is spinning in his grave. The fact is, that they re gaming the system, and I think, maybe, we should have no moderator,  Donald said.  Let Hillary and I sit there and just debate because I think the system is being rigged so it s gonna be a very unfair debate, and I can see it happening right now because everyone s saying that he was soft on Trump,  he continued.  Well now the new person s gonna try to be really hard on Trump just to show, you know, the establishment what he can do. So I think it s very unfair what they re doing. So I think we should have a debate with no moderators   just Hillary and I sitting there talking. On Monday, Trump-backing CNN contributor Jeffrey Lord echoed Donald s thoughts on banning moderators for the debates. Has anyone seen Lord and Trump in the same room together? They might be the same person. They sure sound exactly alike.If Donald is afraid of a moderator, then he wouldn t fare well in talks with a world leader.Featured image via  Mark Wallheiser/Getty",News,"September 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Derby Event Asks Crowd To Stand For Confederate Flag, Forcing Police Officer To Sit During National Anthem","It s one thing to have a choice to sit to during the national anthem, but it s something else entirely when one is forced to do so.Prior to a demolition derby event in West Jordan, Utah, police officer Daniel Argueta and his family were forced to sit during the Star Spangled Banner because the truck carrying the American flag also carried a Confederate flag, which Stirrin  Dirt Racing owner Jim Simko blamed on  helpers  by claiming it was added shortly before the anthem.But that s not true according to Argueta, who says the Confederate flag was positioned on the truck a full hour before the anthem took place. In other words, there was plenty of time to remove the flag but it wasn t.As a result, the crowd was asked to stand and salute a racist flag of traitors alongside the stars and stripes.And that s why Argueta and his family chose to sit instead. You kind of get caught in, yes, you want to stand, you support the U.S. flag,  Argueta told KSTU-TV.  You support the troops, you support police officers, but what is the Confederate flag doing there? For anybody that knows history and understands the negative impact of that flag and how it s been used historically, it s hard to stand up. The Confederate flag has drawn much outrage in recent years, especially after white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine black parishioners at a church in South Carolina. The state finally removed the Confederate flag that had been flying for decades outside the statehouse, which had been raised in protest of civil rights.Simko tried to excuse the presence of the Confederate flag by arguing that people should be free to fly it. It wasn t politically correct, I m sure, for some people, but there s some people who look at that flag and say this is the land of the free,  Simko said.  It shouldn t have happened, but I can t, unfortunately, watch what everybody does at every minute. Again, Simko had 60 minutes to make sure it didn t happen and he did nothing. Also, individuals have the freedom to fly the flag all they want on their private property. But this event forced people to salute a flag that had no business flying during our national anthem. It was humiliating,  Argueta said. It was demeaning, because with all the controversy going on with the flag recently and people sitting during the anthem, we had all intended to stand, but we couldn t. People probably looked around, probably wondering what we were doing. Here s the video via KSTU.The reason why athletes such as Colin Kaepernick are sitting during the national anthem is because they are protesting police brutality and racial inequality. They have the right to make that choice and so far it has brought attention to the issues they want to highlight.Of course, if a pastor in Alabama had his way, the Argueta family and all of these athletes would be lined up against a wall and executed for not standing, thus demonstrating that conservatives don t really understand what freedom is at all.Featured image via Deseret News",News,"September 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rocker Marilyn Manson Is Thrilled That Fox News Is Imploding,"Fox News is falling apart and no one is happier than Marilyn Manson, who was one of their biggest targets in the 1990s.Sexual harassment scandals and an exodus of top talent combined with an aging audience has put great strain on the conservative network in recent months. Millions of dollars has been lost and Fox s reputation as a defender of  family values  among conservatives has taken a major hit.Most of the public is cheering for Fox News  collapse, bu shock rocker Marilyn Manson is cheering louder.Back in the 1990s, Fox News viciously attacked Manson and his music and falsely blamed him for the Columbine mass school shooting, which led to Manson appearing on the show to humiliate Bill O Reilly.During an interview with the Daily Beast, Manson talked about Fox News and expressed his joy at watching the network fall after being asked if he gets a  sense of satisfaction out of seeing Fox News and its former chief Roger Ailes get its comeuppance? Fox News was just starting up and Columbine was really their platform that launched them. They used me and I enjoyed going up against Bill O Reilly. I remember being in their building and walking right past Shepard Smith, and he was the one who d reported on Columbine inaccurately. He was the one saying [the shooters] were wearing Marilyn Manson makeup and shirts which none of that was true and I walked right past him and gave him the f*cking dead eye. And Bill O Reilly was so ill-prepared, I loved handing him his ass. So yeah, it s been fun watching them go down. Roger Ailes was forced to resign after it was revealed that he spent years sexually harassing female employees, including Gretchen Carlson and Andrea Tantaros, both of whom filed lawsuits against Fox. Tantaros  lawsuit is ongoing but Carlson recently settled hers and received $20 million from the network and an apology.Speaking of Bill O Reilly, he is named in Tantaros  lawsuit, which must bring even more of a smile to Manson s face.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"September 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Wikileaks Admits To Screwing Up IMMENSELY With Twitter Poll On Hillary’s Health,"Wikileaks, which is more a conspiracy enterprise than it is a whistleblowing watchdog these days, put up a poll on Twitter that asked users to tell them which health issue they thought was causing Hillary s coughing fits and  unusual body movements.  All four of their answers have been bandied about by conservatives everywhere, as they try and diagnose Hillary in a frantic attempt to prove she s unfit to be President.They ve since deleted the poll and put a tweet in its place that s supposed to be a sort of retraction and apology, or as close as Wikileaks will ever get to admitting they royally screwed up. However, the Internet is keeping the poll and publishing it everywhere they can. Buzzfeed s Andrew Kaczynski republished a screencap of it while needling Wikileaks about transparency, since that s what Wikileaks was supposed to be about before they turned into conspiracy theorists with a hate-on for Hillary:.@wikileaks deleted their tweet. Obviously in the nature of openness & transparency I have preserved it right here: pic.twitter.com/IdrgFlxP3A  andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) September 11, 2016Wikileaks  apparently didn t like the flack they were catching for that poll, though, and tweeted out their non-apology accordingly: We removed our earlier poll on what people perceive are the reasons for Clinton s medical issues as the possibilities are too speculative.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) September 11, 2016They should know that poll is never going to die, though, and their non-apology is almost as insulting as the poll. They revel in this kind of thing, along with the backlash involved   in fact, they have yet to remove the credit card information of DNC donors from their collection of the hacked emails, despite the outrage over that.Hillary left the 9/11 event she was attending early and appeared to collapse before being helped into a van. Her campaign later revealed that she d been diagnosed with pneumonia, and that she was overheated and dehydrated, which can happen when someone s sick and in the sun. Her doctor later said that she was recovering nicely from this episode.Seeing as how a lot of people have completely forgotten, here s a little reminder that this isn t unprecedented: In 2002, George W. Bush passed out in the White House after eating a pretzel. After eating a pretzel. Apparently, it went down wrong and  stimulated a nerve that decreased his heart rate.  Enough for him to faint.But Hillary momentarily succumbing to an illness while standing in the sun is some sort of scandal. Right.The medical term for what happened to Bush is vasovagal syncope, and it s actually quite common. So are run-of-the-mill respiratory infections that lead to pneumonia when left unchecked, even in presidential candidates. Hillary s schedule has been grueling, to say the least, and yet she s supposed to either be a super woman and never get sick, or admit that even the merest cold means she s too sick to run for President.The haters, however, are looking for any shred of evidence they can find that  proves  Hillary is unfit to serve. Wikileaks decided to take it too far.Featured image by Carl Court/Getty Images",News,"September 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jamelle Bouie Says Science Proves Half Of GOP Are Deplorable (VIDEO),"The right-wing was quick to claim that Clinton had experienced her own  47% moment  with her  basket full of deplorables  remark. But nothing could be further from the truth. Clinton s remark turns out to be fairly accurate.In fact, if anything Clinton actually undersold just how deplorable Trump s supporters actually are. During an appearance on CBS s Face the Nation on Sunday, Slate s chief political correspondent, Jamelle Bouie explained how the statement Clinton made is supported by scientific evidence.Bouie looked at polling data that showed that more than half of Republicans believe that President is a Muslim or was born in another country. So, I m inclined to see it as strategy and not so much as a gaffe because when I heard the remark, my first question was: Well, is this true? Right? Regardless of how it sounds, what it looks like, what is the case about Donald Trump supporters?  Bouie asks.  And if you break down the numbers and you look at the RealClearPolitics average, and it gives Trump, 43 percent of the registered voters, there re about 30, 31 million people. Compare that to polls show 65 to 70 percent of all Republicans who say that Barack Obama either wasn t born in the United States or is a Muslim. If one doesn t think that believe that birtherism is a bad enough belief to hold to earn the title of deplorable, then Bouie has the data to show that roughly have of Republicans are racist. You look at pilot data from the American National Election Study, and it shows upward of 40 percent of Republicans saying things like blacks are more violent, blacks are lazier, Muslims are more violent, Muslims are lazier,  Bouie points out. Among Trump supporters in particular, 60, 50, 70 percent of them agree with statements that political scientists categorize as being explicitly racist,  Bouie continues.  So I m looking at Clinton s statement, and half, which is about 31 million people again, doesn t really seem that out of bounds. Forty to 50 percent of Republicans, I would say looking at the full spectrum of data, agree with beliefs that we would categorize as explicitly prejudiced. So regardless of whether or not Clinton needs to walk it back or not, I think she s being correct and accurate. Conservatives are angry at Clinton because they still cannot accept that pointing out bigotry and racism do not make the person bringing it up racist. Clinton may have half-heartedly backtracked on her statement; her sentiment was worded poorly even if it was accurate.As Bakari Sellers pointed out on Sunday While on CNN s State of the Union, it doesn t matter how many of Trump s supporters are bigoted racists or not because they are all supporting a candidate who is a bigot.There is no left-wing conspiracy out there to make Republicans and trump supporters like deplorable. As polling indicates, they self-identify as being racist bigots on their own.You can watch the clip below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"September 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here’s The REAL Reason Hillary Clinton Left That 9/11 Memorial Early Sunday,"It seemed like it took exactly 30 seconds for every person on the right-wing to take Hillary Clinton s early departure from a 9/11 memorial as proof that she is suffering from some severe medical disorder. In reality, Clinton did actually become overheated. Her medical doctor released a statement that explains that Clinton is currently suffering from pneumonia. It explains why she has been coughing on the campaign trail and why she needed to leave the event she was attending in New York.Politico reports that Clinton s physician, Lisa Bardack released a statement saying: Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morning s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely. Shocking. It s almost as if Clinton is a human being who gets sick. Pneumonia can, of course, turn deadly. However, given the medical miracles of the modern age, she ll probably be fine.  Just as Clinton s doctor, who you know, actually has a medical degree, and who examined her just today after the incident says she will be.Thanks to right-wing blowhards such as Sean Hannity, this bizarre health conspiracy has gone totally mainstream. It really says a lot about the power that the right-wing has harnessed when it comes to the media, both in traditional and online formats. They managed to turn a brief clip of Clinton falling while being rushed into a car into absolute proof that Clinton is suffering from Alzheimer s disease or whatever they believe she has this week.Welcome to the era of Alex Jones-like mass media speculation.Featured image from  Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Pharma Bro’ Just Yelled This At Hillary To Remind Us He’s Still A MASSIVE Douche (VIDEO),"You may have heard that Hillary Clinton had a minor medical episode on Sunday, that resulted in her leaving a 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York. After she left, Clinton went to her daughter s apartment. Outside of the apartment, reporters and others questioned Clinton as to what her current medical state is. Among the crowd was Martin Shkreli, a.k.a  Pharma Bro .While outside of the apartment, Shkreli shouted  stupid stuff  as he put it on Twitter at Hillary Clinton. He uploaded video evidence of his douchbaggery online. Shkreli shouted things such as  Are you still alive?  and  Do you need Pharma Bro s help?  As well as saying,  Go Trump. Shkreli definitely hit the nail on the head when describing his comments.Me yelling stupid stuff at Hillary: https://t.co/AhlAt24lVd  Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 11, 2016I enjoyed screaming ""why are you so sick"" and ""go trump"" at @HillaryClinton . Get well soon bae!

Imagine she isn t a public figure running to take over the Oval Office. Clinton is a 68-year-old woman who appears to have suffered from a case of heat stroke. It turns out Clinton has pneumonia.I know that this is a man whose only real claim to fame is being almost universally hated for jacking up the price of an essential HIV medication 4,000 percent for no apparent reason other than to raise profits. Yet, while doing that he was operating under capitalist imperatives to do so. It isn t right, but price gauging is currently all the rage in the pharmaceutical industry.Mocking a person for having a medical issue is just plain sadistic. What s worse is the fact that there is an audience out there who is willing to listen and encourage this type of behavior. Judging by the comments it is mostly Trump supporters who found the scene to be absolutely hilarious. It s sad that segments of the right-wing have decided to throw away any pretense of having basic human decency.Featured image from screenshot ",News,"September 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Facebook’s Bad Week Of ‘Trending News’ Ends With The Most Tone-Deaf 9/11 Topic Imaginable,"Today s a somber day of remembrance for the lives lost 15 years ago in the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, United Flight 93, and all the sacrifices made since then. Social media has been tracking 9/11 topics for the last several days, as they should, but two days ago, Facebook also decided to feature a story that s nothing but a truther conspiracy in its  trending topics  sidebar.9/11 truthers are conspiracy theorists loudly proclaiming that the attacks were an inside job. This particular story was from a U.K. tabloid site called The Daily Star, and it says (because of course it does): Engineers Steven Jones, Robert Korol, Anthony Szamboti and Ted Walter are part of the growing community of experts who say evidence indicates the towers were brought down in a controlled demolition.They wrote a paper for Europhysics News highlighting four important pieces of evidence pointing to this conclusion.These were: fires are not normally hot enough to heat a massive steel structure enough for it to collapse; the majority of high rise buildings have sprinkler systems that prevent a fire from getting hot enough to heat steel to a critical level; skyskrapers (sic) are protected using flame-proof materials and they are also designed so that if compromised, they do not collapse. Spelling errors aside, there is actually a wealth of evidence showing that the Twin Towers did not have adequate fireproofing on their superstructures. Not to mention that these four engineers are well-known truthers immune to actual science and fact. They re  experts,  though, and must be taken seriously. Not.But that s beside the point.Facebook recently got rid of all its trained journalists for its  trending  section. Zuckerberg said that the change was because they re a platform, not a content creator (the truth probably has more to do with money than that, but Facebook won t admit it). Yet, the result has been awful. A false story about Megyn Kelly. A man using a McChicken sandwich for sexual pleasure. A satire piece about Siri coming out of the iPhone 8 and cooking. BreitAnd now, an impossibly disrespectful story about the alleged truth of the 9/11 attacks. That trivializes everyone who died, everyone who worked rescue, everyone who s sick from working rescue, everyone who lost family members, our military men and women who died in Afghanistan trying to find Osama bin Laden and take down the Taliban, and the experiences of the entire country during and following that tragic day.While it s true that trending topics will include topics and stories we disagree with, for this to be one of the top trending stories just prior to the 15th anniversary of those attacks shows just how clueless, cold and insensitive Facebook has become without its real, bona fide journalists to determine trending topics.It seems that Facebook s decision to automate, automate, automate was one of the worst ideas in the long, sad history of bad ideas. Fortunately, this story was removed from their trending topics list, but the Internet never forgets.Featured image by Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images",News,"September 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bakari Sellers: Not All Trump Supporters Are Bigots But They Support One (VIDEO),"Political analyst Bakari Sellers appeared on CNN s State of the Union Sunday where he defended Clinton s  basket of deplorables  statement and explained why he and voters of color are terrified of Trump.Diane Black, a Republican Congresswoman from Tennessee called for both candidates to tone down their name-calling: I think for presidential candidates; they need to get away from this name-calling on both sides. This is about teaching our children and our grandchildren on how to act. Of how to have healthy relationship with other people who disagree with you. Sellers shot back at Black, saying: I don t have much respect for bigots, for misogynists, for xenophobes,  he told her.  For him to embrace that at certain points   I was backstage, on set, when Jake Tapper asked him multiple times about David Duke, and he embraced that. He did not repudiate that. Sellers didn t stop there. He continued his condemnation of Trump supporters, saying that: There s a certain point when you have to take some leadership and say that is not what this country is built upon. The people who wear Confederate flag T-shirts at the rallies and say  let s make America great again ? That petrifies me. It literally petrifies me, because that is not what our country is about. It s interesting to witness the conservative backlash against Hillary Clinton s  deplorables  comment. Clinton s biggest problem with regards to the matter was her apologizing for the comment. The comment wasn t meant to be an in-depth dissection of Trump s supporters. At least a significant portion of Trump s supporters could be described as being deplorable, or at least hold deplorable views for that matter. Keep in mind, Trump has the support of just about every hate group in the United States behind him.Sellers makes his best point during the segment when he says that: Not all Donald Trump supporters are bigots. Not all of them, by any stretch. However, they do have to be okay with supporting a bigot. Sellers  commentary is spot on. Trump has used hateful, vile rhetoric towards just about every political minority in the United States. He doesn t have a coherent policy proposal in his platform and his supporters do not seem to care. That makes the idea of having an issues based election impossible to have.You can watch the segment below in full.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"September 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Poll: Clinton Leads Trump By 10 Points, Obama’s Approval Rating Skyrockets","While the media will have you believe Donald Trump is on the cusp of overtaking Clinton, the polls speak for themselves. After CNN got caught cooking the polls to benefit Trump, the Washington Post/ABC News came back with a dose of truth: Hillary Clinton is still trouncing Trump.Their most recent poll, released September 11, shows Clinton with a 10 point lead (45-35) over Trump among registered voters, and a five point lead (46-41) among likely voters. According to the poll, 7 in 10 voters have already made up their minds about who to vote for, while 3 in 10 say they are undecided or could change their mind in the coming months.However, Clinton should be worried when it comes to her supporters determination to voting in November:Trump s supporters report greater interest in the campaign and voting, which could factor into turnout. More than 6 in 10 registered voters who support Trump say they are following the campaign very closely, and 93 percent say they are absolutely certain to vote. By contrast, 45 percent of Clinton backers are paying close attention to the race, and 80 percent are certain to vote, while one-fifth say they will probably or are less likely to cast a ballot.Not all is bad news for Clinton. Trump is currently doing worse than Romney did in 2012 among white voters while Clinton is seeing a historic gain for Democrats amongst white college-educated women, a demographic that typically votes Republican. Clinton leads that category by 20 points.Clinton has also collected more support with Independent voters than Trump (39-37 percent). Earlier last month, Clinton was behind Trump with Independents.While Clinton will have to work harder to coalesce her supporters to vote (she has the numbers for an outright win) she does have another advantage: President Obama s extreme popularity.President Obama s approval rating has hit seven year high of 58 percent. Not since July 2009 has he enjoyed that much support.Here s why that helps Clinton: an incumbent president s approval rating is one factor that directly corresponds with how a candidate (of the same party) performs with voters, with other factors including economic standing, polls, etc.Don t believe he hub that Trump is  closing in  on Hillary Clinton. The only thing in the way of Clinton winning in a landslide is the 20 percent of Democratic voters that are apathetic. This is why Democrats need to get out and vote, not get cocky or complacent.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"September 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" As World Trade Center Fell, Donald Trump Boasted His Tower Was Now The Biggest In Manhattan","September 11 was arguably the worst day in American history. All Americans were shell-shocked, fearful, and lost in grief and confusion.Well, almost all Americans were grief stricken, except of course Donald Trump. In his typical form, Trump used an unimaginable horror to prop himself up and pat himself on the back.As the World Trade Center collapsed to the ground, Trump, in a by-phone T.V. interview, boasted that his building, 40 Wall Street, was now the tallest building in lower Manhattan.Reporter: You have one of the landmark buildings down in the financial district there, 40 Wall Street   uh   did you have any damage? What s happened down there?Trump: Oh, it s an amazing phone call I made, 40 Wall Street actually was the second tallest building in downtown Manhattan and it was actually before the World Trade Center was the tallest, and when they built the World Trade Center it became known as the second tallest. But now it s the tallest.Congratulations, Trump. As thousands of people lie dead in a mast of rubble and debris, you single handedly turn a national tragedy into praise for yourself and your buildings.Imagine if Hillary Clinton, who was Senator of New York at the time, had said something so incredibly offensive, so devoid of sympathy or empathy for New Yorkers.Of course his supporters   Republicans who exploit 9/11 to draw out our fears   will dismiss this as another liberal character assault. Coupled with his lies about Muslims, the theft of his  charity  for 9/11 survivors, it should come as no surprise that Donald Trump did not care on iota about what happened.Only a egomaniacal narcissist would take the opportunity to plug in his business as being the biggest (and thus the best) as an iconic hallmark of the world crumbles.Watch the exchange for yourself and share it with all your  patriotic  Trump-supporting friends and family.

 Alabama Pastor Says People Who Don’t Stand For National Anthem Should Be Executed,"And his church supported him.An Alabama  Christian  pastor told a crowd at a McKenzie High School football game that if they don t stand for the national anthem they should be lined up and executed by our military.Pastor Allen Joyner of the Sweet Home Baptist Church made the announcement prior to the match, therefore abusing his position as the school s game announcer. If you don t want to stand for the national anthem, you can line up over there by the fence and let our military personnel take a few shots at you since they re taking shots for you,  Joyner declared on Friday as the crowd cheered.Denise Crowley-Whitfield, who attended the game and heard Joyner s remarks, posted about them on Facebook but quickly deleted the post.Here s a screenshot of the post via AL.com.Joyner s church posted on their Facebook page that they support their pastor s statement but they were also forced to delete the post and actually went as far as deleting their account because they know how big of a shit storm they ve walked into.Clearly, Joyner was referencing San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and others who support him for sitting during the anthem in protest of police brutality and racial inequality that has run rampant in this country despite the delusions of white conservatives who believe otherwise.Conservatives have blown a gasket ever since Kaepernick began his protest, calling for him and any athlete who joins him to be thrown out of the country or worse for exercising his constitutional rights to free speech and protest.Butler County Schools Superintendent Amy Bryan did not make the mistake of supporting Joyner s remarks and roundly condemned them before suggesting that the school board may address the remarks and deal with Joyner at the next meeting. Patriotism should be a part of school events but threats of shooting people who aren t patriotic, even in jest, have no place at a school,  she said.  Threats of violence are a violation of school policy and certainly not condoned by the school board. According to AL.com, the most prominent condemnation of Joyner came from Air Force veteran Mark Bender, who commented on Sweet Home Alabama Baptist s Facebook post before the entire account was deleted. We fight so that all Americans retain their rights and freedoms to protest. I would never turn a weapon on my own countryman simply because they protest by remaining seated during the national anthem, by refusing to recite the pledge of allegiance, refusing to stand or pledge during any act. These things we do, these pledges, these songs, these are not compulsory acts. They are acts that we are all free to join or not.I am proud that we have that freedom whether or not I agree with someone s non-violent protest. You, on the other hand are promoting extremist violence by way of state sanctioned executions. You are obviously standing for the compulsory actions by way of preaching hatred, jingoism, American exceptionalism   all because people do not believe or think as you do. I am grateful that the majority of Americans do not thirst for their brother s blood as you do. You are a disgrace, those who agree with you are a disgrace, and you are a black mark upon this great nation. You should certainly hang your heads in shame. What this alleged  man of God  is advocating for is exactly what fascism looks like. This is nationalism at its most extreme and Joyner should be fired by his church and removed from his announcing job by the school. He literally called for murdering people who exercise their rights and that diminishes any alleged moral authority his church could claim as well as creates a more dangerous atmosphere for people who support Kaepernick, especially considering all of the gun nuts out there who are just crazy enough to use Joyner s remarks as a call to action. And he ll have blood on his hands if they pull the trigger.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"September 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Uncovered Audio Shows LIVID Hillary Clinton After 9/11 (VIDEO),"September 11, 2001, was not only the day of the biggest terrorist attack to hit American soil, it was also a test of politicians, especially in the Bush administration and those serving New York. Hillary Clinton was New York s Junior Senator at the time and in a newly uncovered video, she became livid at the Bush administration s lies, particularly about air quality after the attacks.First, a little background. The attacks of 9/11 had devastating affects for the country. It, after all, was the catalyst for two of the longest wars in America s history. Nearly 3,000 people died as a direct result of the planes hitting the Twin Towers, but as of last year, nearly 21,000 people have filed eligibility reports claiming they became sick in the aftermath.Some of the victims weren t even in New York at the time of the attacks, but they felt a need to help, so they traveled to New York. It s understandable if those people felt it was safe. After all, the Bush administration told us it was.A week after two hijacked passenger jets were flown into the towers of the World Trade Center, killing 2,753 people   184 died in the Pentagon in Washington DC and 40 were killed when a United Airlines plane came down in a field in Pennsylvania   (former Bush Environmental Protection Agency head, Christine Todd) Whitman issued a statement. It said:  I am glad to reassure the people of New York   that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink. Three days after the attacks, Whitman, who had previously been the Republican governor of New Jersey, told reporters:  The good news continues to be that air samples we have taken have all been at levels that cause us no concern. Source: The GuardianWhitman hasn t exactly acknowledged that she lied to the American people, but she has admitted that she s very sorry. I m very sorry that people are sick,  she said.  I m very sorry that people are dying and if the EPA and I in any way contributed to that, I m sorry. We did the very best we could at the time with the knowledge we had. She added:  Every time it comes around to the anniversary I cringe, because I know people will bring up my name, they blame me, they say that I lied and that people died because I lied, [they say] people have died because I made a mistake. I guess that s better than most members of the least introspective presidential administration in modern history.Hillary Clinton saw through it and she was livid, but as CNN s guest, Edward Pilkington of The Guardian, in the video below commented, she was also very well educated on the topic. He called her a  sponge for information. Here s the video:We know that Hillary Clinton is incredibly smart, that she does like to immerse herself in knowledge and in research, but this video shows her as incredibly passionate when it comes to her constituents, and isn t that we want in our leaders?Featured image via video screen capture.

 Former EPA Head FINALLY Admits She Was Wrong About Ground Zero Air Quality,"On the day before the 15th anniversary of September 11, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Republican Christie Todd Whitman, has finally admitted she was wrong about the air quality at Ground Zero.In the days following the crippling attack, Whitman reassured first responders and those cleaning up the wreckage that the public air quality was safe to breathe:I am glad to reassure the people of New York   that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drinkAs thousands of Americans suffer debilitating illness   and death   due to the toxicity of the, Whitman remained silent for years. Until now. Speaking to the Guardian, Whitman expressed immense guilt and regret for staying silent, and told the paper she still  feels awful  at the events that transpired:Whatever we got wrong, we should acknowledge and people should be helped. I m very sorry that people are sick,  she said.  I m very sorry that people are dying and if the EPA and I in any way contributed to that, I m sorry. We did the very best we could at the time with the knowledge we had. Every time it comes around to the anniversary I cringe, because I know people will bring up my name, they blame me, they say that I lied and that people died because I lied, [they say] people have died because I made a mistake.No doubt that Whitman feels ashamed. No doubt she is riddled with regret and guilt. But after 15 years she final decides to speak? After more than 1,100 people have been diagnosed with cancer related to the effects of Ground Zero   and nearly 900 first responders have died as of June 2009  the apology comes a little too late.The effects of Ground Zero have been know for years and years. Republicans have played politics with healthcare, and like Whitman, have not taken responsibility for their actions.As early as 2003, the Inspector General criticized the EPA s handling of the situation, and still no accountability or responsibility was taken. Whitman did resign, but contends it had nothing to do with the Inspector General s findings and instead stems from personal decisions after disagreements with Vice President Dick Cheney. Whitman had an opportunity to take responsibility, but chose not to.Republicans criticize Obama s response to Ebola, Zika, H1-N1, but look over Whitman and th Bush Administration s shameful ignorance ad deflection of the Ground Zero cancer cases.An apology fifteen years too late, but better late than never I suppose.Featured image via Aaron Davidson/Getty Images",News,"September 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Krystal Ball Hits Whiny Trump Supporter With Reality That ‘Deplorables’ Love His Campaign,"When a Donald Trump minion whined about Hillary Clinton referring to Trump supporters as a  basket of deplorables  Krystal Ball was there to destroy her with the truth.During a face-off between Ball and Scottie Nell Hughes on CNN on Saturday, Hughes threw a hissy fit because Hillary dared to slam Trump s racist hateful supporters and called her  desperate. The problem is that Trump s supporters are exactly what Hillary called them. They are deplorable racists who have stooped to bottom of the barrel politics. They have called for killing or imprisoning Hillary and have committed violence against black people at Trump rallies all while disparaging Latinos and calling President Obama a terrorist.And Krystal Ball had no sympathy for Hughes considering everything Trump supporters have said and done over the last year. To be honest with you, the truth hurts. I don t know that it s half of Trump supporters, but you can t deny the fact that you ve got the David Dukes of the world in his camp backing him strongly. You can t deny the fact that if you go on white nationalist website Stormfront, they love their glorious leader Donald Trump. You can t deny that when you go to his rallies you hear the N-word thrown around casually and Hillary Clinton referred to as the B-word.So, he has tapped into this very ugly stream in America I think it s frankly important to point out the kind of company you re keeping if you re going to back somebody like Donald Trump. And Ball is right. Trump s campaign is a sea full of racist bigots who hide under white sheets, think we should persecute Muslims, and think women should submit to the will of men.In fact, polling data backs up Hillary Clinton s remark.According to ThinkProgress, polls show that two-thirds of Trump s supporters think President Obama is a Muslim, which is not only Islamophobic, it s racist, too.Furthermore, 40 percent of Trump s supporters think black people are  lazy  and another 50 percent think black people are more violent than whites. One-third of them think putting Japanese-Americans in internment camps was a good idea. 20 percent think Lincoln should not have freed the slaves and 30 percent of Trump s fans in South Carolina want to ban gay people from living in the United States.So when Hillary Clinton said that half of Trump s supporters are deplorable she was damn spot on.But Hughes continued to whine, and not only did she defend white supremacists, she oozed hypocrisy. I don t agree with what Krystal said about those different groups, I think that it once again is just Hillary Clinton trying to divide. She doesn t want to unify Would you like me to sit there and say that Hillary Clinton is accountable for cop killings? Or for communism or anarchism or all of the crazy fringes that exist on the left right now? Here s the video via YouTube:Except that Trump and his supporters already regularly accuse Hillary Clinton of being a communist and have repeatedly blamed her and President Obama for the deaths of police officers. And unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton has never called for the assassination of her political opponent.It should also be pointed out that in addition to Hillary slamming Trump s deplorable supporters, she did express empathy for Trump supporters who have legitimate concerns,  people who feel the government has let them down, the economy let them down, nobody cares about them, those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well.

" Michelle Obama Posed for A Photo, So Conservatives Called Her A ‘Gorilla’ And ‘Tranny’ (SCREENSHOTS)","Recently, Michelle Obama posed for InStyle magazine. The First Lady was stunning in a custom-made teal dress by Brandon Maxwell   but of course conservatives had to sh*t all over it.A ridiculously named   yet somehow moderately popular   right-wing garbage fire of a Facebook page called The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense decided to give their take on the matter, posting the photo of our lovely First Lady with the following message:  What do you think of the new portrait of Moochelle by InStyle Magazine?  The numbskulls who visit the page are then instructed to  like  if they think it is Photoshopped and share the post if they are  still not convinced he s a she. Naturally, the denizens of Stupidville flocked to the opportunity, calling her every name they can think of and, thanks to the power of stupidity and a third grade education, even managing to accidentally make some up in their pursuit to out-stupid one another. Many, of course, leaped at the opportunity to fantasize about the First Lady being a man, with some even demanding to see her penis. Others stuck to the tried-and-true  let s just call her a monkey or ape and get it over with.

 How Trump Scammed New York For 9/11 Money He Didn’t Deserve,"Donald Trump has lied about how and why he received $150,000 from the New York state government which had been earmarked to help small businesses dealing with the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.Previously, Trump claimed the money was  probably a reimbursement for the fact that I allowed people, for many months, to stay in the building, use the building and store things in the building  and  The value of what I did was far greater than the money talked about, much of which was sent automatically to building owners in the area. A new expose from the New York Daily News reveals that documents that Trump s own company filed with the government show this to be a falsehood. The Daily News says:But those comments don t match the forms Trump s company submitted to the New York state government requesting the money for his property, The Trump Building, located at 40 Wall St.Those documents, exclusively obtained by The News from the Empire State Development Corporation which administered the recovery program, show Trump s company asked for those funds for  rent loss,   cleanup  and  repair    not to recuperate money lost in helping people.Even worse, Trump has previously admitted on the record that his property  wasn t affected by what happened to the World Trade Center,  but he took the money anyway.Officials also told the paper that if Trump had submitted forms to be reimbursed for letting people use the building, as he claims, it would have been rejected out of hand. The program was in place to help businesses get back on their feet after the devastating attack that killed thousands, not to pad the pockets of alleged billionaires.The 9/11 scam from Trump is part of a continuing pattern from the Republican presidential nominee, in which he has spread falsehoods, made questionable claims, and profited while others are left holding the bag. This case is just a little worse than the others for how he used the worst terrorist attack in American history as cover for sucking up money.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Took To Twitter To Proudly Defend Open Bigotry (TWEET),"Most of the media is capitalizing off what Hillary Clinton said at a recent LGBT event that was held in New York City. Unlike a Donald Trump gaffe every other hour, Hillary said something that bordered on inappropriate, albeit completely honest. She said that half of Trump s supporters are a  basket of deplorables.  In other words, they need to be called out on their blatant bigotry.Hillary said: To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the  basket of deplorables.  Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that and he has lifted them up   he tweets and retweets offensive, hateful, mean-spirited rhetoric. Hearing this from Hillary, Trump took this as a cue to defend the indefensible   the racists themselves. And yes, they are blatantly racist. In fact, he even called them  great Americans. Trump tweeted out: Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans! Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!  Donald J.

 Trump Adviser Just Proved Hillary’s ‘Basket Of Deplorables’ Comment Correct With One Image,"For some reason, the Trump campaign is utterly clueless about the alt-right movement and what it stands for. Trump himself regularly retweets stuff from those deplorable (oops, we said it) excuses for human beings and then brushes it off, if he even says anything at all. He even enthusiastically tweeted an image of himself as Pepe the Frog, a mascot for the Neo-Nazis, which is bad enough given that Trump keeps saying he ll work for all Americans.One of his top advisers, Roger Stone, now, is saying he s proud to walk alongside Trump as a symbol for the Neo-Nazi movement while he s protesting Hillary s  basket of deplorables  comment aimed at half of Trump s followers.The irony is strong in this one.Stone thinks he s going to turn the word  deplorables  around the way that President Obama turned  Obamacare  from something derogatory into something with his signature on it. He will make this backfire on Hillary, because of course. It s his own idea that s backfiring though   all he s done is prove that an awful lot of Trump s supporters are really deplorable people.Image via TwitterPepe the Frog has been around for awhile, to be sure. It recently became unacceptable, however, as the Neo-Nazis began working towards claiming Pepe as a racist, white nationalist symbol.So now Pepe represents what he was always supposed to represent, and he s in a likeness of Donald Trump. Roger Stone has an image co-opted from  The Expendables,  showing Trump as a Neo-Nazi mascot, that he s put on social media.And he s probably amazingly proud of his ingenious idea.This isn t the first time Trump s been depicted as Pepe. In 2015, Trump retweeted a different image of himself as Pepe standing in front of an American flag, and behind a podium. The alt-right worked to associate their mascot with Trump because they believe that Trump represents them. And who wouldn t? The toxic waste fountain on the front of Trump s face spouts everything they want to hear. @codyave: @drudgereport @BreitbartNews @Writeintrump  You Can t Stump the Trump  https://t.co/0xITB7XeJV pic.twitter.com/iF6S05se2w  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2015The sheer hypocrisy involved in promoting Trump as anything dealing with white nationalist groups while whining about Hillary insulting half of Trump s voters is just absurd. White nationalists, who make up an awful lot of the alt-right, are far more hateful and discriminating than Hillary ever could be.The truth is that these are people who think that immigration equals white genocide. Some on the alt-right hate women and everything to do with women. A lot of them think that some races are inherently more stupid than others, and deserve to be treated as such. These are people who are as anti-Semitic as Adolf Hitler.In short, they re deplorable people, and Stone is busy complaining that Hillary called them what they are while directly associating Trump with them. Any reasonable campaign and any reasonable adviser would find a different way to make that backfire on Hillary   the Trump camp is too entrenched with the alt-right and too full of itself to realize what they ve actually done, though.Featured image via screen capture from Roger Stone s tweet",News,"September 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch This Mattress Company’s Impossibly Vile 9/11 Sale Commercial (VIDEO),"Miracle Mattress of San Antonio wants everyone to know that they ll never forget Sept. 11, 2001. To that end, they posted the most amazingly, disgustingly tone-deaf and just plain terrible commercial to commemorate the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. It was cheerful, it talked about the Twin Towers and used them to promote discounts on all their mattresses, and then And then they took it too far. Way too far. So impossibly far that we can t even see it from the boundaries of decency with the Hubble Space Telescope.Because using a national tragedy to promote a sale isn t classless enough.Watch it for yourself (TRIGGER WARNING):It was posted to a parody page aimed at shaming Miracle Mattress up one side and down the other for this, and remains viewable there. It has been removed from social media elsewhere.Miracle Mattress has been shredded to confetti for this, to the point where they ve posted a letter of apology on their main Facebook page, and changed their background image to show part of that letter. That s not enough for some of the people on their page, though. Many of the comments below are from members of the military, people who were in NYC on that horrific day, and even some of the responders.They re rightfully angry and their comments are heart-wrenching. For them, and for anybody with the tiniest micron of a heart, the apology rings hollow and false and just plain isn t enough.         Miracle Mattress  last post on Facebook is a screenshot of a second letter from the owner, Mike Bonnano. The company has closed the doors of their store indefinitely, will remain silent through the 9/11 anniversary, and then will issue a formal statement next week.That will be of major comfort to the people who are pissed off, offended, and hurt by that video, we re sure. This will definitely cost the company business. It might push them out of business, and for a company that s so clueless that the owner didn t know his own daughter made that video, perhaps that s for the best.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"September 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" New Unfiltered Video Shows That Trump Supporters Are, In Fact, F**king Deplorable (VIDEO)","The only mistake Hillary Clinton made when saying half of Trump s supporters are a  basket of deplorables  would be in the fact that the number was too low.

 WATCH: Trump Just Made A Weird Shooting Comment About Clinton,"Donald Trump made an odd statement about Hillary Clinton during a campaign rally in Florida on Friday night. Trump told his supporters that Clinton could shoot somebody and not be prosecuted for the crime. She is being so protected. She could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching right smack in the middle of the heart and she wouldn t be prosecuted,  Trump said.Trump was commenting on the federal government s decision not to prosecute Clinton after she was investigated for using a private email server. Taken on its own, the comment doesn t appear to be too controversial, keeping in mind this is the live action version of Trump speaking at a rally in a conservative state. However, the comment is odd because it is similar to something Trump said about himself back in January during a campaign event in Iowa. I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn t lose any voters, OK?  the pre-nominee Trump told his supporters.The assertion has me wondering, just how well  protected  Trump is. Trump is embroiled in numerous legal scandals, the biggest probably being the huge scam known as Trump University. The university is a scam that took thousands of people s money and gave them nothing back in return. Even former employees of the  school  were revealed to have considered the place to be a giant fraud. Questions have even been raised about whether Trump had actually bribed his way out of having the school be investigated in Florida.I have no idea how Trump is still not in prison for his dealings in Atlantic City. That s where he made millions from casinos that were failing. He also failed to pay contracted workers what they were owed, all the while taking in huge bonuses. Some of his actions might even have been felonious.Say what you want about Clinton and her status in society and you will see Trump standing at least just as high.  Trump is billionaire aristocrat who uses his privilege to grow his fortune even more by abusing the working class. He is protected. He is not an outsider. We live in a capitalist society and he is a member of the transnational capitalist class.You can watch trump make the comment below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"September 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Senate Republicans Diss Trump BADLY–They LOVE Tim Kaine And Aren’t Afraid To Say So,"The GOP has, more or less, gotten into the habit of putting forth lukewarm defenses of Donald Trump and his many ahem problems, or just staying silent altogether. They re more vocal in their opposition to Hillary, however, her running mate, Tim Kaine, has Senate Republicans in an uproar   because they love him and believe they can actually work with him. Kaine is something of a throwback to a chummier era of Senate politics,  says Politico on this story. They mean that his ways of working are a throwback to a time before toxic, extremist Tea Party politics began eating the entire Republican Party from the inside out, like really nasty parasites that eventually kill their hosts. Senate Republicans are hoping that he ll use his relationships and ability to work with them as an asset should Hillary get elected.And their praise is pretty lavish, particularly for the opposing VP candidate at the height of a presidential election cycle. Politico spoke to a dozen GOP Senators about this. Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), who serves with Kaine on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said: He understands the issues, he cares about having an outcome and I think he could be very effective with working with people here. Susan Collins (R-ME), who admittedly can be a bit more moderate than many of her colleagues, said: If we do end up having Hillary as our president   he will be a good influence as far as relationships with Congress   and getting away from the incivility that has marred the past decade. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) has made no secret of the fact that he can t vote for Trump, and he s said he won t vote for Hillary, either. However, he, too, sees Kaine as an asset to Hillary: I don t know anybody on the Republican side who has a bad thing to say about him. He doesn t go out of his way to go after people politically and he s all about policy. Flake also said: I m not going to concede the election. But if he s in that position then Hillary Clinton will be well-served. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) seems to like that Kaine is playing up Democratic policy proposals rather than attacking incumbent Republicans while stumping for them in battleground states: I haven t seen anything yet that he s done [on the campaign trail] that would damage his ability to work with Republicans. And Lindsey Graham (R-SC), said of Kaine awhile back: Tim would be a good steady hand for [Hillary]. He d be well received on our side of the aisle if he s an emissary from the president. Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) both praised his bipartisanism. Hell, even the North Carolina Republican Party gave him an unqualified apology after mistaking a Blue Star Service pin, which he wears to honor his son on active duty, for the flag of Honduras and posting about it on Twitter:There are parts of the GOP that would have just quietly deleted that tweet and hoped the outrage would quickly die, lest they appear to actually (gasp!) respect a Democrat.It will likely be up to the Senate to try to pull the House in line should Hillary get elected. House conservatives, unsatisfied with the previous eleventy thousand investigations against Hillary, are talking about launching another one in a desperate and sorry attempt to find something on her that means they can unequivocally work against her, and thus, America, because reasons.With the strong possibility that Kaine can broker more bipartisan legislation and improve relations between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, though, then there s a slight possibility that the House may eventually fall in line. When the Senate sends bipartisan legislation over to the House that they won t even look at, they look like the sulky, peevish little kids who can t play nice that they are.Kaine could easily be the direct line to Senate Republicans that Hillary needs to actually get stuff done. And Senate Republicans are loving it.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Chris Mathews DESTROYS Trump Surrogate Who Says Clinton Started Birther Movement,"During an interview on MSNBC s Hardball with Chris Mathews on Friday, Trump surrogate Jack Kingston claimed that Hillary Clinton was the person who started the birther movement. Mathews did not hold back when he pressed Kingston on the accusation that is, frankly, as absurd as the claim the birther movement originally put forth.Already sounding a bit peeved at the assertion, Mathews asks Kingston,  Where did you see this? Kingston claims that he saw an inter-party email from 2008 that was put out by the Clinton campaign: From the Clinton campaign itself? You ve seen this? Kingston says that he has seen a copy of the e-mail. No, you can t say Hillary Clinton is the mother of the birther movement and not have evidence,  Mathews says.  You knew you were coming on the show, why didn t you bring it with you? I may even have it my briefcase, Chris I don t know. Mathews tells Kingston that the show is live and they have enough time for him to find it if it is. This is a live show. We ve got an hour. Find it. Congressman, dead serious, if you can find something from the Clinton campaign   not some blogger out there   but somebody who actually worked for Hillary Clinton under her direction who said that the president wasn t born in this country that would be news. If you can produce it Now, of course, Kingston cannot produce any evidence because it is a lie. Should such an e-mail exist, it wouldn t just be news, it would be a bombshell that would severely cripple the Democratic Party. It probably would not convince many Democrats to start buying red hats and voting for Trump, though it would certainly make even her most die-hard supporters cringe.Kingston is merely trying to deflect from the fact that Trump still has not apologized for perpetuating the birther conspiracy theory. The allegations that Trump put forth about President Obama during the early years of Obama s administration were Trump s first foray into the political spotlight. His allegations were what built his base of radical right-wing conservatives. He cannot apologize for fear of alienating that base of supporters.Trump would love for most of the world to forget that he ever was a birther. We won t. It s important. No matter how many surrogates Trump s campaign throws out there to try and change the narrative surrounding the controversy, we won t forget.You can watch the interview below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ISJaqJt_VMFeatured image from video screenshot",News,"September 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Prisoners Are Going On Strike Across The United States To End Legal Slavery,"Yesterday marked the 45th anniversary of the Attica prison uprising. The uprising was the first major prison uprising in the United States. Today, there will be a nation-wide prison strike is a modern day slave rebellion.The IWW Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee put out a call to action, saying: On September 9th of 1971 prisoners took over and shut down Attica, New York State s most notorious prison. On September 9th of 2016, we will begin an action to shut down prisons all across this country. We will not only demand the end to prison slavery, we will end it ourselves by ceasing to be slaves. Work stoppages will occur in prisons across the United States. Organizers on the outside will also be conducting mass demonstrations across the nation.Slavery is legal in the United States of America. That may not be what you were told while growing up but it is completely true and is enshrined in the Constitution. Section 1 of the 13th Amendment states that: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. When the 13th Amendment was ratified, it did not make slavery illegal. It made it illegal for private entities to own slaves. Once an individual is convicted of a crime, they are slaves until their sentence is served. Despite the illegality of private slavery, corporations are making a killing by using publicly owned slaves. Everything from Victoria s Secret lingerie to juice boxes has been manufactured in slave operated factories, that we refer to prisons.There are more people of color in prison today than there were during the days of private slavery. That is a disturbing fact that must be brought up when speaking on the topic of public slavery.People reading this (or who decided to comment on the article without reading it) might say that prisoners are being taught valuable skills that will help them once they are released from prison. That s absolutely correct. That being said, a skilled person with a criminal record is still a person with a criminal record. We brand our slaves in the United States. Those people would also be in good company of those who defended the practice of chattel slavery in the south prior to the emancipation of private slaves.Those who defended private slavery viewed slave masters as the benefactors of privately owned slaves. People of color were considered to be unskilled and unable to provide for themselves adequately on their own.It is now time that people realize that there is a modern-day abolitionist movement growing in the United States. Incarcerated workers must rise up. Those who are not incarcerated must support them. It s time to join the fight and recognize that slavery did not end when the 13th Amendment was ratified, it decided who was eligible to hold slaves in bondage and who isn t.Those who are incarcerated are risking their lives by fighting back against their owners. They may be beaten, tortured, or otherwise penalized for demanding their basic human rights be recognized.Featured image from Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Joy Reid Shuts Down Trump Supporter For Peddling Lie After Lie About Hillary Clinton,"Once again, a mouthpiece for Donald Trump gets their ass handed to them for blatantly lying on the air.During her show on Saturday morning, MSNBC host Joy Reid had to frustratingly correct Trump supporter David Malpass for making false claims about Hillary Clinton.It began with Reid talking about the alleged  pay-to-play  scandal Republicans have been accusing the former Secretary of State of conducting in conjunction with the Clinton Foundation during her years in the post.Reid explained that if Donald Trump gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation which then went to fighting AIDS in Africa, which benefits those who get treatment. Reid pointed out that getting a phone call from Clinton aide Huma Abedin is not proof of pay-to-play.However, Donald Trump giving $25,000 to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi s campaign in exchange for getting the investigation against Trump University dropped in that state is the very definition of pay-to-play.Malpass tried to claim that there were $10 million contributions but when challenged to provide proof of that claim Malpass could not do so. Reid called out Malpass for lying and went on to explain that the Associated Press found that only 85 of the meetings that Clinton had with people who were donors but not one of those meetings occurred after a donation was made.The AP story was  pilloried,  Reid said,  because they attempted to find pay-to-play and found nothing. Huma Abedin emailing you back is not getting something,  Reid continued.  It s Huma Abedin emailing you back. Malpass, however, desperately tried to pin something on Hillary Clinton and brought up her emails, which have nothing to do with the topic at hand. Reid called Malpass out again, but he continued to claim that the emails  brought out the information  about the Clinton Foundation. Malpass also claimed that Hillary Clinton has not held any press conferences but Reid corrected him again by pointing out that she held two last week.As Reid repeatedly shamed Malpass for  conflating press conferences, emails and foundations,  her other guest Kurt Eichenwald broke out in laughter because Malpass was clearly making false claims.By the end of the segment, a frustrated Reid admitted that her head hurts after having to debunk so much bullshit from Trump s minions.Here s the video via YouTube.Trump and his team are desperate to make anything Clinton does into a scandal. And that s why any claims they make that they are somehow winning this election are complete bullshit. A winning campaign does not have to stoop to telling outright lies to the media every day. But that is what Trump is doing because his poll numbers have imploded and his campaign has fallen off a cliff.Republicans have waged countless witch hunts using taxpayer money in an effort to sabotage the woman who stands in their way of absolute power and they have failed miserably because the investigations have always cleared Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing. Rather than admit that, Trump and his minions would rather repeat lies because it s all they have left.Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Gets Humiliated By New York Lawmaker For False 9/11 Claims,"It has been 15 years since the World Trade Center Twin Towers fell. But Republicans and Donald Trump still exploit it for political gain.During Trump s primary run for the Republican nomination, he made a claim that sent journalists into a frenzy of fact-checking. I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,  Trump said during a rally last November.  And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering. Trump doubled down the next day during an interview with George Stephanopoulos. It was on television. I saw it,  Trump said.  It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don t like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good. But what Trump is claiming never happened.After an exhaustive search, Politifact concluded:This defies basic logic. If thousands and thousands of people were celebrating the 9/11 attacks on American soil, many people beyond Trump would remember it. And in the 21st century, there would be video or visual evidence.Instead, all we found were a couple of news articles that described rumors of celebrations that were either debunked or unproven.Trump s recollection of events in New Jersey in the hours after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks flies in the face of all the evidence we could find. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.And on Friday, New York Rep. Gregory Meeks humiliated Trump for that very claim once again during a panel discussion about Trump s birtherism on CNN.Just like Trump won t admit that he is wrong about his birtherism, Trump has also not apologized for being wrong about Muslims cheering in America on 9/11.After Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany claimed that Trump has renounced his birther past, Meeks pointed out that Trump himself should man up and publicly do it himself. Then he should say it. If he believes it, he should say it. There s a pattern with Donald Trump. I m still looking   and I m sure that everybody s still looking   for those  thousands of Muslims  that were cheering during 9/11. That has not taken place. We heard video where he says he was for the war in Iraq. He now says he wasn t. There s not any evidence where he was against the war in Iraq. There is a practice and pattern with Donald Trump, who continues to make noise he knows is completely incorrect,  Meeks continued.  He never apologizes about it. He leaves it out there. Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump is a coward and a liar and he is totally unqualified to be president. The 15th anniversary of 9/11 is on Sunday and you just know that Trump is going to make some outrageous claim in an effort to exploit the tragedy.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Obama Has A Powerful Message About 9/11 You Have To See (VIDEO),"President Obama used the platform of his weekly address from the White House to address the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In his speech, the President sought to remind Americans of their best qualities as we saw in the response to the horrific attack.In his weekly radio and Internet address, Obama said that while so much has changed in the years since 9/11 it s important to remember what has stayed the same.  The core values that define us as Americans. The resilience that sustains us,  he said on the eve of the 15th anniversary of one of the nation s darkest days.He said the terrorists  goal is to frighten Americans into changing how they live, but  Americans will never give in to fear. We re still the America of heroes who ran into harm s way, of ordinary folks who took down the hijackers, of families who turned their pain into hope,  Obama said.The idea that America has to eye all Muslims with suspicion since 9/11 has unfortunately gone from a fringe belief to a central concern of the conservative movement. Current Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has argued that Muslims should be barred from entry to the United States, and has even suggested that they be tracked somehow. He and other Republicans also claim that Muslims aren t helping America in the war against terrorism, but they have laid down their lives right alongside Christian patriots in the last decade and a half.President Obama s message is one of inclusion not exclusion, arguing that the American instinct was seen in its purest form after the attack, when so many were united in a common cause.The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 killed almost 3,000 people in New York City, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania. The assault was executed by the al Qaeda terrorist network and ordered by leader Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was killed in a raid ordered by President Obama and executed by U.S. Navy Seal Team Six on May 2, 2011.Featured image via YouTube",News,"September 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Brands Bigoted Trump Supporters With Brilliant New Moniker In Fiery Speech,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is not mincing words when it comes to the bigotry that runs rampant among Donald Trump supporters. While speaking in New York at a fundrasier focused on LGBTQ issues, Hillary pointed out what we already know: many on the Trump Train are straight up bigots, and there s no way around that fact. She said: You know, just to be grossly generalist, you could put half of Trump s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic   you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. Hillary then went on to make sure that people knew that she understands that not all of Trump s supporters are like this; in fact likely many are disturbed by many of his statements and the behavior of some of their fellow Trump supporters, and they are likely just desperate for change and have been duped into believing Trump can deliver it. She continued: That other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they re just desperate for a change,  she said.  They don t buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different. They won t wake up and see their jobs disappear, lose a kid to heroin, feel like they re in a dead end. Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well. She also added that if you know folks who might vote for Trump, do something about it: If you know anybody who s even thinking of voting for Trump, stage an intervention. Hillary is right, of course. Donald Trump is a demagogue, and this is how demagogues work. They prey on the desperate, they exploit and magnify divisions, all for their own gain of political power. Trump is in no way fit to be president, and his very candidacy is already endangering the country. To that end, we need to listen to Hillary, get out the vote, and make sure she wins, for the future of our own lives and this great nation that we all love.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Gives Insane Warning On Religious Right Network To Scare People Into Voting For Him (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is continuing his campaign of fear-mongering, this time insisting that the 2016 election will be the last actual election unless Americans put him in the White House. Appearing for an interview on the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump told host David Brody that Republicans will never have a chance at the White House again because you re going to have illegal immigrants coming in and they re going to be legalized and they re going to be able to vote and once that all happens you can forget it. So, in other words, Trump is once again blaming immigrants for all of the Republican Party s problems. The thing is, though, the GOP s issues are of their own making. They are on the wrong side of history on issues of race, women s issues, their fervent bigotry against the LGBTQ community, their denial of science, and any other number of issues. In other words, until they stop being the party of bigotry, they will never appeal to anyone but bigots, and there just aren t enough of them left in the general electorate for a majority to want to put an obvious racist in the White House. Here is the transcript of that exchange, via Right Wing Watch:Trump: I think it s going to be the last election that the Republicans can win. If we don t win this election, you ll never see another Republican and you ll have a whole different church structure. You re going to have a whole different Supreme Court structure. That has to do a lot with what we re doing because the Supreme Court, as you know with Justice Scalia gone, I think you could probably have four to five judges picked by the next president. Probably a record number, David, probably a record number of judges. If they pick the super-liberals, probably to a certain extent, people that would make Bernie Sanders happy, you will never have a Supreme Court, we re going to end up with another Venezuela, large scale version. It would be a disaster for the country.Brody: Just so I understand, when you say last election are you referring to what Michele Bachmann was talking about with citizenship because Hillary is talking about potentially providing citizenship for many of these illegals. Florida and Texas could be gone.Trump: I think this will be the last election if I don t win. I think this will be the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning because you re going to have people flowing across the borders, you re going to have illegal immigrants coming in and they re going to be legalized and they re going to be able to vote and once that all happens you can forget it. I guarantee you, you re not going to have one Republican vote. And it s already a very hard number. Already the path is much more difficult for the Republicans. You just have to look at the maps and the path is much more difficult.And here is the video:The thing is, Republicans have no one to thank for the mass defection from their party but themselves. They ve trafficked in hate, conspiracy theories, science denial, and theocratic bigotry for decades. Donald Trump is the natural result of cultivating those sorts of uninformed, ignorant voters   the voters that make up their base that they have to pander to. But, of course, they ll never admit it, and their hateful, archaic party will go into the ash heap of history and into irrelevancy at the national level where it belongs.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"September 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 New Obama Rule Will STOP Republicans From Defunding Planned Parenthood – Forever,"Republicans hate it. They really really hate it, but after more than seven years of trying to work across the aisle, President Obama s administration has given up and is taking matters into its own hands, this time to save Planned Parenthood, forever.The rule, by the Department of Health and Human Services, if enacted, would cut Title X funding to states that cut funding to Planned Parenthood.The Title X program provides basic preventive health care and family planning services for 4 million low-income Americans. About 85 percent of patients who use Title X have incomes below $23,500. Planned Parenthood serves about a third of those patients, using the $70 million a year it receives in Title X grants to subsidize contraceptives and cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings for people who can t afford them. Title X does not allow any money to be used to pay for abortions for any reason.Still, politicians in 11 states have voted to block public funds from Planned Parenthood because its services include abortion. Republicans in Congress are also on a mission to defund the family planning provider, citing a series of debunked undercover videos produced by anti-abortion activists that purport to show Planned Parenthood selling fetal body parts. Source: Huffington PostRepublicans have had Planned Parenthood in their crosshairs for years. Ostensibly it s because Planned Parenthood performs abortions, but only three percent of what they do is about abortions. The rest is about family planning and both women s and men s health services. In other words, Planned Parenthood prevents far more abortions than they could ever perform.Besides, their objection to Planned Parenthood has nothing whatsoever to do with abortion. Republicans consistently cut off funding for Planned Parenthood, despite the fact that no federal money and very little state money goes toward abortions. In other words, it s highly unlikely you ve ever paid a penny in taxes that has gone to abort a fetus.So, what is the problem with Planned Parenthood? Well, the problem is that most Republicans in Congress and in the states believe it s the 18th century and that women should be punished for having sex. Sure, they might agree to Planned Parenthood performing mammograms, but g-d forbid they do anything with lady parts or anything that would imply a woman is having sex without a) being married and b) wanting to procreate.Just this week, Congress blocked funding to fight the Zika virus by you got it sticking an amendment in there that would block funding to Planned Parenthood.Perhaps that was the last straw and that s why the Department of Health and Human Services proposed this new rule.Planned Parenthood is breathing a sigh of relief: This will make a real difference in so many people s lives,  said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood.  Thanks to the Obama administration, women will still be able to access the birth control they need to plan their families, and the cancer screenings they need to stay healthy. That s not the only defeat anti-choice Republicans have faced this week. A judge in very conservative Utah ruled that the state cannot cut funding to Planned Parenthood.Perhaps this is a sign that the pendulum is finally beginning to swing the other direction. Perhaps soon, women will get a say in our own health choices.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,"September 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH This GOP Rep. Angrily Offer A Gift To His Fellow Republicans For Rejecting Zika Funding,"The only time Republicans want to actually help people is when it will help them, too. Rep. David Jolly (R-FL) is well aware of this, and being from Florida, he s understandably angry about the House s refusal to pass funding to combat Zika. So he decided to try and make his obstructive, intransigent colleagues understand the crisis   by threatening to release 100 mosquitoes from Florida onto the House floor.He also berated them for their utter selfishness: I brought these mosquitoes today to convey that fear and that anxiety of millions of Americans, of Floridians. Can you imagine the fear and anxiety in this chamber if these mosquitoes were outside this jar, not inside this jar.Members of Congress would run down the hall to the physician s office to be tested. They would spray themselves before coming down here. This is the fear of Floridians! Right here! The House is interested in defunding Planned Parenthood to the point where they stick that legislation in everything, hoping that putting it in an otherwise must-pass bill will lead to getting rid of the organization altogether. They do this even when doing so is totally irrelevant, and actually damaging, to the very real problems Americans face.Like Zika, in Florida. Watch him go at the rest of the House below:Democrats actually blocked the bill, but they did so because of provisions on Planned Parenthood, the fact that it would rob the ACA of needed funding, and the fact that it was nearly $1 billion less than the Obama administration had requested. Furthermore, the Senate passed a bi-partisan Zika bill of its own that the House wouldn t vote on. Republicans love to play this game so they can blame Democrats for obstruction.The truth is, if they d just pass a clean bill like grown-ups, then we d have a lot more governing and a lot less of this.In fact, Paul Ryan said that when it came time for House and Senate negotiators to act, it was Democrats who refused. He left out one teensy, tiny little detail when he blasted them about it   the fact that Republican negotiators insisted the bill must carry a provision blocking funding for a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico.Since January, Zika has spread to 13 states, likely exists in far more, and is at crisis levels in Florida. 84 pregnant women have been diagnosed with the virus, and there are probably hundreds more who are currently undiagnosed. As of just a few days ago, there were 614 known cases total in Florida. There were 210 known cases in California.With this, one would hope that Republicans could put their politics aside and pass a clean bill to address the crisis, and then go back to playing politics if they must. Vice President Biden actually went straight to Congress to ask them to stop playing games. From Reuters: Give us an up-or-down vote, straight, on Zika,  Biden said at an event on Capitol Hill with fellow Democrats from the Senate and House of Representatives. I understand attaching controversial issues to important legislation   but this is a national emergency,  Biden added.  People s health, the well-being of unborn children, the health of the country at large, is at stake. Act. Republicans don t care, so Jolly decided to try and force them to care by threatening them with Zika to see how they d react. He decided to try and instill the fear that his state feels over the virus. It s unclear if the gambit worked, though. If it doesn t, then the situation is just more proof that the GOP isn t actually pro-life (because if they were, this would have been a done deal long ago), and also that they couldn t give two craps about helping anybody.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"September 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sen. Tim Scott: Running A Small Business Makes Me An Authority On Abortion (VIDEO),"The 2016 Values Voter Summit is underway, and of course this yearly gathering of homophobes, misogynists, science deniers, and other assorted right-wing nuts is especially feverish since this is an election year. At the top of the list of priorities for such people, is, of course, abortion.These people hate the idea of a woman being able to control her own body. They think that a bunch of men in the government should have that authority, not a woman and her doctor. However, one GOP Senator who spoke at this horrible event really had the most absurd argument ever to make the case that he is somehow more qualified than anyone else to legislate on abortion: because he ran a small business before he was a member of Congress.South Carolina Senator Tim Scott said, with the air of a father finding out that his teen daughter has come home pregnant, that an employee told him that she was pregnant. So what did Sen. Scott do with this woman? Why, what any manipulative Christian who wants to control the lives of others would do: took her to a crisis pregnancy center.Crisis pregnancy centers are nothing but right-wing Christian organizations that lie about a woman s choices when it comes to dealing with an unwanted pregnancy. They manipulate young girls and women into believing that abortion is absolutely not an option, for any reason. And, of course, these are the same people who are opposed to any sorts of help for the mothers and children once they are born.Senator Scott said of the conclusion of his decision to  help  this woman in this way, and how it makes him especially qualified to opine and legislate on this matter: As an elected official, when I have the responsibility and the opportunity, the privilege to protect life, I do so having been in the private sector, realizing the importance that we should place on life and the choice of life. Senator Scott, you aren t  protecting  anything. You re just trying to control the bodies of women around the nation who you don t even know. Plus, you ll likely, like all GOPers, abandon these fetuses the second they are out of the womb. You people and your sick obsession with controlling women need to be voted out. As a South Carolinian, I plan to do just that.Watch Tim Scott s crazy unfold below:Featured image via Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images",News,"September 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Greta Van Susteren Slams Fox News For Not Dealing With Roger Ailes Sooner,"Fox News is collapsing like a house of cards as the fallout over rampant sexual harassment continues.Gretchen Carlson got the ball rolling when she filed a lawsuit against the conservative network, accusing Fox boss Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her and punishing her for refusing to have sex with him.Rather than stand by their colleague, however, Fox hosts such as Greta Van Susteren and others took Ailes  side instead.But now that Carlson has been vindicated and Ailes forced to resign, Van Susteren now regrets not believing the victim in the first place.In a post on Facebook on Friday, Van Susteren opened up about Carlson and expressed regret for not believing Carlson from the start. I read Geraldo s FB post in which he said he regretted not believing Gretchen Carlson s claim of sexual harassment,  she wrote.  We all regret it   I made my regret self evident in my GretaWire posting about 3 weeks ago which ended with this:  Gretchen, you go girl.  That said it all. Van Susteren continued by admitting that it was unfair for her to judge the case since she was 200 miles away from where the harassment took place and that she had never talked to Carlson about it to hear her side of the story personally. It is indeed true, when I read the complaint written by lawyers   I never spoke to Gretchen as she was long gone from Fox   I found it inconsistent with what was my experience and information at the Fox News Channel, admittedly working 200 miles from the  scene of the crimes.  It was hidden from all of us. Van Susteren left Fox News earlier this week and they replaced her with Brit Hume, a man who has spewed sexist remarks on the air for years.And now that she is no longer employed by Fox News, Van Susteren has absolutely no problem shaming her former employers for not doing anything about Roger Ailes sooner. But I have regrets beyond Geraldo s and beyond not believing a civil complaint written by lawyers. I regret that Roger Ailes was not supervised by those in a public corporation who had the duty to supervise him. This included his seniors, the CFO s of both Fox News Channel and 21CF (and its predecessor NewsCorp), the Board of Directors and what I assume this public corporation had, outside auditors. Checks written that were suspicious should have been spotted. But Fox News still hasn t learned much since many of the people who let Ailes get away with sexually harassing female employees, like Bill Shine, are still employed in their positions by the company.Even some high profile male hosts are still employed, including Steve Doocy, who was named in Carlson s lawsuit, and Bill O Reilly, who was named in Andrea Tantaros  lawsuit.Fox News needs to go beyond axing Ailes. They need to clean house or the working environment at Fox will simply continue being  like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny.

" Donald Trump Just ‘Accidentally’ Did An Interview On Russian TV, Because Of Course He Did (VIDEO)","Donald Trump did an interview with Larry King for his program on Russia Today, a Russian network that specializes in Putin s propaganda. Naturally, Trump says it was an  accident.  He didn t really mean to go on Russian TV. Obviously, King tricked him into it! What other explanation could there be?A trump spokeswoman told Kevin Cirilli from Bloomberg News that Trump was doing King a favor because they are old friends and The Donald is such a benevolent soul. Naturally, when King asked him to do the interview, the GOP nominee assumed that he meant for his podcast. (I guess he never heard that phrase about assuming.) So it was totally not his fault that he ended up doing the interview for King s show on Russian Television.Trump campaign spokeswoman tells me that Trump ""recorded a short interview with Larry King for his podcast as a favor to Mr. King.""  Kevin Cirilli (@kevcirilli) September 9, 2016Trump campaign spokeswoman says that they thought Larry King interview was going to be on King's podcast   not RT.  Kevin Cirilli (@kevcirilli) September 9, 2016Trump campaign spokeswoman tells me that ""what Larry King does with the interview content is up to him, we have nothing to do with it.""  Kevin Cirilli (@kevcirilli) September 9, 2016Jason Miller, another Trump spokesman, gave the same story and claimed that Trump thought he was being interviewed for King s CNN podcast. Mr. Trump was never told it would be shared anywhere else,  Miller said.Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway jumped on the bandwagon during a Friday morning appearance on CNN s New Day, saying that Trump never realized he as being interviewed for the Russian network. A former CNN superstar, Larry King, has a podcast, and Mr. Trump went on his podcast. Nobody said it would be on Russian TV,  Conway insisted.Trump has sung the praises of Russian President Vladimir Putin throughout the election and earlier in the week even said that Putin is a better president than Obama during the Command-in-Chief Forum.During the phone interview, King asked Trump what he thought about recent reports that, following the DNC hack, American officials are looking into allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. I think it s probably unlikely. Maybe the Democrats are putting that out   who knows,  Trump replied.  If they are doing something, I hope that somebody s going to be able to find out so they can end it. Because that would not be appropriate at all.

 WATCH: Guiliani Claims Trump Gave Up Birtherism And Chris Matthews WRECKS Him,"MSNBC host asked one final question during an interview with Rudy Guiliani on Thursday and his answer caused Matthews to take the former mayor to the woodshed.For years, Donald Trump has been outright accusing President Obama of not being born in the United States. Then President Obama released his birth certificate to the public and thoroughly humiliated the businessman.And now that Trump is the Republican nominee, his birtherism is coming back to bit him in the ass as he has repeatedly been asked if he still believes President Obama was born in Kenya.So far, Trump has refused to talk about it and is hoping the media will just forget about the whole thing, but Chris Matthews had other ideas on Thursday as he cornered Rudy Guiliani about it.Matthews pointed out that Mike Pence and Ben Carson have both broken with Donald Trump to confirm that President Obama is the legitimately elected Commander-in-Chief of the United States.Guiliani claimed that he also believes that and said that Donald Trump believes that as well, but Matthews didn t buy it because Trump has avoided talking about it and has not publicly admitted that President Obama was born in America. When did he do that?  Matthews demanded to know.Guiliani claimed Trump said it a few years ago, but that was news to Matthews, who continued to grill Guiliani about it.Guiliani then tried to blame Hillary Clinton for the birther movement, but Matthews quickly shut that lie down and made Guiliani squirm. When is he gonna say that this president is legitimate?  Matthews repeated.  This is a fundamental question, mister mayor. Is the President of the United States legitimate of not? Guiliani continued to try and cover Trump s ass, but Matthews was not having any of it. Can you commit to your candidate saying in the next 24 hours that President Barack Obama s a legitimate president?  Matthews asked.  Can you commit for him that he will say that? But Guiliani couldn t even do that and ended up desperately trying to change the subject to Hillary Clinton.Here s the video via YouTube:Guiliani got his ass handed to him in this interview and that makes it very clear that Donald Trump needs to eat some crow and admit that President Obama is a legitimate president and reject birtherism once and for all.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"September 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Youth Pastor Rapes Teen Girl And Church Demands She Apologize To Her Rapist’s Wife,"This church in Ohio apparently doesn t understand who the victim is here.Columbia Road Baptist Church in North Olmsted actually banned a teenage girl and her family from attending services until she apologizes to the wife of the man who sexually abused her.Youth pastor Brian Mitchell had a wife and three kids, but that didn t stop him from targeting a 16-year-old girl who was simply seeking spiritual guidance at the church.Mitchell began by texting the girl constantly and complained about his wife. The text messages stopped temporarily after church leaders found out about the texts. But since church officials neglected to report Mitchell to the police he pretty much figured he could do whatever he wanted so he moved on to forcibly kissing the underage girl. Then he began sexually abusing her while driving her home.The sexual abuse would continue for the next month and the girl became depressed.Finally, Mitchell was arrested and sentenced to serve ten years in prison after Judge Patrick Corrigan refused to buy his excuse that he loved the girl. Your delusional excuse   that there were emotions and love involved   is troubling,  the judge said.  That s extremely delusional. What s also delusional is that the Columbia Road Baptist Church actually thinks the teenage girl their employee raped somehow owes Mitchell s wife an apology.During testimony, the girl s mother revealed that the church basically blamed her daughter for the whole situation and told them not to come back to the church until an apology has been made. Rather than comply with the ridiculous demand, the family just stopped attending church altogether.Rather than rally around the victim in her time of need, the church instead chose to rally around the rapist. You know, because Jesus.Frankly, the church should be slapped with a lawsuit for not reporting Mitchell s harassment of the teen in the first place. Church leaders knew Mitchell was obsessively texting this girl and they basically did nothing which only emboldened him to go further.Mitchell should not be the only one held responsible for how this girl was treated. Church leaders should be punished as well. And any congregant who actually believes the church was right to demand an apology from the victim is no true Christian. They are as fraudulent as the church they attend.Featured Image: Columbia Road Baptist Church Facebook Page ",News,"September 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Melania Trump Gone AWOL: Trump Campaign Totally Hiding Nominee’s Wife,"If you ve recently noticed that you haven t seen Melania Trump recently, it s not just you. For the last seven weeks since the Republican Convention, the wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has barely been in the public eye.This close to election day, it is very unusual for the spouse of a candidate to be this hidden. Even accounting for the fact that the very visible Bill Clinton is a former president and therefore more accustomed to the campaign trail, Mrs. Trump s disappearance is connected to the Trump campaign s ongoing incompetence. From The Washington Post:Her long silence followed the fiasco over her convention speech, parts of which turned out to have been plagiarized. Then she took her website down after revelations that there was no record she had obtained a college degree, as her site had claimed. And while the issue of illegal immigration is central to her husband s platform, neither Melania Trump nor the Trump campaign has produced documentation to prove how the Slovenian immigrant got a visa to work in the United States or how she obtained her green card in 2001. Melania Trump has said she has been  at all times in full compliance  with immigration laws; Donald Trump has said his wife is  so documented. Even as the campaign declines to fill in details of her life story, Melania Trump has deployed an attorney to beat back news reports probing her past. Last week, the former fashion model filed a libel suit against a blogger and a British newspaper for reports, since retracted, suggesting that she once worked as an escort.It s hard to blame candidate spouses for their desire to avoid the spotlight; after all they aren t the ones running for office. But at the same time, the multiple screw-ups around the Trumps don t seem to be her fault personally. Instead, they are the product of the yes men (and women) that Donald Trump has continuously surrounded himself with, people that are incapable of crafting a convention speech or truthfully writing up a biography on a website.At this point, with the number of questions swirling around Melania Trump, her absence from the campaign trail and inaccessibility to reporters will only make said questions continue to dog her even after this fiasco is long over. However, Trump s incompetency and unwillingness to listen to anyone who might actually be able to clean this sort of thing up neatly means that anyone who might try to help Melania Trump at her husband s request will likely only make matters worse. Poor Melania. She didn t ask for any of this.She s probably better off avoiding these people   and her husband s campaign   at all costs.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Supporter Goes Off The Rails: ‘Hillary’s Place Is In Front Of A Firing Squad’ (VIDEO),"Trump supporter, anti-Islam  activist,  and vapid, racist fool James Stachowiak is furious. Now, Stachowiak is almost perpetually enraged, but this time Shark Tank host Mark Cuban made Johnny Infidel  (as the Tea Partier calls himself) furious. Recently, Cuban predicted that a Trump presidency would create a dire economic downturn.Stachowiak complained that he saw Cuban make the remarks on Fox News. He says that he has no doubt the market will tank if Trump wins the presidency,  the right-wing  activist  whines.  Well, just like every coin has two sides, I m gonna give the other side of the coin. I have no doubt that if Hillary wins, Americans will die because Americans died, Hillary lied, and Benghazi still matters,  he rambles, adding that a Clinton presidency will lead to  more Americans brutally sodomized, murdered, their bodies burned and dragged through the streets of more capitols across the globe like what happened in Benghazi. Boy, what a persuasive argument!Stachowiak then compares Hillary Clinton to the Soviet spies, the Rosenbergs, who were executed for treason because they actually committed treason   unlike Clinton, who has not committed a single prosecutable offense. What Hillary has done makes the Rosenbergs  actions pale in comparison,  he explains.  Hillary s actions have actually caused Americans to die. Benghazi.  Then things get crazy(ier): It is my opinion, and I m probably one of the first to say it, that Hillary Clinton should be put on trial   hopefully under a Trump presidency   and found guilty of treason for compromising national security. She should be sentenced to death at a federal court. Hillary clinton s proper place in our country is in front of a firing squad for committing treason against our country. What should happen to Mark Cuban?  Stachowiak asks rhetorically before burning a photograph of the Clinton supporter.Yeah, that s what he thinks should happen to Mark Cuban. Let s hope none of his insane fans act on it.Featured image via screengrab",News,"September 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" This Bank Ripped Us Off In a HUGE Way, Now Obama Is Making Them Pay Millions For It","If you listen to conservatives, big money interests like the banks have been unfairly attacked by progressives like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. According to them, the system isn t rigged and progressives are just being conspiracy theorists.But now a massive plot inside one of America s biggest banks has been exposed, and the Obama administration is going to make them pay for what they ve done.5,300 Wells Fargo employees are going to be fired, after it was exposed that they have been secretly signing up thousands of customers for accounts they didn t ask for. They did it so they could collect fees and add to their earnings. From CNN Money:The phony accounts earned the bank unwarranted fees and allowed Wells Fargo employees to boost their sales figures and make more money. Wells Fargo employees secretly opened unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses,  Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said in a statement.Now, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a government agency created by President Obama and in part credited to Senator Warren, is stepping in to make the bank pay. Wells Fargo will have to pay full restitution to the victims of its greed, including annual fees, interest charges, and overdraft-protection fees that it deceitfully collected.The bank has entered into an agreement with CFPB to pay $185 million in fines, and $5 million in a refund to its customers.It s worth remembering that Republicans   backed by donations from the banking and financial industry   have tried repeatedly to attack and defund CFPB. Despite the agency being solely dedicated to consumer rights (as opposed to industry concerns, as in other government departments like the notoriously pro-industry Department of Interior), the supposedly populist right has still opposed it.To his credit, not only has Obama defended CFPB, he has argued again and again that Congress should fund it and allow it to stand up for consumers.Featured image via YouTube",News,"September 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" In Brilliant Op-Ed, Hillary Clinton Opens Up About Her Flaws","Hillary Clinton is far from the perfect politician. She sometimes comes across as cold, as unemotional. She, unlike her opponent, though, is perfectly aware of her flaws and in a deeply moving op-ed in the Humans of New York blog, Clinton opens up about her flaws and about being a woman in what s still a man s world.If anyone is demonstrating the double standard between women and men, it s Clinton s opponent, Donald Trump, who just this week said that Clinton doesn t have  a presidential look.  Yeah, we know what that means. Or how about the people who are criticizing Clinton for not smiling enough? Could you imagine that happening with a man?By this time, Clinton is used to the double standard, but it does make it tougher for the most qualified presidential candidate in decades to compete. In the article in Humans of New York, Clinton talked about her history and about how hard she works at not appearing too feminine.She relayed a story about law school, and how hard she worked to learn to control her emotions. She also recognizes that she comes across as cold and unemotional because of that. I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions. And that s a hard path to walk. Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don t want to seem  walled off.  And sometimes I think I come across more in the  walled off  arena. And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility. I don t view myself as cold or unemotional. And neither do my friends. And neither does my family. But if that sometimes is the perception I create, then I can t blame people for thinking that. As for the inevitable comparisons with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, well, she knows she doesn t have their charisma. She also sees how hard they work on it. I m not Barack Obama. I m not Bill Clinton. Both of them carry themselves with a naturalness that is very appealing to audiences. But I m married to one and I ve worked for the other, so I know how hard they work at being natural. It s not something they just dial in. They work and they practice what they re going to say. It s not that they re trying to be somebody else. But it s hard work to present yourself in the best possible way. She also notes that there are very few role models for women in politics and that Obama s and her husband s type of charisma doesn t work for women.It s a double-edged sword. Clinton is accused of being stiff, but if she s animated, things get even worse. But I ve learned that I can t be quite so passionate in my presentation. I love to wave my arms, but apparently that s a little bit scary to people. And I can t yell too much. It comes across as  too loud  or  too shrill  or  too this  or  too that.  Which is funny, because I m always convinced that the people in the front row are loving it. If Clinton wins, some of these double standards might start drifting away, but it s still a misogynistic world. A woman president won t solve misogyny any more than an African-American president solved racism. It s a societal problem, but for those who don t consider themselves sexist, perhaps it s time to take a good hard look at your criticisms of Clinton. Would the criticisms be the same if she was a man?Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Entire Seattle Seahawks Team Will Join Kaepernick In Protest During National Anthem On Sunday,"The Seattle Seahawks will become the first team to join 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in protesting during the National Anthem.According to starting linebacker Bobby Wagner, the team has a  big surprise  in store for the opening game of the season when the Star Spangled Banner is sung. Wagner said that the entire team will be taking part, but he did not say if the players plan to sit or kneel. Anything we want to do, it s not going to be individual. It s going to be a team thing. That s what the world needs to see. The world needs to see people coming together versus being individuals,  Wagner said.Last Thursday, Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane became one of the first two players to join Kaepernick when he sat on the sidelines during the National Anthem. He was supported by head coach Pete Carroll, who recently stood up for Lane when the inevitable criticism came following last week s game. [Lane] s pretty clear on what he did and what he was trying to express and I think it is very simple and so we ll leave that up to him,  Carroll said of Lane s decision to protest.Starting wide receiver Doug Baldwin also expressed his support for Kaepernick and his protest via social media. Baldwin defended Kaepernick s protest when he faced harsh criticism for his decision to sit, and later kneel in honor of the military, during the National Anthem. Baldwin blasted those condemning the 49ers quarterback and reminded them what free speech actually means.We honor those who fight for our right to freedom of speech and then condemn those who exercise that right?  Doug Baldwin Jr (@DougBaldwinJr) September 2, 2016Don t tell me you just disagree with the methods. You really mean to say you disagree with the cause.  Doug Baldwin Jr (@DougBaldwinJr) September 2, 2016To change the status quo you have to upset the status quo. Not by going with the flow.You have to stand/sit for what you believe in.  Doug Baldwin Jr (@DougBaldwinJr) September 2, 2016Kaepernick was joined in kneeling on the sidelines during the anthem last week by fellow 49er Eric Reid. U.S. Women s National Team soccer player Megan Rapinoe, and several members of the West Virginia Tech volleyball team have also chosen to sit or kneel rather than stand during the Star Spangled Banner, to show their solidarity with Kaepernick and the issues he is trying to bring attention to.Kaepernick has said that he is  not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.  Speaking of the police brutality epidemic plaguing America, Kaepernick added that,  There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.

 Mexico Retaliates Against Trump’s Bullying By Threatening To Nullify Treaty That Ended Mexican-American War,"The last thing this country needs right now is a president who will only cause tensions between our allies and ourselves. Mexico is getting sick and tired of being bullied by Donald Trump so they are doing something about it.Trump has threatened to punish Mexico economically is they do not pay for his wall along the border and he has promised to nullify treaties such as NAFTA that promote free trade between Canada, Mexico, and the United States.And now, in the wake of Trump s recent embarrassing trip to Mexico, our southern neighbor is weighing legislation that would possibly nullify the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican-American War and gave the United States the territories of Texas and California in addition to areas of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming.To put it bluntly, Mexico is essentially telling Trump to go f*ck himself. Mexico could also nullify any other treaty or agreement that the two nations have ever made with each other.Introduced by Mexican Senator Armando Rios Piter, the bill would not only cancel the treaty, it would also ban state funds from being used to pay for future Trump visits to the country and from being used to pay for the wall.Furthermore, if Trump retaliates against Mexicans living in the United States, Mexico will respond by placing additional taxes upon the one million Americans who currently live in Mexico. It was a historic error for our president to invite a person like that to our country,  Piter said.  Mr. Trump used us as a campaign tool. The goal is to foresee and prevent any negative effects on Mexico if Trump becomes president of the United States. As a Mexican, I already feel attacked and outraged at Trump. That s why we have to act. We can t take a partisan view of this. All parties in the senate are in agreement that Mexico needs to stand up for itself and strengthen its relationship with the United States. We want to shut Trump s mouth, which has been spewing this hateful speech. This is the kind of diplomatic disaster that electing Donald Trump would cause. It would be a humiliating moment in American history and would signal to the rest of the world that they can also nullify treaties with us. This would be devastating to our leadership role in the world and would make us the laughingstock of the international community. Hundreds of years worth of treaties with countries all around the world would be in jeopardy of being trashed simply because Donald Trump is incapable of not insulting and bullying others. He is the most significant threat facing our country and the rest of the world today and the only way to put that threat down is to make sure he never becomes president.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Intelligence Officials SKEWER Trump For Politicizing Classified Briefings,"The latest 2016 developments are completely unprecedented in our nation s history but Donald Trump doesn t care.Despite the fact that classified intelligence briefings are supposed to be kept confidential and neutral during elections, the Republican nominee broke established protocol on Wednesday night and opened his big mouth to make unfounded claims about those meetings.During the Commander-in-Chief Forum on NBC, Trump demonstrated in a single breath that he is totally unfit to be president when he told Matt Lauer that he could tell by the  body language  of those briefing him that don t like President Obama. I was very, very surprised. In almost every instance, and I could tell, I have pretty good with the body language [sic], I could tell, they were not happy. Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending. Not only is Trump trying to destroy the neutrality of the intelligence community, he is trying to use them for his own political gain.And intelligence officials both past and present were quick to slam him for it.Former CIA analyst Paul Pillar told the Washington Post that intelligence officers do not express political preferences during these briefings and they certainly do not use body language. Those selected for this task would have been the most professional of an elite corps of intelligence officers. One of the last things they would do is express either verbally or through body language preferences. Former CIA officer David Priess, who is experienced at delivering briefings was completely disgusting by Trump s claim. We ve had other presidential candidates mention that they got a briefing and talk in platitudes about it. We ve never had somebody talk about what happened in a session. Trump not only blabbed, he told a straight-up lie in order to claim that there is discord between the Obama Administration and the intelligence community, which could create a mistrust that could have serious consequences. In short, this attempt by Trump to score political points is dangerous.Former CIA Director Michael Morell agrees. This is the first time that I can remember a candidate for president doing a readout from an intelligence briefing, and it s the first time a candidate has politicized their intelligence briefing,  he told NBC.  Both of those are highly inappropriate and crossed a long standing red line respected by both parties. To me this is just the most recent example that underscores that this guy is unfit to be commander in chief. Donald Trump is clearly sowing discord between the intelligence community and the current administration at a time when we need both to work together to protect the American people. But that will only get harder because of Trump s unwillingness to keep his mouth shut by making claims he can t prove.Intelligence officials are trained to be neutral and to keep their personal political beliefs out of their assessments. Ultimately, the president has the final say on what action to take on certain intelligence whether intelligence agents agree or not.At this point, Trump has failed to build trust with the intelligence community and that could be a major problem for this country as we seek to prevent future attacks by ISIS. Donald trump is not helping, he is hurting and that is not the kind of president America needs.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Joy Behar Just SHREDDED Trump After He Praised Putin And Slammed Obama (VIDEO),"While most of the press is content in letting Donald Trump get away with the horrible things he says and won t hold his feet to the fire, at least one person isn t holding back   Joy Behar of The View.After Trump told Matt Lauer during NBC s Presidential Forum that he s happy to be praised by Russia s Vladimir Putin, all the while putting down President Obama, Joy Behar was ready to tear him a new one.Trump even went so far to say that Putin has been a leader  far more  than President Obama has. Keep in mind, Putin cares nothing about the human rights of many of his citizens, most especially gay individuals.And the only reason Putin has been praising Trump is because he knows that if Trump were in power it would be easier for him to power-grab. Putin seems to see Trump as the weaker candidate who will be easier to manipulate due to his lack of experience.Behar started by saying: He forgets that we have checks and balances in this country. We have a constitution. The Russians don t have such a thing. Then, after Candace Cameron Bure tried to spew some nonsense saying Putin makes Russians feel safe, Behar really let Trump have it. She said: The polls in Russia. Is he talking about Polish people? Or is he talking about polls? Because the dictatorship that is Putin is controlling the polls, okay? Then after it was explained that the media doesn t even have representation in Russia, which honestly seems like something Trump would like, Behar said: It s so unpatriotic, is what it is. And for him to say such things, in front of our military, is a disgrace. Which is exactly what it is, and yet another reason Trump shouldn t be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office.Watch Joy Behar tear Trump a new one here:.@joyvbehar on Trump saying Putin is a better leader than Obama:  to say such things   is a disgrace.  https://t.co/MRUf4SsyyN  The View (@TheView) September 8, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Loving Nut-Job Facing Charges After Making Death Threats For This Absurd Reason,"Jason Kauti, an avid supporter of Donald Trump, is facing felony charges in Georgia after he freaked out and started making death threats when a woman online called the GOP nominee  racist.  (Just for the record, he is. But I digress.)A woman, whose name is being withheld at her request, made the fateful mistake of commenting on a friend s political Facebook post. (We ve all been there.) However, when she commented that Trump is a racist, all hell broke lose. Things quickly spiraled out of control when Kauti threatened to murder the woman and her family. If we ever cross paths I will kill you and your family,  Kauti wrote on Facebook.The woman filed a complaint on July 23, seeking help from authorities after her life and the safety of her family was threatened online. Milton police spokesman Lt. Charles Barstow said that Kauti was arrested after posting his death threat on the social media site. They were having an argument and unfortunately the dialogue turned into threats, some very serious threats,  Barstow said.The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that  as recently as Tuesday, public posts on Kauti s Facebook timeline show him holding a handgun with an expletive comment  suck it  under a profile picture of the University of Miami Hurricanes football logo.  That post seems to have been removed, or at least, it is no longer public.When speaking with police, the woman said that Kauti had claimed online to have been in the Class of 1997 at Milton High School. She also provided authorities with a screenshot of the post, but they had to verify that  what we see online is exactly as it is  before they were able to take any action.Kauti has had quite the exciting summer it seems. On July 24, a day after the woman filed her complaint, Kauti was booked into the Fulton County Jail on charges of felony terroristic threat making, erratic lane change and driving under the influence of alcohol. He spent two days behind bars before he was released on a $2,600 bond.A month later, Kauti was sitting in the slammer once again, this time for his homicidal Facebook threats.Fulton County Jail spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan said that although the arrest on July 24 arrest came a day after the woman filed her complaint, the warrant for Kauti s arrest wasn t signed until a month later on August 24. So it would seem that Kauti turned himself in to be processed for the new charge,  Flanagan explained.Kauti was released on August 26 after paying the Alpha Bonding Company for a $7,500 bond. He is scheduled to appear for a preliminary hearing on Friday.You can watch more here.Featured image via AJC.com",News,"September 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Just Got A BIG ‘F*** You’ From Goldman Sachs (TWEETS),"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has just sent the Trump campaign a message that is going to make them furious, especially coming from one of the largest investment banks in the country.Recently, the bank banned all of its top officials from donating to Trump s campaign   which is kind of hilarious considering how much Trump s campaign is struggling. In a memo right now, the bank instructed its highest ranking employees: Effective Thursday, September 1, all partners across the firm are considered  restricted persons  as defined by the firm s Policy on Personal Political Activities in the US. As outlined below, restricted persons are prohibited from engaging in political activities and/or making campaign contributions to candidates running for state and local offices, as well as sitting state and local officials running for federal office.The policy change is meant to prevent inadvertently violating pay-to-play rules, particularly the look-back provision, when partners transition into roles covered by these rules. The penalties for failing to comply with these rules can be severe and include fines and a ban on the firm from doing business with government clients in a particular jurisdiction for a period of at least two years.The policy change is also meant to minimize potential reputational damage caused by any false perception that the firm is attempting to circumvent pay-to-play rules, particularly given partners  seniority and visibility. All failures to pre-clear political activities as outlined below are taken seriously and violations may result in disciplinary action. Damn! And to make this even more brilliant, Goldman Sachs SPECIFICALLY called out the Trump campaign when they described the types of donations that are banned: any federal candidate who is a sitting state or local official (e.g., governor running for president or vice president, such as the Trump/Pence ticket, or mayor running for Congress), including their Political Action Committees (PACs). TwitterTwitterThe interesting thing here is that both Trump and Clinton s running mates hold a position in a political office   yet only Trump s VP pick, Indiana governor Mike Pence, is mentioned. To make matters even worse, these rules don t restrict donations to Clinton s campaign because Kaine is a U.S. Senator for Virginia and not considered a local official according to Goldman Sachs  rules (although the memo does say employees cannot donate to the Virginia Democratic party).Although Goldman Sachs  CEO hasn t officially said who he is voting for, it s public knowledge that he s a long-time Clinton fan, and had donated to her campaign when she ran against Obama in 2008.You can read the full memo here, as obtained by Fortune.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Clinton Gives The Perfect Response To Reince Priebus’ Sexist Tweet,"After GOP candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton wrapped up their appearance on MSNBC s  Commander In Chief  forum, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, had some very sexist words for Clinton:@HillaryClinton was angry + defensive the entire time   no smile and uncomfortable   upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets.  Reince Priebus (@Reince) September 8, 2016The old  she needs to smile more  and  she s too emotional  spiel. Of course, Trump was also defensive (even belittling a female veteran), but you heard nothing from Priebus about it. No, in typical Republican form, the old, angry conservative man decided to attack the qualified woman running because that s just what they do. Naturally, social media tore him to shreds for being a gross misogynist. But it was Hillary Clinton s response, always laced with class and elegance, that took the cake: Actually, that s just what taking the office of President seriously looks like. https://t.co/Pyn92mesom  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 8, 2016And that s how it s done.While the good ol  boys let Trump have a free pass on everything (Matt Lauer has been eviscerated for his handling of the forum), it s Hillary who is blasted, not because of policy disagreements, but because of demeanor, something that would never be said to any man running for the office of presidency.So Trump can praise Putin, blast our generals (and hint at firing them en masse), but god forbid Hillary Clinton takes this forum serious and doesn t smile enough. Thanks for showing the American people where your priorities lie, Republicans. I wonder, will smiling more will keep our troops safe, reward our veterans, avoid war/conflict, and clean up the DOD budget?So the media and the GOP elite focus on smiling, coughing, a pillow on the chair during interviews, and defensive strategy. No wonder Trump is a nominee for President of the United States.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Gave The Most BIZARRE Response For How He’ll Defeat ISIS (VIDEO),"Audience members and viewers watching MSNBC s  Commander-in-Chief Forum  were treated to a rare, once-in-a-lifetime moment last night when Donald Trump actually told the truth for a few seconds about his  plan  to defeat ISIS.Host and moderator Matt Lauer had been grilling the Republican nominee on the insanity he s been spewing about having a secret plan to defeat ISIS that he can t reveal (supposedly because it would just tip-off the terrorist group). While Trump has previously been quick to find creative ways to dodge or turn around questions in a way that confuses people and avoids having to actually provide an answer, The Donald slipped up this time. By complete accident, Trump revealed that regardless of what he s said in the past, there is no plan at all.In trying to clarify a contradictory statement that Trump had made in a speech earlier that day in which Trump had said he d give military leaders 30 days to devise a plan to defeat ISIS, Lauer asked Trump: So, is the plan you ve been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan? Trump stumbled over this question right away, unintentionally showing Americans that Trump has yet to come up with a strategy: No. But when I do come up with a plan that I like, and that perhaps agrees with mine   or maybe doesn t   I may love what the generals come back with Lauer continued to question Trump about releasing the plan, and criticized him for taking a plan from  generals    even though Trump has previously said that he knows more about ISIS than they do. This part of the interview was completely bizarre as Trump loses his footing and Lauer knew the Republican nominee was vulnerable   but it was perfect. Trump was finally being exposed for the liar he is.You can watch this part of the interview below:Is Donald Trump s counterterrorism plan to ask for someone else s plan? #NBCNewsForumhttps://t.co/A5IN7J9S9l  MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 8, 2016Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Gary Johnson Displays Stunning Foreign Policy Ignorance On ‘Morning Joe’ (VIDEO),"Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson has been seen as an alternative to Donald Trump for many Republicans and other right-leaning types who can t stomach their own party s nominee and don t want to vote for Hillary Clinton. However, that prospect likely just went right out the window for many people after a Thursday morning question that revealed Johnson s ignorance when it comes to foreign policy.Johnson appeared on MSNBC s Morning Joe, and when asked about what he would do about Aleppo, he actually asked,  What is Aleppo? Veteran columnist and frequent Morning Joe panelist Mike Barnacle looked at Johnson with the rest of the panel, visibly stunned. He responded,  You re kidding.  Johnson said, with a blank stare,  No. In case anyone here is as clueless as Gary Johnson is on this matter, Aleppo is the largest city in Syria, and the heart of the refugee crisis. It s the source of all of those heartbreaking images of children of war that have been ripping all of our hearts out. It s where the battle for Syria is being waged. It s essentially the epicenter of the war that ISIS is waging. To have a person who wishes to be President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of our military not know these basic facts is not only breathtaking in its ignorance, but also disqualifying.In other words, just like Donald Trump, Gary Johnson is far too ignorant of world affairs to be considered for the position he seeks. Out of the viable candidates for the White House, the only person who has the knowledge of world affairs and policy issues to actually be able to effectively do the job is Hillary Clinton. Whatever one might think of her as a person, or of her policy positions, she is qualified. No one else presented to us is.Watch the exchange with Johnson below:.@mikebarnicle: What would you do, if you were elected, about Aleppo? @GovGaryJohnson: And what is Aleppo? https://t.co/ZbqO5RAEsk  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) September 8, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Fox News Steals Greta Van Susteren’s Personal Website, So She Punks Them Hard For It","Greta van Susteren left Fox News abruptly recently, but she s having a bit of fun trolling the network. When someone leaves, standard procedure is to redirect their news page back to Fox s own website. However, they also redirected her personal page, Greta.com. That s not right   she owns the domain. So she took matters into her own hands and redirected it somewhere else.She redirected it to an animal rescue site called PetsConnect Rescue. PetsConnect noticed that, and was so grateful for it that they even tweeted a thank-you at her. Since Fox is right-leaning, and also named after an animal (unless it was named for men s views of women as eye candy), that s punking a little hard. Animal rights and welfare do not matter to the right at all.Not only that, but on the chance that Fox stole her domain to needle her, and it wasn t an honest mistake, needling them back with a sharp pipe like this seems to be the most reasonable thing to do.Fox News is falling apart at the seams with all of the sexual harassment allegations being thrown at them, and also with Gretchen Carlson s $20 million settlement. The network also publicly apologized to her, and settled with a handful of other women as well.It also recently came out that they re guilty of hacking into the personal phones of journalists at other news outlets to find out who they were talking to. In short, Roger Ailes maintained one of the biggest tissues of lies ever: Running his network into the ground and calling it a success.The toilet is too lofty a place to describe the depths to which they have sunk.Van Susteren s website is Greta.com. Since it s her domain, it will go where she wants it to. That s her right, and Fox News can go suck it.Featured image by Nancy Ostertag/Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 These Two FANTASTIC Tweets Perfectly Show The Main Difference Between Hillary And Trump,"Last night, NBC hosted the Commander-in-Chief Forum in New York, where host Matt Lauer questioned Hillary and Trump for 30 minutes each (actually he put the screws to Hillary and lobbed puff balls at Trump, but that s beside the point). Hillary, as usual, was specific when answering questions, even those from veterans. Trump? Har de har har. His entire answer to every question boiled down to,  I have a plan, and it will work. Obama and Hillary have screwed this up for you, but my plan will fix it. In fact, the following tweets actually show the difference between Hillary and Trump when it comes to anything to do with policy:One striking contrast: How will you improve vets  mental health?Clinton: See my detailed plan, released last week Trump: The VA is corrupt  Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) September 8, 2016 Clinton: Points to specific allies and her 4,700-word mental health planTrump: Says he ll create something  great  to fix  corrupt  system  Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) September 8, 2016That s pretty much all Trump does. He makes grandiose but vague promises to take care of this, fix that, and more, and people believe him. He could say,  The VA is corrupt. Trust me. I know corrupt enterprises. I can spot them a mile away. The VA is definitely a corrupt enterprise, but I will fix it. We ll have the best veterans system in the world. The best. It ll be great,  and they ll just eat it up without question.That s why he s a demagogue.Meanwhile, we have Hillary Clinton in the other corner, who knows how to develop plans to handle things, and has actual, real ways to handle things, along with who will be enlisted to carry it out and/or help. She provides the specifics on her plans that Trump won t provide on his.That s the main difference between them now. Trump just says whatever he thinks people want to hear, and makes it vague enough that it ll be very easy for him to claim he never promised this, that or the other when, in fact, he did promise this, that or the other. Hillary actually tells people what they can expect.Photo of Hillary Clinton by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.

" Reince Priebus Mansplained Hillary’s Behavior During Forum, And It’s REPULSIVE (TWEET)","If there s one thing strong, successful women love to hear from men who are jealous of their success, it s how they should behave. With that previous sentence being clearly sarcasm if you possess a brain, it needs to be noted that s what RNC Chair Reince Priebus just did to Hillary Clinton while watching NBC s latest presidential forum discussing veterans and military issues.Priebus thought it wise to write: Hillary Clinton was angry and defensive the entire time   no smile and uncomfortable   upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets. @HillaryClinton was angry + defensive the entire time   no smile and uncomfortable   upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets.  Reince Priebus (@Reince) September 8, 2016Didn t you know that if you re to be taken seriously as a woman you need to be smiling at all times and look appealing? God forbid you have a face that reads you re taking Veteran issues very seriously and want to make sure they re given the respect and dignity they so rightfully deserve.This is yet just another example of a brutal double standard that still exists not only within modern politics but among the workplace in general.Donald Trump sat there during the entire forum without a smile on his face while discussing Veteran issues with NBC s Matt Lauer, but no one spoke of his lack of facial expression. Why? Because it s not expected of men. Women, on the other hand, are held to a different standard where they need to appear appealing at all times.It s bullshit is what it is.Let s stick to the issues, Priebus.Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Secret Meeting Reveals Trump Camp’s REAL Economic Plan, And It’s NOTHING Like What We’ve Heard","Trump has been telling the whole world about how he ll make our economy boom. He s going to cut taxes, but not cut Medicare or Social Security. He tells blue collar workers that he ll renegotiate all our trade agreements to bring their jobs back. He s going to balance the federal budget within seven years. He has something for everyone, but no plan to pay for any of it.Or does he?Trump s senior economic adviser, Stephen Moore, held a hush-hush meeting with the vice president of the Council for National Policy, Bill Walton. In that meeting, Moore revealed a lot of the ins and outs of the campaign s ideas for paying for his plan, and the whole thing smacks of far-right, free-market, trickle-down, anti-government conservatism unlike anything we ve seen before.Moore wants Trump to eliminate the Department of Education, Department of Commerce, and Department of Energy, just to start. That will cost, oh, about 150,000 jobs or so. Not to mention that, with the elimination of the Department of Commerce, we ll lose the U.S. Patent Office, the U.S. Census Bureau, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and more. Trump believes, however, that this is the source of a lot of crony capitalism and corporate welfare. So make it disappear!They also want to get rid of the Department of Education. That, however, will cost us a uniform accreditation process for colleges and universities, along with everything having to do with grants and student loans. No biggie, everyone can just get private student loans from their own banks, right? Right. Even if they re the poorest of the poor. They d have to, seeing as how it s not likely Congress will pass universal post-secondary education anytime soon.It s Moore that s pushing Trump to do something about the Department of Energy. including ending the energy subsidies. Eliminating the entire department will probably cost us every national laboratory we have that deals with energy research and development. This includes the famous Los Alamos National Laboratory, which was responsible for developing the atom bomb. They also work on nuclear research, cryogenics, and more (maybe they ll just hand these over to private companies with profit motives).He actually said, in that meeting: I mean, my God, why do we need an Energy Department? All the Energy Department has done in the last 25 years is make energy prices more expensive! Or it was due, at least in part, to giving utilities to private enterprises with a profit motive, but hey, he can think what he wants. They can, of course, move these agencies and offices to other departments, and maybe consolidate some, but the savings from doing this won t be near what they likely think.Moore believes in sending things like job training, health care and other medical services, back to the states. The federal government would give the states block grants to administer this stuff. Perhaps Trump would give them yuuuuuuuuuuuuuge block grants to administer all of the above things that will disappear with department elimination, too.And then they ll slowly go away as budgets get cut. States are notorious for finding ways around the strings attached to block grants, which allows them to divert that money to other things.But these kinds of proposals aren t exactly new for Republicans. What Moore also wants Trump to do is lift all (read: all) restrictions and regulations on mining, drilling and fracking. And here we have it: The answer to which energy subsidies would get cut. The ones going to renewables, because of course.Lifting the regulations on fossil fuel production would, in Moore s view, create 6 to 8 million new jobs. Those jobs would increase tax revenue. That, plus ending the subsidies to renewables so that fossil fuels no longer have competition, would bring a windfall of cash.Then Trump can pay for the tax cuts he plans to give his rich buddies.That is, of course, assuming that fossil fuel prices stay where they are, or rise. The energy companies have to see a profit in this plan, or they won t play ball. We can t stop the rest of the world from developing renewables and leaving us in the dust, and we can t stop OPEC from continuing to produce as much as they want to compete with us.Working as closely with a master businessman as Moore is, he should know that falling demand means falling prices. The energy companies have already put some brakes on fracking here because of the glut of oil worldwide. It s not as profitable to frack right now as they want.Plus, no regulation at all? Yeah. That ll work. You watch. It ll be great. We ll have the best market. Companies will become safer and more environmentally conscious because of competition.Or so the free-market capitalists  wet dreams say.Moore really hopes that Trump will climb on board with all of this. After all, Moore just wants to help his candidate  make America great again,  and clearly, this will do it. It s foolproof!Featured image by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Belittles Female Veteran, Embarrasses Himself With Totally Wrong Claim (VIDEO)","Donald Trump always believes he s right, no matter what, and even when speaking to a female veteran of the U.S. military he feels the need to be a bully. It happened again Wednesday night at the candidate forum on military issues on board the USS Intrepid.Rachel Fredericks specialized in aviations operations in the Marine Corps. She lost two friends to suicide, and she herself has post-traumatic stress disorder. During the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America Commander-in-Chief Forum Wednesday night, Fredericks asked Trump what he was going to do to stop 20 veterans a day from killing themselves. Actually, it s 22,  Trump replied.  It s almost impossible to conceive that this is happening in our country. But as the Huffington Post reports, Trump got it wrong and Ms. Fredericks was right. The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a report which revised the figures and pointed out that the tragic number of veteran suicides per day is 20.Trump couldn t let someone with far more experience than him on the issue offer her statement without butting in and attempting to override her. That behavior is part of a longstanding pattern on his behalf, a side effect of consistently surrounding himself with a series of  yes  men and women for decades now.It is also an indication of his leadership style, should he ever reach the presidency. Instead of listening to those who know better, or who have more experience, Trump only seems to pay attention to the voice in his head that always makes every issue under the sun about him.Even when the issue has been the conservative movement he now leads, Trump has done the same thing. Commenting on the recent death of anti-feminist activist Phyllis Schlafly, Trump misspelled her name in a tweet and encouraged people to buy the book she had recently written about him.In Trump s mind, he s the only one that matters.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Insists His Mexico Trip Was Successful For The Most Absurd Reason Ever,"As we all know, Republican presidential nominee went to Mexico last week in an attempt to look presidential. While on the surface it may have seemed that he succeeded at first, we soon learned that this was not the case. When asked about whether or not he and President Enrique Pena Nieto discussed payment for Trump s infamous border wall, Trump lied, and President Pena Nieta called him on it via Twitter. There s that, and we saw a tale of two Trumps that day, as when the real estate tycoon returned to the United States to do a rally in Arizona, he went right back to his hardline stance with a vengeance   so much so, in fact, that the Republican National Committee dropped plans to praise Trump because the speech was so hateful.Well, to hear Trump tell it, one event eclipses those mishaps to make Trump s trip a roaring success: the fact that one of the organizing officials of the trip from Mexico was just fired. Trump said Wednesday evening during NBC s Commander-in-Chief forum: We ve been badly hurt and if you look at the aftermath today, the people who arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government. That s how well we did, and that s how well we have to do. No, Mr. Trump, this is not an indicator that your trip was a success; quite the opposite, in fact. The official who was forced out of office, Finance Minister Luis Videgaray, left because the Mexican people have witnessed the appalling disrespect Trump has leveled at them throughout his travesty of a presidential campaign, and they did not want him in their country. Videgaray was a main champion of the Trump visit, and therefore it is damage control with the population of that country who are rightfully outraged that sparked this person s removal from office. That is the opposite of success.Then again, it s Trump, and therefore he can t help twisting the facts to make himself look good. So, no surprise there. The trip wasn t a success; in fact, it was clearly anything but.Featured image via by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Nominates FIRST Muslim For A Federal Judgeship,"History is once again being made thanks to President Obama. On Wednesday, Obama nominated Abid Riaz Qureshi to serve as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, filling the vacancy left by Judge Rosemary Collyer (who took senior status).Qureshi s nomination makes him the first Muslim to be nominated for a federal judgeship and, if confirmed, the first Muslim federal judge in American history.With a commitment to serve the American people with integrity and a steadfast commitment to justice,  as President Obama said, Qureshi is a graduate of Cornell University and Harvard University and currently works at the law firm Latham & Watkins LLP. Qureshi specializes in healthcare fraud and securities violations.Not only is Qureshi a partner at Latham & Watkins (a position he s held since 2006), he is the global chair of the firm s Pro Bono Committee, and serves on the Legal Ethics Committee of the District of Columbia Bar.An accomplished lawyer, who happens to be Muslim, will not get his day in the Senate (should the obstructionist Republicans allow it) and make history.And of course conservatives are going to be furious when they find out that   gasp   Muslims can serve in public office! Fortunately to sanity and justice, the United States Constitution has a No Religious Test clause under Article VI: ;but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.So say the Founders, who seemed to be very cordial and accepting of Muslims.The United States Constitution has this clause to ward off hateful bigots who think their religion is the only one that matters, and President Obama is taking full advantage of it, and rightfully so. Qureshi isn t qualified because he s a Muslim, he s just a qualified attorney who happens to be Muslim.Here s to hoping history will once again be made, and Republicans will give this man a fair hearing and a speedy up-and-down vote.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" CNN FINALLY Does Its Job, Hammers Trump With His Illegal Donations (VIDEO)","CNN s Alisyn Camerota did something on Wednesday that s almost unheard of from CNN: She called out Donald Trump on his many, many scandals and in particular, the pay and play scandal involving Trump s bribing of Florida s Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi, who, after receiving a donation from Trump, dropped an investigation into Trump University.This isn t an allegation. Trump paid the donation, and he paid an IRS fine of $2,500 for breaking the law. Still, the media generally only talks about the Clinton Foundation or Clinton emails, both of which have amounted to absolutely nothing.Trump s entire narrative, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, is to paint her as  crooked Hillary,  a moniker that, despite sounding like it comes from a third grade bully who s been held back a few times, is sticking. That nickname is pure projection, though. It s Trump who s crooked and Camerota pointed it out: Congressman,  Camerota said,  don t you think the American public cares about breaking the law? Well, these are technicalities in many cases,  (Rep. Chris Collins R-NY) Collins said,  as he pointed out on the recent Bondi one. He was solicited for a donation, he told his clerk to do it. She wrote it out of the wrong checking account. Source: Raw StoryThen, back to  crooked Hillary,  Collins tried to make the claim that she did it too, which is completely untrue, since while some donors to the Clinton Foundation did ask for meetings, most were told to go through regular channels. With Trump and Bondi, however, it was clear quid pro quo. He gave her money and she dropped the case against him. For that, both parties should be in jail.Camerota pressed on: Let s look back,  she said, pointing out that in 1985, Trump was caught exceeding legal campaign donation limits by funneling funds through 18 subsidiary companies, which is technically legal, but is essentially a corporate version of the crime that sent right-wing provocateur Dinesh D Souza to federal prison.Cameron went on to describe actual illegalities that Trump has been fined for. Isn t this the very definition of payola?  Camerota asked.  Payola is the practice of bribing someone to use their influence to promote your particular interest. How does this differ? Collins kept on with his both sides do it argument until Camerota astutely mentioned the one key difference: what Trump did was illegal. What Clinton did wasn t. Who s the  crooked  candidate again?Here s the interview:GOP Rep. Chris Collins says Clinton  has always been someone with her hand out  for donors https://t.co/dH2DDZP72k pic.twitter.com/YuxTgFpbcm  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 7, 2016If only we could get the rest of the media, or for what that s worth, the rest of CNN, to do their jobs. If you notice, even the tweet from CNN tried to make Clinton the criminal subject of the interview, not Trump. In other words, don t hold your breath for a better CNN, but Camerota was a breath of fresh air.Featured image via video screen capture.

 Hillary Completely Blew Away This Woman Who Receives Terrifying Hate From The Alt-Right,"When Ella Dawson started a blog discussing her trials with genital herpes, along with STI stigma, she expected prudes to come out of the woodwork and snipe at her for putting such a personal topic out for all to see. What she didn t expect was for the dangerous alt-right to find her and make her a target for their sick form of entertainment.When she decided to write about that, she likely also didn t expect to catch the attention of Hillary Clinton, let alone grab it enough to receive a personal letter back.The letter starts with: Thank you for the brave and insightful piece on Medium this week. I am so grateful for you for not only speaking out against the stigma surrounding sexually transmitted infections, but for also taking a courageous stand against the ridiculous, but very real, barrage of hate you have received online. She reiterated that love and kindness are among the central components of her campaign, and that the decline of civil public discourse is one of the more alarming problems in the digital age. Then she dropped this truth bomb: It s going to take all of us, working together, to restore our discourse and that work starts by calling out the bullies, chief among them Donald Trump and the alt-right. Read the whole letter below:Thank you, @HillaryClinton, for reading. I m incredibly moved. To be accurate, I m ugly crying. #ImWithHer pic.twitter.com/kt5tAVWrFX  Ella Dawson (@brosandprose) September 6, 2016The blog post that caught Hillary s attention discusses Dawson s very real and terrible problems with the alt-right. Her broader discussion, though, is about how rape threats, death threats, doxxing, shaming, and more, happen to women all over the Internet because we dare to Internet while female. The sheer gall of us to have an opinion and put it out there   we should, in the eyes of the misogynistic alt-right, stay silent. We bring the harassment on ourselves in their view.What s worse is that some of the people harassing Dawson aren t the typical cretins that inhabit the alt-right. Mike Cernovich, who s a lawyer, but more well-known for his sexist Internet presence, tweeted: Ugly and has herpes. Maybe an SJW male might actually be able to get at these table scraps. (Doubtful). Paul Joseph Watson, an editor-at-large at Alex Jones  InfoWars, recorded a five-minute YouTube video talking about how vile were the women who were tweeting under the hashtag #ShoutYourStatus for STD Awareness Month. He ended it with the typical sexist attack of: I don t think we should be that surprised that feminists are bragging about their STDs. After all, they re so fat and ugly, the mere fact that they re having any kind of sex at all is a massive achievement. Because the women the alt-right considers to be their eye candy all know their places and would never be so hateful towards men as to become a feminist. Sure.The response to that video caused Dawson to lock her Twitter account, lest Breitbart writers, and other misogynistic writers, embed her tweets in their stories, causing an ever-growing cycle of harassment. A man writing about this stuff would never receive this treatment. Ever.That s what Hillary knows, and has dealt with as a strong woman in a position of power for most of her life. Hillary stood up in Reno and read off Breitbart headlines while many other women are afraid to even mention that cesspool of a news site. Dawson has been a Hillary supporter for years, but her admiration for Hillary went through the roof when she witnessed this speech.Dawson ended her post with a thank-you to Hillary for having the guts (yes, it takes guts to stand up to the hate of the alt-right) to call the alt-right out for what it is. Misogyny, racism, white nationalism, white supremacy, anti-Semitism, and all-around hate are what the alt-right is about. That s despite the fact that, according to Dawson, they delusionally bill themselves as: [A] trendy new generation of conservatism, pushing boundaries and buttons in response to political correctness and liberal oversensitivity. Please. That is vile on its face.Bravo to Dawson for continuing to Internet while female, and bravo to Hillary for standing with her. That is what makes a president.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservatives Raise Hell Over Obama’s Wedding Ring With Dumbest Conspiracy Ever (SCREENSHOTS),"Those wacky conservatives are at it again with a new, insane attempt to invent an Obama  scandal.  So what did Barack  Barry  Hussein Soetoro Obama Bin Laden do this time? Did he allow someone else to hold his umbrella? Order mustard on something? Put his feet on his own desk? No, what President Obama did this time was far more insidious   he didn t wear his wedding ring during a public appearance, which apparently proves he s a gay Muslim homersexual who married a man (at least, according to our frenemies on the right wing).The American Mirror s Kyle Olson noticed that during Obama s visit to Laos, he appears to not be wearing his wedding ring. Now, you re probably thinking  so f*cking what? I take mine off from time to time.  But this is apparently a big deal. A really f*cking big deal, as far as Olson and his vapid readers are concerned.Noting that  it s not the first time Obama has shed his wedding ring  and that Michelle Obama was not with him on the trip, Olson put the information out there for his ridiculous fanbase so their imaginations could run wild:This perfectly innocent photograph of the President not wearing his ring resurrected long-dead conservative talking points   like that his wedding ring is really a secret Muslim decoder ring that says  Allah is the one true God  in crazy Muslim-y inscriptions only conservatives can read (multiple language scholars have pointed out that the ring s design has no meaning in Arabic).Others saw this as proof that Michelle Obama is a really a man, their marriage is in shambles and teetering on the  D-word,  and Mr. Barry has multiple gay lovers (like all those old men he used to bang for cocaine, don tchaknow). Others speculated that he was having a romp playing with Laotian  ladyboys  while he was down there.        Surely we can expect the ridiculous conspiracy theories surrounding Ringhazi to continue. While you re busy laughing at the stupidity of the segment of our society with nothing better to do than invent insane conspiracy theories about our President, be sure to remember that these vapid numbskulls will be voting in November. Make sure you re there, too.Featured image via screengrab",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Privileged Trump Supporter Cries ‘Discrimination’ When Bakery Won’t Make ‘Trump 2016’ Cake (VIDEO),"Most of us know that Donald Trump s fanbase is made up of some of the most privileged members of American society. A good majority of Trump supporters are straight white men (and some women) who have never been faced with a true obstacle or discrimination a day in their life. But if you ask them, they d likely only complain about how oppressed they are   and this recent incident between a bakery and a Trump supporter is a perfect example.This week, 17-year-old Trump supporter McKenzie Gill went to get a birthday cake made up at her local Albertsons. To prove just how much of a die-hard fan she was of the business mogul, she wanted her cake to read  Trump 2016   a celebration of both her 18th birthday and the mark of her first vote in America s election process.However, things didn t exactly go according to plan. When Gill went to order the cake, the woman behind the counter refused to put  Trump 2016  on it. She said she could put an American flag design on the cake, but definitely not the words  Trump 2016.  In response, Gill took after her yellow-haired role model and threw a temper tantrum on social media. In a Facebook post, she wrote: The woman behind the cake counter just refused to make me a birthday cake because I wanted  Trump 2016  on it. Did that really just happen? FacebookGill got her cake made up elsewhere and made a formal complaint to Albertsons about being refused. Albertsons apologized and said that the women who d refused to write  Trump 2016  on the cake had misunderstood the store s policy to not use copyrighted phrases in its designs. In an interview, Gill said: It s your job, we re not really going for your opinion on what you think of the candidates we were just wanting  Trump 2016  on the cake.

 Watch Trump Campaign Try To Spin Their Way Out Of ‘I Love War’ Comment (VIDEO),"A new ad by the Hillary Clinton SuperPac Priorities USA was released on Tuesday. It s perhaps the most frightening of all because it directly quotes Trump saying,  I love war,  and specifically, he loves nuclear war.Here s the ad:FactCheck did their due diligence with the ad and the biggest complaint they could find is that the direct quotes from Trump came from two different times. Still, here are his entire quotes:Trump, Nov. 12, 2015: This is the Trump theory on war. But I m good at war. I ve had a lot of wars of my own. I m really good at war. I love war, in a certain way, but only when we win.And then the second half, a few months later he talked about nukes:Trump: It s not like, gee whiz, nobody has them.So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.Wallace: With nukes?Trump: Maybe they would be better off   including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.So, now that we ve confirmed that yes, Trump does love war, how is his campaign going to spin that?Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway appeared on Good Morning America on Wednesday and it was clear she was out of her league, even though most of the questions weren t that hard hitting.At first, she deflected:Conway responded that what is actually  irresponsible  is  taking little, cherry-picking little snippets of what he said and not giving the full context of the sentence let alone the speech. This woman was secretary of state for four years. And I think the reason she s struggling in the polls part is because aren t really fond of that record and she will be held account for that record,  Conway said, ripping into Clinton over her recent polling troubles.  She s actually been in control of many aspects of our national security and our troops and our defense and I think that given all of her advantages, including her super PAC including her campaign hang spent over $200 million most in paid advertising one wonders why is she not at 50, 60 percent in the polls. Why isn t she at 60, 65 percent among women? Hillary Clinton has a Hillary Clinton problem. Source: PoliticoWhen pressed further, she still had no explanation: I d have to see the entire snippet there but obviously many commanders in chief have made the very difficult decision to go to war,  Conway responded.  You have Hillary Clinton as secretary of state calling a Russia reset that didn t work, she was wrong on Libya, she was wrong on Syria, she was certainly wrong on Benghazi and I think they ll both be held to account for that. Here s her spin: ABC Breaking News | Latest News VideosThe fact is that Trump does love war and he has no concept whatsoever of the ramifications of his actions. In a national security briefing, Trump asked three times why we can t use nuclear weapons. If you aren t frightened by Trump s racism, sexism or xenophobia, please be frightened by the fact that he has complete disregard for the damage war, and in particular, nuclear weapons, can inflict. Be frightened over his dangerous stupidity.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Morning Joe Knows Trump Bribed Pam Bondi Because He Brags About Buying Politicians,"The Morning Joe panel just NAILED Donald Trump to the wall.The Republican nominee and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi have denied that that there was any pay-to-play going on between them when he made a sizable donation to her before she killed the case the Trump University in her state.Trump donated $25,000 to Bondi via his  charity,  which is illegal and resulted in a $2,500 fine from the IRS. Bondi dropped the case. And then Trump held a discounted fundraiser for her at his Mar-a-Lago resort.Definitely sounds fishy, doesn t it? That s especially true when you consider that Trump has bragged about paying politicians to do his bidding.And the Morning Joe crew had absolutely no problem talking about that history of foot-in-mouth disease on Wednesday. Trump has said in the past that he gave money to politicians for favors,  Mark Halperin said before calling on Trump and Bondi to release any and all documents pertaining to the donation to prove there was no quid pro quo. To put this to rest, he should put out all of the documentation from his office. How did this contribution come to be made? Where s the paperwork? Where are the emails? Where are the memos that say,  Hey, let s, right now, give Pam Bondi some money. By the way improperly through our charity.  And, Pam Bondi s office should put out all the internal emails from her office that talk about the decision not to make him part of the litigation. Maybe there s not any connection, but the onus is on them now. It s a strange bit of timing, because, again, Trump has bragged,  Halperin continued.  This is what he did. He gave money to politicians in order to control his decisions to get favorable results. And he said that s how he succeeded. Mika Brzezinski then jumped in and noted that the timeline is incredibly suspicious before confirming Halperin s remarks about Trump having a history of paying lawmakers for favors. You can see a timeline and a direct result of the money,  Brzezinski said. Which is what he says he does with money, he buys people off. He makes deals. And he got a deal to not be investigated in an area where he has a real weak spot and that s Trump University. I ve never seen a campaign and a family get more defensive than when you bring up Trump University because they have a weak spot there. Mika went on to say that it is a weak spot because there are so many people who have been scammed by Trump University.Here s the video via Twitter.Trump denies political motives behind FL Atty. Gen. donation  @morningmika: Trump University is  a real weak spot  https://t.co/MNmesaiHXX  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) September 7, 2016But that s not all.Later on in the show Brzezinski actually laid out the timeline of Trump s donation and Bondi s subsequent dropping of the case against Trump University.Brzezinski noted that as bad of some of the accusations against Hillary look, there are no connection  dot to dot  like there are on this Trump scandal. The 2013 donation by the Donald J. Trump Foundation was made four days after it was announced that Bondi said she was considering joining New York State s investigation into Trump University,  she reported.The panel went on to explain that this is why Donald Trump should be forced to hand over his tax returns because they would show all of Trump s shady financial dealings over the years.Here s the video via YouTube.It s time for the IRS to end the audit of Trump s tax returns so that he no longer has that silly excuse to use. But Trump s pay-to-play scandal with Pam Bondi proves that he is untrustworthy and will likely use the government to help himself if he should become president. This kind of corruption should concern all voters, which makes it all the more amazing that Trump isn t losing by a wider margin. Apparently, conservatives like their presidents corrupt and ignorant.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mural Of Gov. LePage Wearing KKK Garb Has Maine City In Uproar (IMAGE),"The city of Portland, Maine has been thrown into pandemonium after a mural of the state s bigoted governor decked out in full Ku Klux Klan regalia appeared.The original graffiti art was painted onto the wall of the Portland Water District s wastewater treatment plant and featured Maine Gov. Paul LePage donning the trademark hood and robe of the KKK. Given the slew of racist remarks that he spews almost continuously, the image is fairly fitting. Next to the 6-foot-high likeness of LePage are the words racist,   homophobe  and  moron.   Governor,  the last word listed, is crossed out with a red line.City won t remove graffiti of ""racist"" Maine Gov. LePage wearing KKK hood https://t.co/9KkhiUSVPp pic.twitter.com/PNvIaJhiob  Talking Points Memo (@TPM) September 6, 2016The wall art sparked a string of graffiti and the image has since undergone several transformations. Portland resident Mark Reilly painted over the image with white paint, then a group of women scrubbed off his cover-up. By 10pm on Tuesday, the image had been reduced to just LePage s face with Mickey Mouse ears above his head. All references to the KKK were gone and the mural now reads only No Hate  and  Hate is Hate. As for city officials, they have been in turmoil over what should be down about the graffiti as well. Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling wanted the image removed. I do not want it up there. It is not reflective of our values,  Strimling said Tuesday.  The KKK has a long, problematic history in the state of Maine, and equating the governor and his rhetoric, as much as we disagree with it, is a step too far. The wall belongs to the Portland Water District and they have not removed graffiti from the wall in decades and has been treated as a public canvas. City officials initially said that they had no intention of removing the image, citing free speech. But later in the day, water district spokeswoman Michelle Clements said that the city and the district s general manager were discussing what should be done about the mural.Strimling, who has been known to be at odds with the Republican governor, clarified on Tuesday that his reasoning for suggesting that the mural should be removed had nothing to do with concern for LePage. I am as frustrated as the next person with the governor s rhetoric,  he said.  It is not appropriate to trivialize the KKK. LePage has a bad habit of letting his racism hang out for the world to see on a regular basis. He made headlines a few months ago when said black guys named  shifty  are coming into his state to sell drugs and impregnate young white girls. More recently, he said that he is at  war  and declared black people to be the enemy. A few days later, when he heard a rumor that a colleague had called him a racist, he decided to leave a ranting voicemail calling him a  cocksucker.  He has since promised that he will never talk to the media again so that they are less likely to catch him saying racist things.Featured image via WCVB",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Pro-Clinton Group Launches Devastating Nuclear War Ad Against Trump,"In what s being compared to the infamous  Daisy  commercial from the 1964 election, a pro-Clinton group released a devastating new ad targeting Donald Trump and his love for war and nuclear destruction.Priorities America, which has been supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and other down ballot Democrats, released the ad earlier this month, and will pour more than $5 million into broadcasting the ad on Friday in six key battleground states: Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada and Iowa.Painting Trump as a temperamental, impulsive hawk has been a cornerstone in the Clinton defense strategy, and this ad, though not affiliated with her campaign, seeks to solidify that. Earlier in the summer, the Clinton campaign began running ads showcasing Trump s impulsive and dangerous rhetoric, saying that one wrong move could be the difference between peace and World War III.This ad, however, is different. Like the 1964  Daisy  ad, this one showcased the infamous mushroom cloud explosion and its destructive consequences. Appropriately titled  I Love War,  the crux of the ad stems from Trump s comment made back in November during the Republican primary. While speaking to a crowd in Fort Dodge, Iowa, Trump reassured his hawkish and loyal followers that he loved and was  good  at war: I m good at war. I ve had a lot of wars of my own. I m really good at war. I love war in a certain way, but only when we win. Also shown was Trump s affinity for nuclear devastation, in which he told CNN,  Nuclear, just the power, the devastation, is very important to me. So Priorities America laid it out: we have a candidate who loves war, and is very good at it. So when the mushroom cloud strikes, don t be surprised.Of course the Trump campaign responded, and pathetically tried to put his  I love war  quote into context, but ended up using the opportunity to blast the media and Hillary Clinton s poll numbers (which are better than Trump s, might I add) and, surprise, brought up Benghazi. So they actually didn t clarify what he meant, rather they deflected by pointing the finger at Hillary and avoiding the problem altogether.Typical Trump campaign.Watch the brutal ad here: Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Dallas Morning News Endorses Hillary Clinton – The First Democrat In 75 Years,"Something big happened in Texas, and Hillary Clinton is going to love it.The Dallas Morning News, a highly conservative publication that has always supported Republicans, made the shocking announcement they would not be endorsing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and instead threw their support behind Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Here s why that s a big deal.The paper, which made its endorsement Wednesday morning, wrote that the decision was not easily reached, but acknowledged the significance:This newspaper has not recommended a Democrat for the nation s highest office since before World War II   if you re counting, that s more than 75 years and nearly 20 elections. The party s over-reliance on government and regulation to remedy the country s ills is at odds with our belief in private-sector ingenuity and innovation. Our values are more about individual liberty, free markets and a strong national defense.We ve been critical of Clinton s handling of certain issues in the past. But unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton has experience in actual governance, a record of service and a willingness to delve into real policy.The only other time the News neglected to endorse a Republican was in 1964 when Barry Goldwater ran   although they did not endorse Lyndon B. Johnson.While the News was not head over heels for Clinton, chiding her for her  dodgy  nature and  her willingness to shade the truth,  the conclusion was made that her bipartisan approach to governing offered a stark contrast to Trump s campaign of  exploiting base instincts of xenophobia, racism and misogyny. Flying in the face of typical conservative speak, the News also shot down the ridiculous alt-right conspiracy theories that she is treasonous and a murderer. Avoiding the unnecessary gobbledygook that comes with Republican talking points (they referred to these people as  political hyenas ), the News finished with a straightforward appeal to its readers:After nearly four decades in the public spotlight, 25 of them on the national stage, Clinton is a known quantity. For all her warts, she is the candidate more likely to keep our nation safe, to protect American ideals and to work across the aisle to uphold the vital domestic institutions that rely on a competent, experienced president.Hillary Clinton has spent years in the trenches doing the hard work needed to prepare herself to lead our nation. In this race, at this time, she deserves your vote.And just like that, a Republican newspaper that never dared to endorse a Democrat has endorsed arguably the most famous Democratic feminist this country has ever seen. Of course the readers were upset with the News, calling the editorial board  sellouts,   pathetic,   shameful,  etc. Some even accused DNC operatives of coercing or bribing the board to endorse Clinton.When Republicans feel threatened, they pounce. And the irony is so rich   the same  political hyenas  the News espoused as crazy conspiracy theorists are now flocking to their website, accusing them of being DNC or Clinton plants.You ve got to love what the Republicans have turned into. No wonder the News endorsed Clinton. And the timing is great. A recent Washington Post/SurveryMonkey poll has Clinton winning Texas by 1 point over Donald Trump.While not a Hillary Clinton love fest, the paper did show amazing courage in standing up for what is right, putting country before politics.Featured image via Mark Makela/Getty Images",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mark Cuban RIPS Fox Host For Judging Clinton Speaking Fees – Reagan Was Paid MORE (VIDEO),"Billionaire Mark Cuban had previously been rooting for Donald Trump, but made the switch over to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with a powerful public endorsement several weeks ago after wisely deciding that Trump was batsh*t crazy. Since then, he has fiercely defended the Clintons and he continued to do so on Monday, when Fox News  Neil Cavuto complained about Hillary s email  scandal  and the fees former President Bill Clinton charges for speaking events.Cavuto brought up the fact that Bill Clinton had gotten $250,000 for a speech and Cuban wasted no time in dismantling his criticism. Cuban completely ripped Cavuto apart as he educated the Fox Business News host about what ex-presidents actually make for speaking, and threw in some conservative shame when he mentioned Reagan: Look. You have to ask yourself what s the market for a former president giving a speech, right? So first of all, Ronald Reagan was paid more than a million dollars for speeches in 1989. He went to Japan and gave two speeches. Second of all, Bill Clinton made, I think it was $250K give or take, for a lot of speeches. I ve made $250K for a bunch of speeches. For the most part, he gets paid a little more than I do, but the point is he was right inside the market. He wasn t getting paid more or less than the market. But Cavuto wasn t ready to give up slamming the Clintons that quickly. He made the foolish decision to continue bashing Clinton, whining that the money had gone to the Clinton Foundation in a  pay for play  scheme. Cuban was ready to handle those accusations as well. He shut it down: In order to determine if there is any quid pro quo, there s got to be some money destined for the trade-off. Cavuto tried to say it looked suspicious, but Cuban countered,  they ve been investigated more than anybody.

 General DESTROYS Trump For Insulting The Military (VIDEO),"A retired general has had enough of Donald Trump denigrating the men and women of the U.S. military currently engaged in the fight against ISIS and other terrorist elements. In an appearance on CNN, retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling blasted Trump for his recent claim that simply asking generals to come up with a plan to defeat ISIS would lead to the terrorist group s end in a neat and tidy thirty-day period.The former commanding general decried Trump, calling his orders  simplistic  and insulting to individuals working to defeat ISIS. It shows a complete lack of understanding of the threat and the ways to fight it,  Hertling said.  It s a sophomoric approach to elements of national security policy because if he s just calling in the military, he s missing the point that there are several other elements of national security that will help defeat ISIS. Trump has been all over the map on ISIS, as he has been on hundreds of other issues. The former reality TV star has claimed that ISIS is on the march (it is in retreat) and that he has a plan to defeat ISIS (which he is keeping secret). Trump has also claimed that he knows more than all the generals on how to win the war on terrorism.In reality, Trump s reckless comments have proven to be the right kind of material for ISIS leaders attempting to recruit new members. Compared to the measured tones offered by President Obama and Secretary Hillary Clinton, Trump s rhetoric attacking Islam often sounds like the clash of civilizations the radical Muslim world wants so badly.Daily, American military assets are fighting against ISIS elements, most notably American fighter jets that have been bombing ISIS targets in multiple countries for years now, in addition to work via intelligence agencies with governments fighting the ISIS threat. To minimize their work as Trump does is a clear insult.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Threw Mar-A-Lago Fundraiser For Woman At The Center Of Bribery Scandal,"Just a few days after she made the decision to let an investigation of Donald Trump s Trump University slide, the former reality TV star held a fundraiser for Florida attorney general Pam Bondi at his palatial Mar-A-Lago compound.News of the cash-fueled party comes as Trump faces renewed criticism after being fined by the IRS after it came to light that the Trump Foundation illegally funneled money into Bondi s re-election campaign.In March 2014, Donald Trump opened his 126-room Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, for a $3,000-per-person fundraiser for Pam Bondi. The Florida attorney general, who was facing a tough re-election campaign, had recently decided not to investigate Trump University.Trump did not write a check to the attorney general that night. The previous fall, his personal foundation had given $25,000 to a pro-Bondi PAC. But by hosting her fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago and bringing in some of his own star power, Trump provided Bondi s campaign with a nice financial boost.The Huffington Post also reports that while Trump has billed the RNC $140,000 per event to use his mansion, he only charged the Republican Party of Florida $4,855.65. That means that Trump stands to make a windfall simply by controlling the flow of campaign donor money to his own enterprises.News of the interlocking relationship between Trump and Bondi (she has done campaign rallies for him) underscores how the national media has ignored or played down actual stories of Trump and his involvement with corruption. Instead they have banged the drums on the Clinton Foundation, making allegations of wrong-doing based on the potential and  optics  of the far-reaching charity the Clintons put in place.Trump is also implicated in similar behavior in Texas. The attorney general there dropped looking into Trump University a little after he gave him a financial donation.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ann Coulter Goes Full Bigot – Calls Khizr Khan A ‘Snarling Muslim’ In Televised Rant (VIDEO),"Conservative commentator and devout Trump lover Ann Coulter let her bigotry all hang out on Monday when she attacked Khizr Khan, the father of a slain American soldier, calling him a  snarling Muslim. During an appearance on Sky News Australia s The Bolt Report, Coulter attacked the father of Humayun Khan, who gave his life fighting for the United States in Iraq. His heroism saved the lives of the men serving by his side.But conservatives like Coulter could care less and have sought to crucify the grieving father ever since his speech at the Democratic National Convention. During his fiery DNC speech, Khan blasted Donald Trump for  the blackness of his character.  He then asked if the GOP nominee if he had ever even bothered to read the Constitution and offered to lend the bigoted billionaire his copy.Australian commentator Andrew Bolt, host of the show, told Coulter that he thought it was wrong for anyone, including Donald Trump, to viciously go after the parents of a  soldier who died in battle.  At this point, Coulter complained about the  media s endless attack on Trump  and then went full-on bigot, calling Khizr Khan a  snarling Muslim. I don t know America very well if they want to listen to a snarling Muslim lecture them and tell us we re not allowed to have opinions on important public policy issues unless we had a son die in Iraq,  she said.Watch Ann Coulter flaunt her bigotry here:.@AnnCoulter says Americans don't want a 'snarling Muslim' to lecture them.

 Disabled Americans Fight Back After Being Stripped Of Their Right To Vote (AUDIO),"Throughout America, tens of thousands of people who live with disabilities have been stripped of their right to vote, usually because someone has been awarded guardianship. But now, some disabled Americans are fighting back and demanding that their voting rights be restored.In 2011, California resident David Rector suffered a traumatic brain injury and was left unable to walk or talk. His fiance, Rosalind Alexander-Kasparik was appointed as his conservator, which under state law meant Rector also lost his right to vote.Now, Rector has filed a request with the Superior Court in San Diego to have his voting rights restored. Alexander-Kasparik said that despite his disability, Rector is fully capable of expressing his wishes to a court clerk. Outside of the courthouse, she told supporters that he had been able to communicate his desire to vote while speaking to the judge. He did manage to say through his electronic voice on his eye-tracking device,  I, David Rector, want my voting rights restored, immediately,'  Alexander-Kasparik said.The importance of this cannot be overstated since California law requires that people with disabilities express their desire to vote before they are granted the right to do so.Rector, who was a producer for NPR, is one of at least 30,000 people in California who have been stripped of their right to vote because they have a disability. Nationally, the number of people who have lost their voting rights under state guardianship laws is not even known.David Rector and Rosalind Alexander-Kasparik. Image via The Root.Jennifer Mathis, director of policy and legal advocacy at the Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law in Washington DC, explained the problem with the current systems that are in place. The problem with those laws is that a determination of guardianship or competence really has nothing to do with someone s ability to vote. They have to do with someone s ability to ensure their basic health and safety needs,  she said.Mathis added that just because a person isn t able to do one thing, that doesn t necessarily mean that they can t do another. However, that isn t a distinction that courts across the country tend to consider. Only eleven states do not automatically strip a disabled person of their voting rights when someone is awarded guardianship. But each state has different laws on the issue. Some automatically revoke a person s right to vote when someone is awarded guardianship.Other states make people with disabilities prove that they want to vote. According to Mathis, this amounts to disabled people being held to a higher standard and violates the Voting Rights Act. Those people end up having to answer questions like: Who s the governor? Who s the president? Who s the mayor? Why do you want to vote? How would you vote on a particular issue? And those are exactly the type of questions we never would impose on voters without disabilities,  she said.Mathis noted that a lot of times, people are not even aware that their rights have been stripped because of the complicated nature of the guardianship process.Last year, Californa softened its law, allowing for rights to be restored if a person expressed a desire to vote. Republican State Senator Jeff Stone oppposed the measure and argued that  desire  does not necessarily equal  competency. I think this bill is equating desire to vote with the competency to vote. A conservatee may want to drive a car, but may not be competent or able to drive a car and get a license is a perfect example,  Stone said.On Aug. 29, the judge in Rector s case decided that she wasn t yet convinced that he really wants his right to vote back, despite the fact that he stood in her courtroom and told her point blank to her face that he did.Alexander-Kasparik said she s hopeful Rector will win his case but said she is still disappointed that he will have to wait even longer. That hurts. I think that hurts David. I know it hurt me. It hurt me for David,  she said.  And it hurt me for, you know, all those people out.. As she spoke, Rector let out a loud moan. That s David s response. Did you hear it?  she asked.Alexander-Kasparik said that Rector is better informed than most voters and follows the news closely. Like the rest of us paying attention the current state of politics in America, Rector is eager to vote in November so his voice can be heard. Whether or not they can convince a judge of that remains to be seen, though.Listen to more here, via NPR:Featured image via NPR",News,"September 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary’s Hires Show Clear Progressive Influence From The Warren Wing Of The Democratic Party,"Elizabeth Warren wants a say in who Hillary Clinton hires to be part of her administration s transition team. In fact, Warren made a list of names she absolutely will not accept and Clinton seems to be receptive.According to Politico, Warren has vowed to fight any political appointments or nominees with ties to big banks. She also wants to shut down the government-to-corporate revolving door.The liberal wing s early jockeying is already paying off. POLITICO reported this week that Rohit Chopra, who was hired by Warren at the CFPB, is joining Clinton s transition team. And Heather Boushey, popular among progressives because of her focus on income inequality, was recently chosen as the team s chief economist. Liberals applauded both hires as a sign Clinton is taking them seriously.What is more, the Democratic Party platform embraced the senator s position that only officials  who are not beholden to the industries they regulate  should get appointments.One of the biggest complaints about Hillary Clinton is exactly the same complaint many had about her husband as president: she s a political being and yes, she does sometimes base her actions on the polls. The cynical call this type of politicking  pandering,  but there are many who call it democratic. Or, to put it another way, after more than 30 years of the country taking a big swing to the right, we re seeing the pendulum swing back to the left. Clinton has read the writing on the wall thanks to Warren, and well, she can t afford to be center-right.Warren and other progressives are holding Clinton to her more populist promises through the think tank, the Roosevelt Institute, whose mission is to fight income inequality and corporate control. Felicia Wong, who heads the Roosevelt Institute, is in pretty much constant contact with Clinton s team.The goal, (Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam) Green said, is to have more people associated with Warren and Stiglitz represented in positions throughout the government,  and not just Robert Rubin clones.  Rubin, who once co-chaired Goldman Sachs and was a top executive at Citigroup, was a Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, where he pushed for market deregulation and deficit reduction.If Clinton wins, her administration will likely be hounded by progressive watch dogs, and that s exactly what she needs. Progressives are a large voting bloc, and if we let ourselves, we can also become a powerful one, even with a nominee who s not Bernie Sanders.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images.",News,"September 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 2016 Campaign Coverage WRECKS ‘Liberal Media Bias’ Myth,"If there is one thing the 2016 election has shown, it s that there is no such thing as a liberal media bias. From free air time for Donald Trump to ridiculous, over sensationalized bad press for Hillary Clinton, the media conglomerates have shown there is a preferred candidate, and it certainly isn t the liberal one.Not only has broadcast media shown itself to be completely inept and biased in favor of Donald Trump, but print and digital media, which younger voters rely on more heavily than anyone else, has shown its true colors as well. It is not liberal, but it does have a bias, and it certainly isn t in favor of Hillary Clinton.It all stems from when the Associated Press released shock waves through the political establishment when it  reported  on the Clinton Foundation s alleged pay-for-play, hinting that Hillary Clinton used her power as Secretary of State to give preferential, special treatment to donors and heads of state involved with her family foundation. Similarly, the New York Times and Boston Globe picked up the story with eerily similar tones, calling on the Clinton Foundation to be shutdown, Clinton herself investigated, and castes doubts on her ability to be  ethical. Not surprisingly, Republicans pounced on the story. But even liberal hacks like Vice s Michael Tracey and IBT s David Sirota, who are openly to the left of Mrs. Clinton s political leanings, were calling for the secretary s head on a silver platter. Once again, the seeds of distrust among liberals were sown.Well, then the truth came out and it turns out the AP botched the story. As pointed out by AMERICAblog News editor John Aravosis the AP incorrectly reported that half of those who met with Clinton as cabinet secretary gave money to the Clinton Foundation. The Associated Press gave the number as 85 out of 154 people.It doesn t take a genius to see the one glaring giveaway: does anyone really think that Clinton, who was secretary of state for four years and had the record travel mileage and country visitation, met with only 154 people during her tenure? The fact is this: Clinton met, personally, with over 1,700 people as secretary of state, of which then only 85 were foundation donors, which equals a measly 5 percent.Aravosis also points out that the AP blew their  smoking gun  claim when referring to Muhammed Yunus, a major donor of the Clinton Foundation who was able to meet with Secretary Clinton herself. Considering Yunus has won an Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless efforts to reduce global poverty, and banking empowerment for poor people, it would seem almost normal for him to meet with Clinton (who made global poverty alleviation a staple in her smart diplomacy agenda at the State Department).My God, Hillary Clinton, whose job it is to work with other countries to tackle global issues (which includes alleviating poverty) met with a world renowned philanthropist who happened to give to her foundation (which also works to alleviate poverty)? Unheard of!Optics has apparently taken over true investigative journalism.So even with these shoddy examples provided by the Associated Press, that didn t stop the other  liberal  outlets like the New York Times from telling Clinton to sever ties with her foundation, and Boston Globe from calling on the foundation to be shutdown outright.And while all this was going on, it was actually discovered that only one candidate running for President of the United States was found to have engaged in an actual pay-for-play scheme with their foundation: Donald Trump.According to reports, Donald Trump s foundation illegally bribed Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi with $25,000 to drop a lawsuit pertaining to Trump University. The IRS fined the Trump foundation $2,500 for the act.Yet can anyone recall hearing about it? Which was blasted more all over the news? The  alleged  pay-for-play from Clinton that is not based on evidence, or the one where the IRS fined Trump for actually engaging in pay-for-play?Did the New York Times call on Trump to shutdown his foundation? Did the Boston Globe call on Trump to sever ties with it? Did anyone, from CNN to Fox News cast any doubt on Trump s unethical (and illegal) behavior of bribing an elected official?No, they did not. Even though the evidence is concrete, mainstream media will still use the word  allegedly  when pertaining to Trump, but will continue to call on Clinton to be investigated even with no evidence.And with that, the New York Times, Associated Press, Boston Globe, and other media elites should apologize to Clinton, denounce Trump, and move on unless any new evidence contradicts Clinton s claims (so far, nothing has).Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 New Poll Leaves Trump Camp Terrified As Even TEXAS Leans Hillary,"A new poll released from the Washington Post and SurveyMonkey has people scratching their heads. For the first time in four months, Donald Trump is leading Hillary Clinton, 46 to 44 percent, while simultaneously losing all swing states and the red states of Texas and Arizona.The poll, which was done from August 9 to September 1, and had close to 75,000 respondents, shows Trump losing Wisconsin, Florida, Colorado, Michigan and Arizona by two points to Clinton, with all of them being within 2 points of each other, 46-44 percent. Texas, the reddest of all red states in the union, was nabbed by Clinton with 1 point over Trump.How is that? People really, really hate Donald Trump:A comparison of the current survey with the 2008 Texas exit poll (there was no exit poll there in 2012) points to reasons the race appears close right now. Trump is performing worse than 2008 GOP nominee John McCain among both whites and Hispanics, while Clinton is doing slightly better than Obama.So in a national poll, Clinton is losing overall. But in all the states that matter (swing) and states never thought possible (Texas), she s winning.Although Trump is leading, the Post (which says the poll actually shows why Clinton has a clear advantage over Trump) has Clinton solidifying 244 electoral votes to Trump s 126 with 168 being tossups. Of those tossups, which includes 10 states, Clinton leads in six, ties with Trump in two, and Trump leads in two.While Trump supporters may be giddy and Clinton supporters worried, the Post actually contends that Trump is the one who should be worried:Overall, the results reflect Trump s strategy of maximizing support in older, whiter Midwestern states where his anti-free-trade message and appeals to national identity generally find more fertile ground. But his struggles elsewhere, including places that have long supported Republicans, illustrate the challenges of that strategy in more diverse states where his stances on immigration and some other positions have turned off Democrats, independents and many Republicans.>To win the election, Trump must quickly consolidate the Republican vote. With prominent Republicans declaring they will not support Trump and some even announcing they will back Clinton, this represents a major challenge for the GOP nominee. In the Post-SurveyMonkey poll, Clinton is winning 90 percent or more of the Democratic vote in 32 states, while Trump is at or above that level in just 13.It s not Hispanic, Latino, Black, or even female voters that are hurting Trump s chances   it s Republicans. The Obama coalition, which delivered two victories to President Obama in 2008 and 2012, have coalesced around Clinton in larger numbers. But now this election has offered something unique: Republicans are starting to come around to Clinton.With Trump losing the traditional coalition and now with Republicans, chances of him overtaking her are slim.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Tamron Hall Tears Top Trump Adviser Apart Piece By Piece,"One of Donald Trump s top advisers repeatedly tried to change the subject during an interview on MSNBC on Monday but Tamron Hall was having none of it.From the Republican nominee s refusal to release his taxes to his illegal donation to Pam Bondi to his immigration policy, Hall grilled A.J. Delgado until she was burned to a crisp.Delgado bragged about 88 retired military veterans endorsing her boss and claimed that it s because Trump is constantly fundraising and donating money to veteran s organizations. Delgado also claimed that Hillary Clinton doesn t have a record of helping veterans.As usual, Trump is slandering Hillary Clinton by lying about what she has done.According to Correct The Record, Hillary Clinton worked tirelessly in the Senate to pass legislation aimed at helping veterans.She introduced the Heroes At Home Act of 2006 and 2007 to help  families care for veterans with traumatic brain injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder. She fought to  increase the survivor benefits for military families from $12,000 to $100,000. In addition, she helped author a new G.I. Bill of Rights and fought to expand retirement and disability as well as family medical leave for veterans as well.Hall pointed out that Trump, on the other hand, hasn t really proved that he donates a lot to veteran s groups because he refuses to release his tax returns.Delgado once again dragged out the tired old excuse that Trump can t release his taxes because he is being audited, but Hall immediately called bullshit. Yes, you can,  Hall said.  There s nothing that prevents you. Delgado, who is supposed a lawyer, argued with Hall by repeatedly saying that he can t until she finally conceded that legally he can release his taxes. But then she tried to make the discussion about Hillary Clinton s health. Why is it you want them released?  Delgado asked.  I think the bigger issue is Hillary Clinton s medical records. Unperturbed, Hall made it clear why American voters have the right to see his taxes. We don t know where he s invested his money. There was a New York Times report about ties to Chinese banks, potential investments in Russia. We need to know more about this presidential candidate. Why not release that information? Frankly, it s time for the IRS to speed up and finish their damn audit so that Trump can no longer use it as an excuse.Hall moved on to slamming Trump for whining about Hillary s ties to foreign leaders and claiming that she ran a  pay-to-play  as Secretary of State. But Hall pointed out that Trump is involved in a real pay-to-play  scandal right now because Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi dropped an investigation into Trump University shortly before Trump donated to her campaign. It sounds like a situation of pay-for-play,  Hall said, prompting yet more whining from Delgado and yet another attempt to pivot to Hillary Clinton. Pam Bondi asked for that donation before she even knew that some complaints had come into her office, hundreds of complaints,  Delgado said, which brings up another question. Why would Bondi kill an investigation even though there were complaints flowing into her office against Trump University? It definitely sounds like Bondi was paid off to drop it.Hall pointed out that if Hillary had donated to Bondi and had a case against her magically dropped that Trump would lose his shit over it. He would say that there s no way Hillary Clinton had this conversation and that this lawsuit did not come up,  Hall said.  Remember all the suspicions regarding [Attorney General Loretta Lynch] and Bill Clinton on the plane? Donald Trump would not accept that as answer. Delgado then tried to portray the IRS fine against Trump for his $25,000 donation as resulting from a  clerical error.  Hall knew that Delgado would keep trying to pivot back to attacking Hillary Clinton and she quickly shut her down. I fully realize that you ve come locked and loaded but what we re going to do is we re going to talk about what your candidate is now saying on the campaign trail 62 days out,  Hall said before playing a clip of Trump flip-flopping on his immigration message.Once again, Delgado was reduced to desperately trying to pivot to Hillary Clinton instead of answering for her boss  clear flip-flop.Here s the video via YouTube.And once again, Tamron Hall proves that she will not take any bullshit from Trump s campaign.Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Warns Putin: Don’t Hack Our Elections,"Recently, intelligence agencies, including the FBI, have found evidence linking Russian state-sponsored hackers as the culprits in multiple breaches of Democratic institutions and state election systems. In what is being seen as tilt-the-election in favor of Republican nominee Donald Trump (due to Democrats being the victim in all the cyber-intrusions), President Obama issued a strong warning to Russian president Vladimir Putin: don t mess with our elections.Although not mentioning the election specifically (as far as we know), President Obama warned Putin that should he start a cyber war with the United States, we would have the upper hand: I will tell you we ve had problems with cyber intrusions from Russia in the past and from other countries in the past. We re moving into a new era here and frankly, we ve got more capacity than anybody both offensively and defensively  What we cannot do is have a situation where this becomes the wild, wild West, where countries that have significant cyber capacity start engaging in unhealthy competition or conflict through these means. President Obama also urged Putin not to duplicate or continue the  cycle of escalation  when it comes to nation s hacking others for personal, political or economic gain.And that s how it s done. Trump, take note.It was reported in the Washington Post on Sunday that American intelligence officials are formally launching an investigation to find out if Russian state-sponsored hackers are planning on a disruption in November s general election:The aim is to understand the scope and intent of the Russian campaign, which incorporates  cyber-tools to hack systems used in the political process, enhancing Russia s ability to spread disinformation  A Russian influence operation in the United States  is something we re looking very closely at,  said one senior intelligence official who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. Officials also are examining potential disruptions to the election process, and the FBI has alerted state and local officials to potential cyberthreats.It s no secret the Russians are pro-Trump, who they see as the perfect puppet for their thugs at the Kremlin. Not only do they see Trump as the way to continue their illegal, coercive and consequential actions, they have actively purchased his campaign with Paul Manafort (before he was forced to resign after it was discovered).Luckily, President Obama has the guts to stand up to Russia and their Gestapo tactics. While Trump folds like an accordion in Mexico, President Obama flexes his muscles.Don t mess with the United States  elections.Featured image via Lintao Zhang/Getty Images",News,"September 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Is Imploding As Greta Van Susteren Leaves Network In Wake Of Settlement With Gretchen Carlson,"An aging audience combined with a devastating sexual harassment lawsuit and the exodus of several high-profile hosts and the resignation of Roger Ailes has all but crippled the conservative propaganda machine in recent months.Fox News has settled with former host Gretchen Carlson for $20 million after she revealed that Ailes had been sexually harassing her for years. Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy was also named by Carlson as a perpetrator but there has been no word as yet on whether he will also get the boot or resign. He probably wouldn t be able to get another job in the media anyway if he did.But soon after Carlson s allegations, Andrea Tantaros slapped the network with a sexual harassment lawsuit of her own, not only naming Ailes but also Bill O Reilly, who allegedly made sexual advances toward Tantaros.That might make it easier for Fox to choose between keeping Megyn Kelly or the longtime host of The O Reilly Factor if reports that the network might have to choose one or the other are true.And now, just after announcing the settlement, longtime host Greta Van Susteren has departed Fox News as well and will be replaced by obnoxious sexist Brit Hume, who once complained that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie can t act like a real man because of feminists and creepily  complimented  Megyn Kelly by marveling about how smart she is despite being pretty.Way to go, Fox. You had a chance to replace Van Susteren with another woman or at least with a male anchor who isn t a misogynist and you failed spectacularly. Replacing her with Hume must mean you didn t learn a damn thing from all the sexual harassment lawsuits being filed against you. We are grateful for Greta s many contributions over the years and wish her continued success,  Fox News said in a brief statement that also included a public apology to Carlson.This is the biggest staff shakeup within Fox News to occur in many years. The sexual harassment bombshell has shattered a working environment that the network cultured for decades and now it is biting them HARD. If Bill O Reilly or Megyn Kelly or both end up jumping ship for calmer waters next year when their contracts expire it could throw the network into even worse chaos.Again, Fox News may have a large audience but their audience is older and that means big trouble for a network that has largely refused to appeal to a millennial audience. Losing Kelly would not help.But considering how many female hosts have left Fox recently and the fact that Fox chose Brit Hume of all people to replace Van Susteren, it appears Kelly could very well decide to leave the toxic anti-women atmosphere of Fox News, which Tantaros described as a media company that  masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny.

" Trump Spokeswoman Slips Up, Says Trump’s Immigration Plan Won’t Work (VIDEO)","We are all getting whiplash from Donald Trump s constant flip-flopping on his immigration policy over the last few weeks. Trump had been touting one of the most racist, heartless and problematic solutions to immigration throughout his entire campaign until just a few weeks ago, when he suddenly walked it back and softened his position. That decision confused everyone   and especially angered his equally racist supporters   and Trump has been stuck in a vicious back-and-forth pattern ever since.Last week, Trump said all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. must leave and then get in line to come back to America. This week, he made another  pivot  in his immigration policy, stating that he hasn t ruled out giving some immigrants a path to legalization. When spokesperson Katrina Pierson went on CNN to try to clear things up, it became apparent that everyone in the Trump campaign is confused now.In trying to defend her boss, a struggling Pierson said that it would be impossible for Trump to deport all the undocumented immigrants in America because there could be 2-3 times more immigrants than what the estimates say. Using the usual imaginary statistics that the Trump campaign has become infamous for, she said: We are continuously hearing that there s not 11 million [undocumented immigrants], there could be 20 million, there could be 30 million. This is important because Mr. Trump can t promise to deport every single illegal alien in the country if there s 30 million. While she was speaking, the host noticed that Pierson was absolutely lost and said,  We understand that it s complicated    which only infuriated Pierson and made her raise her voice. But as hard as she tried, Pierson couldn t give any solid reasoning for why Trump s ever-changing policy could work, because the truth is that it won t. The only thing that was cleared up in this interview was the fact that not even Trump s own campaign can keep up with his policy changes.Watch Pierson stumble through this interview below:.@KatrinaPierson on Trump s changing immigration stance: He said from beginning he d be  a negotiator in Congress  https://t.co/G4qVqhxleN  New Day (@NewDay) September 6, 2016Featured image is a screenshot",News,"September 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 What Trump Just Said About His Tax Returns Will Make His Supporters FURIOUS (VIDEO),"It s hard to imagine that Donald Trump could give America any more reasons why he shouldn t be the country s next president, but Trump just can t help it. When he s not offending minorities or destroying our relations with our countries, Trump is coming up with more shady excuses about why he can t release his tax returns, even after his own vice president, Mike Pence, said that they would both be releasing their tax documents.However, in a joint interview yesterday, Trump and his running mate seemed to be changing their story once again. Ignoring the fact that everyone from Hillary Clinton to prominent Republicans to even his own supporters have begged the business mogul to release his tax returns, Trump had the nerve to tell ABC News  David Muir that no one cares about his tax returns. He said: I think people don t care. I don t think anybody cares, except some members of the press. And not surprisingly, Pence slightly walked back his comment about Trump releasing his tax returns (he must have gotten yelled at by his boss) and told Muir that he d meant only after they were audited, and that  this is all a distraction. Once again, Trump gave the ongoing audit of his taxes as an excuse, despite the fact that parts of Trump s audit have been completed and the IRS has said Trump could release them. Not to mention, many former presidential candidates have released their tax documents while under audit   it s not a big deal, unless you have something to hide.Bragging that he s given  most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics , Trump continued: When the audit is done, I ll release them. I don t know when that s gonna be, it could be soon, it could be not. How comforting. So much for the transparency and trustworthiness he s trying to build with American voters.

" Finally Asked About Bribery Scandal, Trump Immediately Gets Caught In A Lie","For a long time now, the mainstream media has avoided questioning Donald Trump about the questionable relationship between a donation he made to the Attorney General in Florida and her decision to give his allegedly fraudulent Trump University a pass. After progressives complained about the issue on social media, the press has finally begun asking Trump about the details of his gift to Pam Bondi, which was recently flagged as a violation of the law by the IRS, resulting in a fine.Asked about the cash gift and the later favor delivered by Bondi, Trump immediately got caught in an inconvenient lie. I never spoke to her, first of all. She s a fine person, beyond reproach. I never even spoke to her about it at all. She s a fine person. Never spoken to her about it, never,  Trump said Monday while campaigning in Ohio.  Many of the attorney generals turned that case down because I ll win that case in court. Many turned that down. I never spoke to her. Marc Reichelderfer   who worked as a consultant on Bondi s reelection effort   told the Associated Press in June that Bondi spoke with Trump and solicited the donation herself. Reichelderfer said that Bondi had not been aware of the complaints against Trump University when she asked for the contribution.Trump doesn t have to have spoken with Bondi about his donation to her for it to be clear evidence of a  pay for play  scandal, but it is telling that as usual his first, off the cuff remark about Bondi turns out to have been false.Trump also made a donation to the attorney general in Texas, who then dropped a probe of Trump University, and it is unknown how many other government officials got nice checks from Trump before they made decisions about his business interests.But we do know that his first instinct was to tell an easily provable lie.Featured image via YouTube",News,"September 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Reveals The ONE THING To Stop Him From Debating Hillary And It’s RIDICULOUS (VIDEO),"On Monday, Donald Trump gave interviews to reporters on his plane, and naturally the subject of the presidential debates against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton came up. As expected, Trump s responses were nothing short of moronic and unbelievable, and show just how unprepared Trump is to be president.As reporters threw different questions at Trump about his strategy to beat Clinton, Trump gave responses that should have his supporters worried sick about how he s going to win. Trump told reporters that he is barely doing any debate prep   in stark contrast to most presidential candidates. With a dismissive attitude, the ignorant business mogul revealed that he has not planned on mock debates, saying he d pretty much rather wing it: I ve seen people do so much prep work when they get out there, they can t speak. I ve seen that. Then when Trump was asked if he d actually follow through with the debates, Trump gave an even more surprising answer.Trump said,  As of this moment, yeah    a strange response for sure. And then he said that only hurricanes and natural disasters  would stop him from debating the former Secretary of State. He said: I expect to do all three. I look forward to the debates. You can watch this bizarre interview below:Hilariously, Trump also said that it was his  obligation  to debate Clinton and that presidential debates are an  important element of what we re doing.  He said: I did them with the other, you know, the other cases. We had, I guess 11 debates. Obviously, I did well in the debates. Obviously, according to the polls, the online polls they did right after the debates. And I think I m doing the same thing. Trump must have forgotten that he actually skipped one of the GOP debates, and also backed out of the debate that he challenged Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to. And there are ongoing rumors that Trump is going to somehow find an excuse to back out of his debates with Clinton as well. Judging from this interview alone, we would not be surprised.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"September 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Hillary Just Gave Us The BEST Comeback Ever To All The Allegations That She’s Sick,"The Trump campaign and the conservative media have been having a field day with Hillary s health. The idea that she s in really bad health is an absolutely asinine theory that s gotten to the point where some are circulating fake medical documents, while others, like Martin  Pharma Bro  Shkreli (who isn t anything like a doctor) are diagnosing her with things like Parkinson s.During a very recent stump speech, she stopped to cough. Knowing that conservatives were going to pounce on her again for that, she said: Every time I think about Trump I get allergic. She s allergic to Donald Trump! (Aren t we all?) This made the audience roar, and it s made others laugh, too. It s not difficult to be allergic to Trump   his speeches are really nothing more than giant fountains of toxic waste. Toxic waste contains all kinds of things that cause serious health conditions, so it s not too far a stretch to think it also triggers allergic reactions. Since symptoms of allergies can include coughing, this is a totally, utterly, completely perfect comeback.Watch that segment of her speech below:The Trump campaign, of course, doesn t think it s so funny. Kellyanne Conway, Trump s campaign manager, seized on Hillary s comeback on Twitter (she s very unhappy about this):Must be allergic to media. Finally spent a minute w/ them. Hillary Has A Nearly 2 Minute Long Coughing Fit [VIDEO] https://t.co/G0rKPfAjmr  Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) September 5, 2016The speculation about Hillary s health actually started two years ago with former chief Republican dunce Karl Rove. Rove wanted to know what was up with Hillary being hospitalized for a concussion, and then reappearing with these glasses people wear when they ve got traumatic brain injuries.  We need to know what s up with that,  he said.Newsflash to Rove and others who are harping on her for seemingly trying to hide a traumatic brain injury: A concussion is a traumatic brain injury.But that s neither here nor there.From that point on, conservatives who hate her, and Trump s campaign, have seized on all manner of things that supposedly  prove  she s too sick to serve as president. She s not too sick. She s just allergic to Trump, like most of the rest of the sane world.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sanders Slams Trump On Campaign Trail: ‘The Essence Of His Campaign Is Bigotry’,"Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders hit the campaign trail for his former opponent in the Democratic primary on Monday, and he didn t mince words when it came to Republican nominee Donald Trump. As we all know, Trump has run one of the ugliest, most bigoted campaigns we ve seen this side of the Civil Rights Era. To that end, Bernie wasn t just there to stump for Hillary, but also to make sure his audience understands just who Donald Trump is, and what he stands for. Bernie began: My opposition to Trump goes beyond the fact that he refuses to recognize the reality of climate change. It goes beyond his willingness to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut programs for working people. My opposition in the strongest way to Trump is that he is making the cornerstone of his campaign, not economics, not healthcare, not the environment   the essence of his campaign is bigotry. Bernie didn t stop there, though, and continued the all -out assault on Trump from his platform on the stage in Lebanon, New Hampshire: We re supposed to hate anybody who is different than we are. He went on to remind everyone of Trump s outrageous statements regarding Muslims, women, Mexicans, and other groups. After all, lest we forget, Trump actually kicked his campaign off by calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. After that, he called for, quote,  a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. Of course, we all know that Trump has spent the last year and a half appealing to the most disgusting and dark elements of the underbelly of racist American populism. He has brought overt racism and fringe white supremacy mainstream   so much so, in fact, that he has inspired former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke to run for the U.S. Senate.So, GOP, remember all of these FACTS next time you try to tell minorities that your party isn t bigoted. With Trump as your standard   bearer, how the hell can you expect us to believe that?Good on you, Bernie, for calling a spade a spade, and reminding the American people just who and what Donald Trump and his disgusting campaign really is.Featured image via Darren McCollester/Getty Images",News,"September 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Continues Racist Birtherism, Won’t Say President Obama Is An American","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s first entrance to prominence in mainstream American politics was built on the same thing his entire horrific campaign has been built on: bigotry. Specifically, bigotry against America s first black president, Barack Obama. Trump led the racist charge that would come to be known as the  birther  movement, where he and his racist followers claimed that President Obama is not a Christian American who was born in Hawaii, but was instead a Muslim born in Kenya.Of course, these wild claims have been debunked over and over again during Obama s tenure as President, but that still has not convinced The Donald. In fact, to this day, Trump refuses to admit that he was wrong, and that indeed President Obama was born right here in the United States of America. On Monday, Trump was asked if his views had changed on President Obama s place of birth, and all he would say to reporters is,  I don t talk about it. Well, Mr. Trump, you spent months upon months publicly worrying over the President s birth certificate, ginning up racism from your fellow bigots who couldn t stand that there s a Black family living in the White House, and no matter what President Obama did   including releasing his long form birth certificate as you requested   nothing was good enough for you.There s a reason for this. It s not about any sort of legitimate question regarding President Obama s origins, but about pure, unabashed racism. And here you are, a few years later, as the standard   bearer for one of America s major political parties, and you still are peddling this racist conspiracy theory in an effort to damage President Obama s legacy and deligitimize his time in the office of the presidency.Shame on you, Donald Trump. And, more to the point, shame on the Republican Party for allowing this man to carry your banner, and then claim that you don t tolerate and endorse racism. Clearly, you do.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump-Supporting Republican Candidate Wishes Rape Upon Female Reporter,"This is the kind of trash Donald Trump is bringing into the political field.When Daily Beast reporter Olivia Nuzzi posted a story on her Facebook page about the relationship between Donald Trump and Marla Maples written by colleague Brandy Zadrozny, she didn t think it would cause conservatives to lose their shit.After all, the piece seems to reveal a Trump with a more human side, while expressing admiration for Marla Maples for the way she put up with his bullshit all those years. Regardless, there is no excuse for this kind of response.Nevertheless, a New Jersey Republican who clearly has not read the piece nor understood that Nuzzi did not write the story herself lashed out by openly replying that he hopes somebody rapes her, preferably a Syrian refugee. I hope somebody rapes you today,  wrote Mike Krawitz, a GOP candidate running for a seat on the West Deptford Township CommitteeThis man who wants me to be raped today was a Republican candidate for office in NJ https://t.co/NgxtjOTaJ9 pic.twitter.com/H31Q5VmXVc  Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) September 5, 2016Here s an image of his posts as they appeared on Facebook.So far, the West Deptford GOP is failing horribly at handling the matter. They are actually defending Krawitz by claiming that his Twitter account got hacked. The executive board of the WDGOP does not condone any repulsive, threatening, or demeaning rhetoric in any social media form or otherwise,  they began.  We are in the process of contacting Twitter for confirmation that someone hacked his account and posted his facebook thumbnail on the hacked twitter entry. Except that Krawitz, who is an avid fan of the Republican nominee, posted his disgusting attack on Facebook, something Nuzzi reminded the West Deptford GOP when she took them to the woodshed over their pathetic response.Wishing rape upon any woman is despicable and should automatically disqualify the person who said it from seeking political office. But apparently, the GOP thinks it s a virtue.Featured image via Facebook",News,"September 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Defends Kaepernick’s Protest And Racist Conservatives Lose Their Sh*t,"Conservatives are throwing a collective hissy fit because President Obama defended Colin Kaepernick s constitutional right to protest by not standing for the National Anthem.The San Francisco 49ers quarterback has been sitting during the National Anthem in protest of the police brutality and inequality black people have been facing for years. Conservatives have been bashing Kaepernick ever since, questioning his patriotism and telling him to leave the country but now he has his strongest ally yet.On Monday, President Obama, who taught constitutional law for twelve years, confirmed that Kaepernick does indeed have the right to sit during the National Anthem if he so chooses. My understanding at least is that he s exercising his constitutional right to make a statement,  President Obama told reporters during his trip to China.  I think there s a long history of sports figures doing so. Indeed, Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson are just two of the African-American sports heroes who were doing this kind of protest long before Kaepernick came along. But I don t doubt his sincerity based on what I ve heard,  Obama continued.  I think he cares about some real legitimate issues that have to be talked about. If nothing else what he s done is he s generated more conversation around some topics that need to be talked about. Here s the video via YouTube.But conservatives, as usual, responded to President Obama by letting their racism fly.@FoxNews @POTUS @Kaepernick7 Of course he would side with an anti-American mulatto.

President Obama also acknowledged that some veterans feel disrespected by it and said there are other ways to protest.But African-Americans have tried several ways to protest police brutality and inequality, and so far, conservatives have found any reason to whine no matter what just like they do about anything President Obama says or does.Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bin Laden’s Brother Lived In Trump Tower, Gave Millions To The Donald","Back in June, on Facebook, Donald Trump called on Hillary Clinton to return millions of dollars the Clinton Foundation received in donations from Saudi Arabia: Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate. I am calling on her to immediately return the $25 million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation! For months now the right has used the Saudi donations as definitive  proof  that Clinton is beholden to oppressive regimes, and isn t serious about protecting women s rights and LGBT rights.But while the right is hailing their newfound champion of women s rights and gay rights, maybe they should take a look at how much money he s taken from the Saudi government   personally   and how he allowed Osama Bin Laden s brother to live in the famous Trump Tower.Had Hillary Clinton allowed a Bin Laden such private access, the right wing media would have a field day. But since it s Donald Trump, he gets a free pass.According to a new expos  by The Daily News, Trump has received over $5.7 million dollars from the Saudi government after selling  sold the 45th floor of Trump World Tower to the Kingdom. Since 2001, the government has had to pay the Trump Organization $85,585 for building amenities a year.Before the payoff of real estate, Trump also allowed Osama Bin Laden s half-brother, Shafiq Bin Laden, to live in the apartment for four months in 1986.Perhaps Trump can follow his own example and can go ahead and give the $5.7 million back to the Saudi government, and explain why he allowed the brother of the world s most dangerous and wanted terrorist to live at his crowning achievement.How is Trump going to hold the Saudi government accountable when they have direct ownership in his business? Trump has already hinted that he would not step down from the Trump organization, raising high levels of potential conflicts of interest for the United States government.But let s keep pretending Hillary Clinton hasn t done anything for women and LGBT people because Donald Trump has such a great track record when it comes to equality.Featured image via Joe Freso/Getty Images",News,"September 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 U.S. Women’s Soccer Star Megan Rapinoe Kneels During National Anthem To Support Kaepernick,"The protest is growing.Most people don t seem to understand that freedom and liberty is a two-way street. That when soldiers fight and die for our rights they did so for all of them.At least that s what conservatives don t understand since they ve been critical almost to the point of calling for violence against San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for not standing during the national anthem in protest of police brutality. I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,  Kaepernick told the press following a game last month.  To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. Kaepernick has been joined in his protest by other athletes, but now he has the support of one of the biggest stars in women s soccer.Megan Rapinoe plays on the United States national women s team on the world stage, including the Olympic games. And on Sunday, she became the highest-profile white athlete to protest inequality in America by refusing to stand for the national anthem.When the anthem began playing Rapinoe simply took a knee, and her action brought even more attention to the issues Kaepernick is raising. It was a little nod to Kaepernick and everything that he s standing for right now,  Rapinoe told the media.  I think it s actually pretty disgusting the way he was treated and the way that a lot of the media has covered it and made it about something that it absolutely isn t. We need to have a more thoughtful, two-sided conversation about racial issues in this country. IN addition to racial issues, Rapinoe s kneel also drew attention to LGBT issues such as discrimination. Being a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties. It was something small that I could do and something that I plan to keep doing in the future and hopefully spark some meaningful conversation around it. It s important to have white people stand in support of people of color on this. We don t need to be the leading voice, of course, but standing in support of them is something that s really powerful. If the American flag really stands for  liberty and justice for all  we wouldn t be seeing police officers unjustly killing black people in the streets and we wouldn t see conservatives constantly trying to pass new laws in order to legalize discrimination against gay people.But we ARE seeing these injustices take place and until they are fixed perhaps it s time we shelve the national anthem until the flag has earned back its respect.Featured image via Twitter",News,"September 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama Shows Why Trump Is Too Much Of A Hothead To Be President,"Donald Trump has constantly involved himself in one silly feud after another, going ballistic on a series of individuals and institutions in a childish tantrum style, often about topics that have absolutely nothing to do with being elected president.Trump has done this so often, Hillary Clinton referenced the behavior in her speech accepting the Democratic nomination in Philadelphia this summer, noting,  Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. The current occupant of the White House, President Obama, recently showed off the stark difference in temperament between himself and someone like Trump in how he responded to poor treatment by Chinese authorities.The Chinese prevented a set of stairs from being used to allow Obama to walk off of Air Force One, forcing the White House to eventually scrap the process even though it is a key element in the imagery of the President arriving for a diplomatic event like the G20. Obama could have chosen to complain and whine and moan about it. Instead Mr. Obama played down the incident, saying it was part of the normal give-and-take over security and media access that the United States has with many foreign countries.He noted that foreign delegations often feel bruised by their treatment when they visit the United States. And he acknowledged that the White House places a lot of demands on countries he visits because of the size of his entourage and his security demands.Can you imagine Donald Trump letting a violation of protocol or   more importantly in his egocentric eyes   allowing an opportunity for a photo-op to pass him by? No doubt a raft of Chinese officials, including the stair operator, would be subject to aggressive Trump tweets. He might even come up with one of his childish nicknames.Instead, Obama let it slide, going on to sign a major agreement with the Chinese president in order to fight global climate change   a real problem, not an optics one.That s a big difference.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Twitter DESTROYS Trump For Irony Of Screaming About The ‘C’ Marking On Hillary’s Emails,"Break out the popcorn   Donald Trump got busy bashing Hillary Clinton on his Twitter account over her emails. Again. Because Trump can only do two things on Twitter: Praise himself while pretending to thank his audiences, and bash anybody he doesn t like. One particular tweet stands out, though, particularly for its irony:Lyin  Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the  C  markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2016The irony is that, back in the  70s, Trump Management marked lease applications from black people with the letter  c  to indicate that they were black, and therefore, not to be rented to. That s what s getting Twitter in an uproar over this.Trump Management claimed they never discriminated and they never would when the Department of Justice sued them over this. Our dear Donald, at the time, swore that he didn t have direct knowledge of what was going on. He flat-out said,  I don t care and I don t know. Twitter is having a field day with him over this, as well they should. If he s going to rag on Hillary for not knowing that  c  stands for, then he can jolly well admit that Trump Management was racist enough to mark applications with a  c  themselves so they would know who they should not rent to. @realDonaldTrump the C making on your tenancy applications meant  colored  though, right Donald?

In his blog post about Trump s ridiculous attack on Flake, he fleshes out some of his tweets a little better: But Donald Trump is a weak, fragile, and petulant man who cannot stomach dissent or criticism.

 WATCH: Chuck Todd Blasts Pence For Trump’s Hiring Of Alleged Rapists And Racists,"Donald Trump s campaign currently has a leadership that is under fire for more than a few scandals. On Sunday, Chuck Todd blasted Trump s running mate Mike Pence for hiring both Steve Bannon of Breitbart, a right-wing reactionary media site, and Roger Ailes of Fox News. Bannon is facing allegations of anti-Semitism and Ailes for  sexually harassing what now seems like every woman who ever stepped foot in his office: Quick question about the leadership of the campaign, there s been some troubling allegations both against Steve Bannon, somethings he may have said about Jewish people, some things that may have happened between him and his wife, Todd said during a broadcast of Meet the Press.  There s been troubling allegations having to do with Roger Ailes. Both of whom are apparently advisers to this campaign. Are you comfortable with that considering some of the allegations you ve read against both of these men? Are you comfortable with their involvement in this campaign? I promise you the person leading Donald Trump s campaign is Donald Trump,  Pence responds.  He and I talk every day, sometimes several times a day. He is   he is a hands on leader and a hands on CEO. Todd then goes on to question Pence further, asking him it is,  appropriate for Roger Ailes to be involved? I trust Donald Trump s judgment to assemble around this team a group that s going to help us move forward and be successful and win,  Pence says.  And come on, I mean, Steve Bannon has denied all of those allegations    Todd then interjects to say,  Some are in court records. I mean, look, I know   look, divorces are divorces. But it s troubling allegations, people are going to look and say, all right, Steve Bannon and then you see all these allegations against Roger Ailes, it just feels as if there s   does he ignore troubling allegations against people that work for him? I trust Donald Trump to assemble a team around him in this campaign has he has and will continue to. You ll continue to see people added to this campaign,  Pence says.Pence s claim that we ll see more people added to his campaign staff has me wondering who Trump will hire next. Martin Shkreli seems like he would fit in with the rest of Trump s campaign compadres. At this point, it wouldn t even be shocking to see Trump hire George Zimmerman to spearhead his outreach efforts to voters of color.What Todd doesn t go into is the fact that a presidential candidate has officially aligned himself with two major players in the media. While Ailes may have resigned as the chairman and CEO of Fox News due to his inability to give women in his employment their basic human rights, he still remains on of the most powerful men in the news industry. So powerful in fact, that Rupert Murdoch has gone on record as saying that Ailes is responsible for the success of Trump s campaign thus far.  Then there is Bannon, who is on a  temporary  leave from his position as the CEO of Breitbart, a staple site in propagating bizarre right-wing conspiracies and white supremacist narratives.What this amounts to is the collusion two of the largest private dispensers of information in the world working with a fascist billionaire to try and take control of the wealthiest and most influential nation in the world. This current situation should serve as a warning to the entire left-wing that in the era of neoliberalist domination, corporations have the power to  convince millions of people to vote for an administration that would rather turn the United States into sacrifice zone, rather than lose a profit.You can watch the clip below:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"September 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Soledad O’Brien SLAMS Media For Supporting White Supremacy (VIDEO),"On Sunday, former CNN host Soledad O Brien appeared on CNN s Reliable Sources, where she claimed that CNN and the mainstream media in general, have helped Donald Trump normalize white supremacy through their coverage of his campaign. If you look at Hillary Clinton s speech where she basically pointed out that what Donald Trump has done   actually quite well   has normalized white supremacy. I think she made a very good argument, almost like a lawyer. Here are ways in which he has actually worked to normalize conversations that many people find hateful.I ve seen on-air, white supremacists being interviewed because they are Trump delegates, and they do a five-minute segment, the first minute or so talking about what they believe as white supremacists. So you have normalized that. O Brien continued to voice her objections to the type of coverage the press has given Trump over the course of his campaign run, saying: Donald Trump will say,  Hillary Clinton, she s a bigot.  And it s covered, the journalist part comes in,  They trade barbs. He said she s a bigot and she points out that he might be appealing to racists.  It only becomes  he said, she said.  When in actuality, the fact that Donald Trump said she s a bigot without the long laundry list of evidence, which if you looked at Hillary Clinton s speech, she actually did have a lot of really good factual evidence that we would all agree that are things that have happened and do exist. They are treated as if they are equal. O Brien is voicing critiques of the media that have come up recently regarding the way media organizations handle their bias towards objectivity. Similar criticisms of mainstream media companies have arisen in the past over a wide variety of issues   most notably, when covering issues relating to climate change. For example, in an effort to appear objective, news and editorial shows will have a climate scientist come on their program as well as a climate change denier.It isn t at all fair to have a climate change denier be given airtime when they represent an incredibly small fraction of the population of experts. Especially when you take into consideration that their views are generally considered to be demonstrably false by all available scientific evidence.The same goes for Trump and those involved with his campaign. They represent an overall tiny segment of population   keep in mind that less than 10% of the eligible U.S. population voted for any candidate in the presidential primary   and they generally have put out views that are hateful and even bizarre.You can watch the video of the exchange below:Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"September 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Team Trump Can’t Get Their Immigration Message Straight, So Hillary Does It For Them","Donald Trump s signature issue since he began his travesty of a presidential campaign has been immigration. He won the primary by promising a bunch of ignorant, anti-immigrant, racist, and otherwise bigoted voters in the GOP base that he d deport all the brown people and build a giant wall to keep more of them from coming in. Well, that was the primary, and this is general election. He and his campaign staff seem to have realized that they can t win with just a bunch of racists, so they are attempting to moderate that hardline message, but they have to be careful, because the base still has to be fed that red meat that got them onto Team Trump in the first place.The result of this attempted balancing act has been a muddying of the water amongst Trump s campaign staff and surrogates as they chase their tails all over television with no clear message regarding what will happen to all of the undocumented immigrants who are already here and contributing to American society. In fact, on Sunday s edition of MSNBC s Meet the Press, this was a topic of conversation, and one panel member pretty much summed up the issue here: Trump himself doesn t know what the hell his own plan is on his signature issue. I don t know if Donald Trump knows what he is going to do with them [illegal immigrants]   @TheFix on #MTP Panel  Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) September 4, 2016Moderator Chuck Todd also interviewed Trump s running mate Mike Pence, and his answers weren t anymore satisfying. Pence only returned to the false narrative that Trump s positions on this issue are  consistent. Pence on #MTP: ""I think Donald Trump has been completely consistent"" on deportation policy.https://t.co/Q3m39LDyQy  Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) September 4, 2016Well, since the American people deserve to know where a major party presidential candidate stands on such an important issue this far along in the election season, Hillary s campaign manager Robby Mook decided to help us all out. He released a statement via the Hillary For America website that reads: Donald Trump has stated very clearly throughout his campaign that he will deport everyone who is undocumented, something that was reinforced in his speech in Arizona last Wednesday. Beyond forcibly removing every single undocumented person from this country, Trump has also promised to rescind DACA and DAPA, and deport American citizens who are born to undocumented immigrant parents. What we saw today is Mike Pence and Trump s top campaign officials attempt to mislead voters about their mass deportation policy by using soft words to describe harsh tactics   one of the oldest tricks in the book. Immigrant families know the meanings of  humane  and  fair  and can see straight through their cynical ploys. Trump s message to immigrant families is clear: everyone must go. This, of course, is the bottom line: the Trump campaign wishes to muddy the waters, to make us all think he doesn t plan on erecting a deportation force to make all the brown people leave, so that we ll think he actually has some compassion for these people. Nothing could be further from the truth. It doesn t matter to Trump if you re a 70-year-old woman who fled her home country 40 years ago to escape war or violence, if it was either enter the country illegally or face certain death   Trump will deport you, and take you away from your documented children and grandchildren.That s the kind of cold, cruel, callous approach that Donald Trump and his racist cronies have when it comes to this very complex and sensitive issue, make no mistake. They re just using different words now, but they mean exactly what has been said for the last 14 months   immigrants are the enemy, and they will be thrown out.Thankfully, though, Hillary and her team have read the message loud and clear, and are making sure the American people understand just what that very scary message is.Featured image via Instagram",News,"September 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" ‘We See Only One Viable Leader’: Nonpartisan Generals Break Tradition, Endorse Hillary (VIDEO)","Two previously nonpartisan generals have broken a decades-long tradition of keeping their votes private, in what is likely to be yet another nail in the GOP s coffin this election cycle. TIME magazine reports:Two four-star generals, Bob Sennewald, former commanding general of the U.S. Army Forces Command and David Maddox, former commander in chief of the U.S. Army-Europe, announced their endorsement on Thursday. Our votes have always been private, and neither of us has ever previously lent his name or voice to a presidential candidate,  they said in a joint statement.  Having studied what is at stake for this country and the alternatives we have now, we see only one viable leader, and will be voting this November for Secretary Hillary Clinton. This is a victory for Hillary, as both campaigns focus on courting the military vote. American Legion, the largest veterans organization in the United States, held their convention last week. Both candidates gave speeches and pandered as best as they could (Trump s speech had some creepy fascist undertones), but with key differences: Supporters of Trump praised his  forcefulness  and  presence,  whereas Hillary supporters applauded her for actual plans and substance.This actually serves very well as an example to illustrate the primary differences between the candidates as a whole. And while Trump likely enjoys a massive lead among most active-duty troops, that pattern does not hold true everywhere   intelligence officials, national security advisers, and military leadership all seem to favor Hillary.The reason is simple: Trump is not competent. There is emotional appeal in his charisma and presence that apparently strikes a chord with some people, but for the half of the nation that prefers thought before action, it s simply not enough. Hillary has the experience, knowledge, and basic competency to get the job done, which Trump entirely lacks. For strategic thinkers worried about the future of our nation, the choice could not be any more clear.Here s the entirety of Hillary s speech to the American Legion, courtesy of PBS:Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images",News,"September 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Trump Surrogate Tries To Spin Taco Truck Fiasco, Gets Laughed At (VIDEO)","On Sunday, during a panel segment on CNN s State of the Union, former MTV Real World reality TV star and Trump surrogate Rachel Campos-Duffy, tried her best to spin the recent #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner mega-gaffe. Her efforts received laughter from the other panelists, with Clinton surrogate Bakari Sellers remarking that they had  never seen spin like that. In case you missed it, Latinos for Trump founder Marco Gutierrez warned that if we did not do something to stop illegal immigration and elect Hillary Clinton we will have taco trucks on every corner.Here s how Campos-Duffy tried to spin the narrative: What I think is really interesting is that taco trucks really are the ultimate symbol of American entrepreneurial capitalism. And I think what people want to know is not what some first-time surrogate fumbled, what they want to know about is who is going to help people who want to start taco trucks. Campos-Duffy then went on to say: And liberal policies have always over-regulated food trucks. What people want to know is who is going to help people start businesses, let them grow, become financially independent. Liberals over-regulate these kinds of small business owners and conservatives help them achieve their dreams. Excellent pivot,  Jake Tapper remarked.Trump surrogate Andre Bauer was, believe it or not, quite fond of the analogy. Those are people that are business owners, they re working hard. We just don t want the people here that are stealing the hubcaps. Which, as Tapper pointed out was not at all what Gutierrez meant when he made the gaffe.You can watch the segment below.

 WATCH: Pipeline Company Attacks Indigenous Protesters With Dogs And Pepper Spray,"On Saturday, dozens of indigenous people were attacked by private security while protesting the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. The Associated Press reports that at least 30 people were pepper-sprayed and six people had been bitten by dogs, including one child. There were no police officers on site.The protestors broke through fencing and rushed towards construction crews, though none of them appear to have been acting violently. The construction crew was using bulldozers to remove top soil from the site of an ancient indigenous burial ground.Standing Rock Sioux chairman David Archambault II said in a statement that: This demolition is devastating. These grounds are the resting places of our ancestors. The ancient cairns and stone prayer rings there cannot be replaced. In one day, our sacred land has been turned into hollow ground. Democracy Now! was on the ground at the time of the attack. Here are photos and video footage that shows the damage that was done to protestors.VIDEO Dakota Access Pipeline Co Attacks Native American Protesters with Dogs & Pepper Spray https://t.co/opaGFmyLxj pic.twitter.com/uXfFAxKkej  Democracy Now! (@democracynow) September 4, 2016This is just the latest incident to happen in a protest that has gone on for months. The Dakota Access pipeline once constructed would span four states. From an environmentalist s standpoint or anyone who is at least mildly concerned with combating climate change    we should be thankful that the demonstrations are taking place.  The pipeline is expected to transport 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day from the Bakken region in North Dakota to Illinois.Despite being sold to the public as a means of securing energy independence, The Intercept recently revealed that at least some of the oil transported by the pipeline will be exported. How much exactly will be exported is unknown. However, recent changes in oil and gas export laws, as well as changes in the oil and gas market, have created conditions that make it far more profitable to export oil than to sell it domestically.Featured image via Twitter",News,"September 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Campaign Manager Crashes And Burns When Grilled About Immigration Plan,"ABC host Martha Raddatz proved once again why she is one of the best choices to be a Presidential Debate moderator on Sunday, when she grilled Kellyanne Conway about the Republican nominee s immigration plan.After Trump s campaign manager talked about how Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine supposedly don t answer questions correctly because they make it about Trump and are not  forthcoming,  Raddatz asked Conway to clear up some questions about Trump s plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, which she proceeded to answer by not really answering it. He said that the priority will be criminals and those who have overstayed their visas. That still amounts to between 5 million and 6.5 million people that he says will be quickly removed. The cost estimate for that is between $51 billion and $67 billion. How will he manage such a massive operation and who will pay for it? Conway replied by putting the onus on ICE officers and once again said Trump will build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, completely avoiding answering for how Trump intends to pay for such a costly plan. He ll manage it the way it should have been managed all along, by enforcing the law and relying upon those law enforcement officers and those ICE officers to do their job,  Conway said.  They ve been completely hamstrung in their ability to do their job. He also has   said that he will triple the number of ICE agents to try to help. Conway then did exactly what she whined about Kaine and Clinton supposedly doing by pivoting to talking about how they don t have an immigration plan.Except Hillary Clinton DOES have an immigration plan and you can find it on her website here.Raddatz then steered Conway back to Trump s plan. Back to immigration, he said there will be no amnesty; all immigrants here illegally will be subject to deportation,  Raddatz said.  So will they be subject to deportation and removal? This is where Conway really began to wither because Republican logic dictates that all undocumented immigrants are criminals, which means all 11 million would have to be deported. But Conway tried to have it both ways. If they re criminals, they re going immediately. And we don t know what that number is. We hear anything from 1 million to 2 million,  Conway replied.  And then, of course, he has also said, this being the most generous country to immigrants in the world, that if you want to come to America and immigrate here legally  Raddatz s bullshit detector went off and she once again tried to pin Conway to the wall by asking her point blank that if these immigrants have not committed a crime in the United States will Trump still deport them. Well, Conway couldn t handle that question either. He has said that you should stand in line and immigrate legally,  Conway said before Raddatz cut her off again.  So you mean they have to go?  Raddatz asked.Conway once again could not handle the question and made a series of gaffes in response. She once again falsely claimed that Hillary Clinton does not have an immigration plan while Trump has a  ten-point plan.  For the record, Hillary s plan is a nine-point plan and it is posted on her campaign website.Conway also said that Trump plans to  rescind all those executive amnesties.  So does that mean Trump will rescind any executive order that has ever granted amnesty to immigrants, including those issued by presidents that came before President Obama? Because that would be very worrying if that s the case as Trump s immigration plan could then affect millions and millions more people.Raddatz finally realized that Conway was not going to be forthcoming in her answers and proceeded to slam her for it.Here s the video via YouTube.This is why Martha Raddatz is considered one of the toughest interviewers in the media. She took Conway to the cleaners and made her look like the hypocrite and fool that she is. Donald trump s plan would be costly, not to mention an international incident between Mexico and the United States since you have to wonder how Trump will actually force Mexico to pay for something it has repeatedly refused to pay for.And the fact that Conway is literally lying about Hillary Clinton by claiming that she doesn t have a plan is equally infuriating. If there s one claim Raddatz should have challenged Conway on it s that one. Other than that, Conway crashed and burned because Raddatz is a pro, which should be making Trump very nervous since he will have to face her later this year when she moderates a debate.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Liberal Nobel Prize Winning Economist: Hillary Clinton Is MORE Liberal Than Obama,"Over the last decade or so, a handful of people have become what you might call economic rock stars, at least for liberals. Robert Reich, Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz grab the attention of liberals when they talk about income inequality, taking corporate influence out of politics and a more equitable tax structure.Bernie Sanders had talked about bringing on Stiglitz and Reich, if he were to win the presidency. In other words, these are men who have all the credibility in the world when it comes to evaluating political candidates and Nobel Prize winning economist Stiglitz believes that if Clinton wins, we are in for an even more liberal agenda than Obama has had.To be fair, Stiglitz is an advisor to Clinton s campaign, but he rarely tones down his progressive rhetoric, no matter who he s talking to or about. With Clinton, though, he gets quite specific in an interview with Slate Magazine. Stiglitz believes that in the years since Bill Clinton left office, the country has changed and that we are far more focused on income inequality, something he believes Hillary Clinton will do something about:Where do you situate Hillary Clinton ideologically in terms of economics?I think that s a good question. I think the world today is different from where it was 20 years ago, and the issues are being framed considerably differently. For instance, I think there s a recognition that inequality is a much bigger problem. I think she is much more concerned about more progressive taxes and dealing with tax avoidance of multinational corporations. I think she is very committed to that. I think progressives are not against trade, but they are concerned with trade agreements that are pushed by corporations, for their interests, by and for corporations. That is what we have in the form of TPP. I think it is a good thing that she has come out against that.Stiglitz also believes that the very fact that Clinton is pragmatic   something she s often criticized for on the left   will keep he on the right track:One of the progressive concerns about Clinton has been that the Clintons are enmeshed with this sort of global, financial elite through their foundation, and just through the circles they travel in.I understand those concerns, and I guess part of the answer to that is the reality of 2016 is that the Senate Banking Committee has people like Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkel, and you are not going to get through legislation that is a sell out to Wall Street. Knowing that, and knowing that she does not want to fight within her party, I think she is pragmatic enough. The criticism occurs because she s been, you might say, too pragmatic. The fact is she is pragmatic enough to know that these people will not tolerate the kind of sell-out that I think many people have seen in previous administrations. I think it is unlikely that we will get policies that stray too far from the progressive agenda.Stiglitz credits Bernie Sanders with Hillary Clinton s more progressive policies. As for Clinton compared to Obama:More conservative than Hillary, yes. I think his temperament is basically more conservative and he did not go as far on Dodd-Frank as many people wanted. He opposed some of the key provisions that eventually got in the bill.For those who are still worried that Hillary Clinton will take on the more neoliberal policies of her husband, remember that times have changed and that we are no longer a center right nation. If anything, we are center left, and Clinton knows that if she disappoints the growing progressive wing of the Democratic party, she is doomed to just one term.Featured image via JP Yim/Getty Images.",News,"September 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Giuliani Demands That Democrats Apologize For Trump’s Racist Birtherism,"You know, because in fantasyland Republicans never questioned the citizenship of America s first black president.But that s exactly what they did for years and Donald Trump led the charge by going on or calling into Fox News every chance he could in order to demand President Obama s birth certificate.It was Trump who constantly claimed President Obama was born in Kenya even though Hawaii newspapers from the time announce Obama s birth.Trump and his birther fans were finally utterly humiliated when President Obama released his birth certificate to the public.And now that birtherism is coming back to bite Trump on the ass as he tries to convince black voters that he isn t a racist.Part of the reason why black voters reject Trump is because he questioned the citizenship of President Obama simply because he is black. But Trump wants everyone to pretend he didn t say any nasty things about President Obama and Trump pawn Rudy Giuliani is demanding that Democrats apologize for Trump s birtherism.Giuliani, who has taken to forgetting about 9/11 recently, appeared on CNN with Jake Tapper on Sunday and was grilled because Trump has not apologized for his birtherism. Many African-Americans say they are still troubled by Mr. Trump having suggested over and over, falsely, that the first African-American president was born in Africa and thus ineligible to be president  Tapper began.Giuliani immediately blamed Hillary Clinton for starting the birther conspiracy, but Tapper quickly fact-checked Giuliani, which forced him to blame Clinton s campaign instead.Giuliani then attempted to portray Trump as a hero for  resolving  the conspiracy, claiming that black people  have a faulty memory. He literally thinks black people should thank Trump for being a birther.But Tapper was quick to remind Giuliani that it was President Obama who resolved the conspiracy by releasing his birth certificate in 2011 while Trump was still pushing his birtherism four years later in February 2015 when he told CPAC that he thinks the birth certificate is fake. So apparently Trump thinks it hasn t been resolved, thus blowing Giuliani s claim out of the water. Should he just apologize for this if he really wants to reach out to minority voters?  Tapper asked.Giuliani replied by demanding that Democrats apologize for calling Trump s birtherism racist and went on to bash President Obama. If everybody apologized for all the things they said in politics, all we would be doing on television shows is apologizing. Maybe all the Democrats should apologize for calling Donald Trump a racist and calling him all kinds of terrible names and it gets a little silly. Food stamps have gone up two and a half times under Barack Obama,  he added.  He should be ashamed of himself. Jobs should have gone up two and a half times. My only point is that many African-Americans are still mad about Donald Trump having tried to invalidate Barack Obama by claiming he was born in Africa,  Tapper responded before giving up and moving on.Here s the video via YouTube:Giuliani seems to be forgetting that the recession that began under George W. Bush and the Republicans in 2008 caused more families to need food stamps in the first place, which is why the number of people on food stamps has gone up. Also, President Obama has set a record for the most consecutive months of jobs created and is actually one of the best job-creating presidents over the last 40 years.Once again, Giuliani gets caught talking out of his ass and he must be truly desperate if he is resorting to demanding an apology from Democrats for Trump s racism.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"September 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 REPORT: Priebus Withdraws Plans To Prop Trump Up After Hearing His Hateful Immigration Speech,"Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus keeps trying to put lipstick on his pig of a presidential nominee. However, he is quickly learning that it just isn t working. Reportedly, Priebus had planned to use the RNC s Twitter account to heap praise upon Trump following his immigration speech. However, as we all know by now, the speech turned out to be a disaster.It was full of nativist, hateful, anti-immigrant rhetoric and renewed talk of so-called  deportation forces,  as well as language that re-enforced the idea that immigrants are taking over the country and killing Americans. In other words, it was nothing but piece after piece of red meat for his racist, ignorant, hateful base of already-won white supporters. Hell, he even had surrogates whose children had been killed by undocumented immigrants making the rounds in the news media the next day.However, the speech backfired. So much, in fact that half of Trump s Hispanic Outreach Advisory Board is either reconsidering or outright withdrawing their support (well, at least the ones who aren t afraid of  taco trucks on every corner ). To that end, Priebus was unable to do as he had planned and try and make Trump s immigration speech look good and presidential to the American people.When will Reince Priebus, Paul Ryan, and all the rest of the GOP leadership learn? Trump might have won that nomination fair and square, but that doesn t mean he is qualified for the job of President of the United States. Donald Trump is like a toddler that Priebus and Ryan and all the rest are trying to potty train   he ll do well and poop in his training pot here and there, but for the most part, he still takes his biggest dumps in his pull-ups, and they have to clean it up.Well, there s no cleaning this one up, boys. Trump s a racist demagogue, a charlatan who is unfit to hold the office he seeks, and nothing you tell the American people, nothing he reads from any teleprompter, can change that.Featured image via Aaron P.

 Detroit Mayor Blasts Trump’s ‘Phony’ Black Church Visit,"Donald Trump, knowing that his poll numbers with black voters are abysmal, decided to spend part of his Saturday at a black church, Detroit s Great Faith International Ministries. However, it could not be more clear that he was in no way wanted there. Firstly, protesters showed up in throngs to condemn his visit, and then, the Democratic mayor, Mike Duggan, held a press conference slamming Trump s presence in his city. Duggan said: I feel like I m watching the next season of  The Apprentice.' This is the most phony major party nominee that I ve seen in my lifetime, and that s why we re skeptical. Trump s visit included a conversation with the church s Bishop, Wayne Jackson, and remarks to the congregation about how he supposedly will help African Americans (or perhaps just his way of saying how much he loves  the blacks ). Duggan, however, saw through the charade, and said of Trump s pandering: Are you here just to use Detroiters as props in a re-imaging campaign, or are you here to have a real conversation where you re finally going to give us the specifics on what you re going to do to make American cities better? Another local Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Brenda Lawrence, joined Duggan in his condemnation of Trump. She made a point of reminding everyone of the insulting language Trump uses when speaking of African Americans in his so-called  outreach.  Rep. Lawrence said: He said when he sees an African American that I am broke, I am unemployed, I m uneducated, and whenever I walk out my door I m being shot. What do I have to lose?  I don t want my grandchild to listen to the rhetoric that she, as a woman and as an African-American, is classified and stereotyped as uneducated. Of course, both Duggan and Lawrence are right. Trump is absolutely clueless. This visit, like all of his other events that are done anywhere except in front of all white audience where he s shouting about minorities and dog whistling racists, is nothing more than a photo-op, a way to gain a few votes from the gullible, and most importantly to make sure that suburban white America thinks he is just not racist enough for them to be able to vote for him with a clear conscience.Featured image via Aaron P.

 Longtime GOP Consultant Throws His Party Under The Bus By Explaining Voter ID Laws,"A longtime Republican consultant, Carter Wrenn, has finally said what the rest of the GOP won t about voter ID laws. In-person voter fraud is an excuse, and the laws that force people to obtain certain identification, along with limiting or eliminating early voting and other provisions, wouldn t happen if the black community would just vote Republican.You can t make this up. Wrenn told the Washington Post: Look, if African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican, they would have kept early voting right where it was. It wasn t about discriminating against African Americans. They just ended up in the middle of it because they vote Democrat. So it was about discriminating against African-Americans. How on Earth does Wrenn get from  If African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican  to,  This wasn t about discrimination?  There s no way to make that leap of logic without an awful lot of crazy gymnastics.Basically, Wrenn just admitted that Republicans wouldn t push down the black community if the black community would just do what Republicans want. Republicans would probably be all for fixing inner cities, passing jobs bills, passing crime bills, ensuring the social safety net isn t gutted, and more, if the black community voted Republican. But, since they don t, fuck  em. The GOP has to protect its majorities, after all.Wake County, in North Carolina, the state whose voter ID law Wrenn was discussing, says that more early voting would just waste tax dollars and cause additional chaos. Excuses, excuses, and flimsy ones at that. All the county boards in North Carolina are Republican under state law because the governor is a Republican. They re apparently all on his side with rationalizing away their blatant discrimination any way they can.The Supreme Court refused to grant a stay on a lower court s decision that North Carolina s law was crafted with the specific intent of suppressing the black vote. Governor Pat McCrory threw a livid fit, saying that the Court had denied basic voting rights to North Carolina that other states are allowed to enjoy.It s really the state that s trying to deny basic voting rights to their black community, all in the name of  preventing voter fraud,  and protecting  one person, one vote.  McCrory has his lies all lined up in a neat little row, though, and will use them, one after the other, for as long as he has to.The GOP needs to clean its own house before they cry about voter fraud. Their standard-bearer s own campaign CEO is guilty of attempting voter fraud, which just makes them utter hypocrites for tolerating that and whining up a storm about the need to prevent voter fraud.But don t call them racist, and don t call these laws racist! The GOP has this strange need to convince itself that this isn t about racism. Consider this, though: even if it truly wasn t about racism, they re still working to actively deny people their constitutional right to vote. Wrenn just damned his party with that interview.Featured image by Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"September 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Donald Trump PROMISES To Break Federal Law, Force Public Schools To “Teach Patriotism” (VIDEO)","In a speech to the American Legion, the largest veteran organization in the country, Donald Trump alarmingly went full fascist when he promised to  promote pride and patriotism in American schools.  When you add that to his attacks on the press, support of nationalists, quoting of dictators, and lack of support for the freedom of speech, the picture that is painted is very clear.The troubling remarks began early in his speech: I want to begin by discussing one goal that I know is so important to all of you: promoting American pride and patriotism in America s schools.In A Trump Administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America s children. We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America s history, its institutions, and its heroes.We will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America.We will be united by our common culture, values and principles   becoming One American Nation. And if you re one of many parents who have trouble with children mindlessly repeating the pledge of allegiance   many of whom don t know what the words  pledge  and  allegiance  mean   he s got bad news for you, specifically: That flag deserves respect, and I will work with American Legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag   and, by the way, we want young Americans to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. In other words, Trump wants right-wing nationalist propaganda in public schools. That s probably because Republicans have a serious problem with history, and an even bigger problem with teaching it to kids. After all, they might learn that the United States is not inherently morally superior and beyond reproach by definition! That s why in 2014, House Republicans actually expressed their displeasure with, you know, facts, and passed a resolution saying they don t approve of high school AP History. Seriously.The following Al Franken quote comes to mind: You have to love your country like an adult loves somebody, not like a child loves its mommy. And right-wing Republicans tend to love America like a child loves its mommy, where everything Mommy does is okay. But adult love means you re not in denial, and you want the loved one to be the best they can be. That s not the only reason Trump s idea is a bad one. It s also illegal. As Military Times points out:Public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money. Most schools receive little federal funding.Current federal law prohibits the federal government from exercising  any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system. Good luck with that, Trump.You can watch the full video of his speech below:Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"September 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CNN Reporter DESTROYS Trump Surrogate’s ‘Birtherism’ Lies With Pure Facts (VIDEO),"Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes has made some moronic comments in the past, and it s epic every time she gets called out on it. Just days after she got slammed for her comments on gun violence, Hughes got fact-checked AGAIN on CNN by news anchor Poppy Harlow and activist Bakari Sellers.Commenting on Trump s horrendous standing amongst minorities, Harlow noted that Trump is doing worse in this area than even third party candidates. Hughes tried to defend the Republican nominee, stating that Trump holds rallies  all over the country  and that the  doors are open  to everyone. In actuality, Trump usually holds his rallies in mostly-white areas, and has kicked out his own supporters for having dark skin in the past.Making a reference to Trump s recent pathetic attempt to appeal to the African American community, Sellers told Hughes that Trump wouldn t be getting a  participation trophy  just because he happened to visit one black neighborhood during his whole campaign. Sellers said: I know that many surrogates and many supporters of Donald Trump like to take the man away from his baggage, but you cannot sit here and not remember that Donald Trump is the one who supported the  Birther  movement   and just yesterday in Philadelphia he refused to even apologize for it. To drive his point home, Sellers brought up the fact that Trump hadn t wanted to have black tenants in New York City, along with Trump s infamous full-page ad that called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five decades ago. Hughes countered this by saying that Trump s racist housing woes were probably 30, 35 years ago  and  obviously Mr. Trump addressed it.  Then, she accused the press of trying to  trap him in different aspects. Hughes continued on to say that even though former KKK leader David Duke had endorsed Trump, Clinton s endorsement by  California grand dragon KKK leader today  was worse. She said: Hillary Clinton has yet to disavow him, so there s ties on both sides. Harlow tried to grasp just what Hughes was trying to say, and she asked her to clarify. Hughes responded, I m saying that Hillary Clinton has actually stronger ties, that has not disavowed a KKK endorsement. Sellers jumped in and defended the former Secretary of State: Scottie and any other surrogate and Donald Trump himself are going to have an extremely hard time with this argument. I think they re actually going down the wrong path that somehow Hillary Clinton is the bigot in this situation, or has some racist past or racist history, because that s simply not the case. Then, Hughes made the mistake of trying to accuse Clinton of being involved in the Birther movement during the 2008 campaign. Unable to stand this insanity any longer, Harlow jumped in and shut the whole thing down. She said: Scottie, that is not factual. That is not factually correct. Hillary Clinton never questioned the birthplace of Barack Obama when she was running against him. Trump, on the other hand, has   several times and continues to do so today.

" Fox News Hacked Phone Records, Emails Of Media Matters Journalists","The drama just never ends for poor Fox News, thanks to the shady shenanigans of Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch. It seems they re guilty of far more than rampant sexual harassment of female employees. Ailes loved to find out where other organizations were getting their info on Fox. To that end, he had private investigators get into the phone records of journalists, like those who work at Media Matters For America.Media Matters  official mission is to act as a watchdog on U.S. media. However, for a long time, it seemed their whole mission was to expose the dishonesty that spews forth from the lying monster that is Fox News. One such reporter, Joe Strupp, would repeatedly name anonymous Fox sources in his stories, and, well, of course Ailes couldn t have that. He had to know who these sources were (probably to harass, threaten, and then fire them for good measure).Fox News  legal minion, according to New York Magazine, hired private investigators to obtain Strupp s phone records in 2010. These weren t just phone records from the office, though. They also got hold of records from his home phone and personal cell phone through what NYMag is terming,  legally questionable means. That probably means it was illegal, but Brandi, the legal minion in question, denies that this ever happened. However, one Fox executive told NYMag anyway: This was the culture. Getting phone records doesn t make anybody blink. Even if, and when, it s illegal to do so, apparently.Bradley Beychock, president of Media Matters, spoke to the Daily Beast about these allegations. It appears that Strupp wasn t Fox s only target. According to Beychock: We know there are allegations of email and phone records being obtained, but do not know precisely how. It s part of our internal review now. He also said: We are not sure of how widespread the issue may be in regards to our employees. However, in addition to Joe Strupp there is at least one other current Media Matters colleague who we have reason to believe also had their phone records obtained. In most places, private investigators cannot obtain someone s phone records without their consent, and people rarely give their consent for that. They can also obtain a court order or a subpoena to do it. However, it s not likely Media Matters  employees even knew their communications had been hacked and given to Fox.Fox would not have wanted to wait for the courts, because chances were they knew the courts would shoot them down. This smacks of a company that hopes they could do this without getting caught.At this point, Fox News and its parent, 21st Century Fox, are in way too deep. Their, ahem, questionable business practices are fireballing them right into hell. As Crooks and Liars asked at the end of their story, how far are Murdoch & Co. willing to go to clean this all up?Featured image by Frederick M.

 Trump’s Own Running Mate Just Put Him To SHAME With A Simple Promise,"In an appearance on NBC s  Meet the Press,  Mike Pence promised to do something that people have clamored for Trump to do for months. It s simple   he plans to release his tax returns. Within the next week. Which is far sooner than anything we can ever expect from The Donald.Of course, despite shaming the hell out of his running mate like this, Pence still had to say that Trump will make good on his promise, too: Donald Trump and I are both going to release our tax returns. I ll release mine in the next week.Donald Trump will be releasing his tax returns at the completion of an audit. What baloney; the audit is an excuse. Trump can release his tax returns despite the audit, he just won t. Richard Nixon, arguably our most dishonest president ever, released his returns under audit. Apparently, though, Trump hiding them and being as opaque as possible is on the advice of an adviser. It s not hard, however, to believe this adviser would tell him,  Don t release any information that makes you look bad in any way.  Yet much of the public is wondering what he s hiding in there, including many in his own party.Both Hillary and her running mate, Tim Kaine, have already released their tax returns, further shaming the Trumpmeister. That s expected, though. One hardly expects one s own running mate to do the same thing.Hillary and Bill Clinton paid an effective tax rate of just over 43 percent. Maybe Trump is worried how much of the world will see how he evades taxes, or that he s lied about being able to get away with paying a very low tax rate. Or both. In that very vein, Trump himself has rather hypocritically said: So you know if you re running, at a minimum, probably you re going to have to show your returns. If you didn t see the tax returns you would think there s almost like something wrong, what s wrong. So what s wrong with the Donald that he won t release his tax returns? He s eating his own words. The fact that his own running mate is willing to do this, while he himself is not, is laughable at best. No doubt they think this will bring some credibility back to their campaign, but it will also make lots of people turn back to Trump and say,  Show us your taxes, now that your own running mate has done it! Of course Pence tried to cover for that, but either he is lying through his teeth and has no intention of releasing his returns next week, or he s about to make Trump look really, really bad.Featured image by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News,"September 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Detroit Reverend BLASTS Trump’s ‘Scam’ He Just Tried To Pull On Voters (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s visit to a historically black church in Detroit, Michigan on Saturday is being met with fierce condemnation from black leaders. Reverend Wendell Anthony is one of those leaders who is calling out Trump. On Saturday, Anthony, who is the head of the Detroit NAACP chapter, appeared on CNN where he derided the entire visit as a  scam. This is nothing more than a ruse. This is a scam,  Anthony said during the segment.  Mr. Trump is seventy years old, I believe. That election now is less than seventy days from now. It s gonna take a whole lot of conjecture and whole lot of programming to undo what has been done. Anthony is correct. Trump has polling numbers so low with voters of color that it seems almost absurd at this point to try and win them over so close to the election. Considering Trump s support from white supremacist groups, and his recently solidified multi-media brand promotion deal relationship with the reactionary media site Breitbart, which has historically upheld white supremacist positions, there isn t a snowball s chance in hell those numbers will go up. In fact, since Trump began his new strategy of begging voters of color to take a chance on him, his polling numbers with the voting bloc have plummeted even further.Then there s also this long list of reasons that Anthony lists off: Before you talk about the can-do, let s talk about the undo,  he continued.  Let s undo what Mr. Trump has done. Part of what he said is that we need to unite the country. Well his policies, or lack thereof, his commentary, his rhetoric, is doing no more than dividing this nation. When you talk about  I don t want black people counting my money,  or rather have  short folk with yarmulkes counting my money    that s divisive! It s rather amusing to see someone whose entire political career thus far has been made possible by the far right s racism and xenophobia try and pander to voters of color. There s also something sad about it. Very sad!You can watch the video below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"September 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 When Asked If Trump Learned Anything In Detroit Ben Carson LITERALLY Runs Away (VIDEO),"As you are probably aware, Donald Trump decided to pop into Detroit for an ill-advised attempt to form a false, vote-getting connection with the African-American community. Currently, the Donald is doing worse with minorities than even Mitt Romney did during his presidential run against Barack Obama, and his previous outreach efforts   telling African-Americans they are poor, uneducated, and have nothing to offer the world   as well as his tight connections with the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups are not doing him any favors.After Trump s embarrassing, scripted interview with a Detroit pastor was leaked, Trump knew he had to step it up. So he went out into the community to visit the neighborhood of his former rival-turned-paid-servant Ben Carson (yes, the one in which he tried to stab someone only to be thwarted by a belt buckle). CNN caught up with Carson after Trump left and asked him what was apparently a difficult question. We just saw Mr. Trump here and I asked him how did it go and he said  Great.  He said he learned a lot of things. What do you think he took away from today?  CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond asked.That s right   he asked Carson if Trump learned something from spending a few minutes around black people. This led Carson to have a  Rubio moment,  but with luggage rather than a water bottle. Carson s face twisted into a look of concern, then terror:Then he walked away, successfully avoiding the question.How did Donald Trump do during his visit? Not only was the church he visited virtually empty, but one woman who lives in Carson s childhood home told the Detroit Free Press that Trump s visit was clearly a photo-op. Her takeaway from his obvious and meaningless attempt to pander to the African-American community while offering nothing substantive is that people should  vote Democratic.

 Gingrich Seriously Thinks Trump Could Get More Black Votes ‘Than Any Republican In Modern Times’,"Former House Speaker and Trump supporter Newt Gingrich has gone completely delusional, having somehow convinced himself that Donald Trump could somehow manage to get more of the Africa American vote  than any Republican in modern times. (Go ahead and laugh, I ll wait.) Donald Trump is the first Republican I can remember who is explicitly saying to the African-American community,  Things can be better, but not with Democrats in charge,'  Gingrich said during an interview with Fox News. If [Trump] continues to say it, and if he has the courage to go back to places like Chicago and say it, I think he s going get far more votes from the black community than any Republican in modern times. The GOP nominee has kicked off  minority outreach  efforts in recent weeks, but by all accounts, this has done him little if any favors. Trump s grand scheme so far has been to say that people of color should vote for him because their lives suck so bad that they don t really have anything to lose anyway, so why not give him a shot and see what happens. Mind you, he has primarily said this to predominately white crowds, which has also drawn criticism.On Saturday, Trump attended a service at a black church in Detroit, which turned out to be as much of a failure as the rest of his attempts to pander to African Americans. The bigoted billionaire s speech was carefully scripted, but judging by the empty church, nobody really wanted to hear his schpeel anyway. However, looking at how many protesters turned out for the event, it is pretty clear that nobody is buying his latest line of bullsh*t.Watch Gingrich lose all touch with reality, here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZK_mNHZqZU]Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Awkwardly Panders To Empty Black Church So White People Will Vote For Him,"Trump has recently caught on to the fact that there just aren t quite enough angry white guys and open racists to get him elected, and has decided to strike a more moderate tone   sometimes   in an effort to have broader appeal. If you believe the Trump camp, he s honestly trying to court the vote of black Americans. For those of us that weren t born yesterday, it s pretty obvious what the real goal is here: He s trying send a message to the  not racist  white voters at home that it really is morally acceptable to vote for him, promise!And it s pretty obvious black people aren t buying it, either. Trump has made headlines today for a highly publicized photo op at an African-American church ( This is the first African-American church he s been in y all,  Bishop Jackson said, as he introduced him) but apparently, a significant percentage of the congregation stiffed him. There were also protests outside, and inside, the building was nearly empty, as shown in this Tweet by Politico s Shane Goldmacher: Nowhere near a full crowd as Trump enters (far left) pic.twitter.com/kL1AlVukG4  Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) September 3, 2016Even for this photo op, Trump was not fully able to turn the racism off, however. His speech, obviously written by someone else, was full of subdued tones and pandering, but this video clip by ABC News probably sums it up best:  .@realDonaldTrump:  A lot of people don t realize  Abraham Lincoln was a Republican https://t.co/q9Gu8G8cMw https://t.co/i4kQQ7cPF2  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 3, 2016Because if you re black and from Detroit, what are the chances you know anything about American history, amiright?

Westbrook said Trump would struggle to cut into Clinton s overwhelming support among African-Americans.  Her track record is so long with black people,  he said, mentioning her work for children in the 1970s.  Donald Trump hasn t done anything for black people in 30 years. As I said, Trump s not fooling anybody. And to you conservative-leaning white people that aren t racist and have felt better about voting for Trump over the last week of his  outreach,  don t. He s still as racist and repugnant as always, and the fact that his  outreach  has consisted of assuaging the doubts of suburban whites makes his racism insidiously worse than ever.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Black Religious Leaders DENOUNCE Trump As The Fraud That He Is,"Donald Trump recently attended a conservative, black church in Detroit in an effort to reach out to black voters. As expected, it was an embarrassment, and the black community was not fooled by Trump s pandering photo-op.Perhaps one of the mast damning of all criticism comes from across the board religious leaders, all of them black, from the Detroit metropolitan are. They all had the same message for Trump   we aren t fooled.The Council of Baptist Pastors of Detroit and Vicinity penned a scathing letter signed by representatives of 10 different Christian denominations on Saturday, blasting the opportunism of the Trump campaign and its brazen language and exploitation:We   have been avoided and overlooked in regards to the upcoming appearance of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in Detroit   Racism, bigotry, misogyny, hate speech, sexism, divisiveness, threats, a call to harm, discrimination, bullying, and fearmongering have no place in the White House in the greatest country in the world.In addition to the Baptist leadership, representatives from the Metropolitan Organizing Strategy Enabling Strength; the Michigan chapter of Church of God in Christ; the Evangelical Lutheran, and Episcopal Church all signed on.In total, these religious organizations represent over 200 African-American churches in southeastern Michigan alone.The president of the Baptist Pastor s council, Rev. Lawrence Glass, blasted Trump as an insult to the African Americans and minorities, saying his attacks on Muslims, immigrants and Hispanics.Glass also pointed out that Trump  has no history of helping minorities, of going to the inner city to help out people of color  He has done absolutely nothing,  and  He wants us to believe him  He must think we re really, really naive and ignorant of his past practices. Although these churches and their leaders have a huge  disdain  for Trump, they have said that doesn t necessarily mean they re all in for Hillary Clinton.The chairman of Detroit Ecumenical Ministers, the Rev. Horace Sheffield, accused Trump of using blacks as  political props. Trump and his campaign thought they could trick black voters into supporting him by appealing to their religious convictions. Unlike the rabid, faux Christian evangelicals represented by people like Billy Graham and Michele Bachmann, black religious leaders actually follow by example. And Trump certainly does not fit their mold.Here s an important reminder for Trump: the most religious group in America are black women. Black women are also Democratic voters, and for good reason. They aren t so easily tricked by a predatory white nationalist.Another Trump  pivot  gone horribly wrong.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"September 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Reporter Presses Trump On Birther Conspiracy And Trump Cannot Handle It (VIDEO),"Only but a few years ago, during far simpler times, Donald Trump s biggest accomplishment in politics was his amplification of the birther conspiracy. The right-wing conspiracy alleges that President Obama is not qualified to be the president of the United States because he was not born on U.S. soil. It s a ridiculous conspiracy that resulted in the Tea Party demanding that President Obama release his birth certificate to the public.Trump has been all but silent on the matter since he began his campaign. Now that he is currently the second likeliest person in the world to replace Mr. Obama, people are eager to hear if Trump still believes in the conspiracy theory.On Friday, Trump made a stop in Philadelphia, where he was set to pander to the African-American community.WPVI news anchor Matt O  Donnell questioned Trump on his past views regarding President Obama and the birther movement. You don t talk about the birth certificate anymore, says O  Donnell.  Do you regret even bringing it up? Trump responds by saying,  I don t talk about it anymore. I don t talk about it anymore. O  Donnell then presses Trump.  Do you regret bringing it up back then? I told you, I don t talk about it anymore,  Trump says.That appears to be as close to an answer as the public gets concerning Trump s thoughts on the matter. It seems as if Trump knows just exactly how absurd the affair was, yet cannot admit as much, due to not wanting to alienate his conspiracy theory minded, Tea Party base.You can watch the interview below: Featured image from video screenshot",News,"September 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

His history of racism is lengthy and well-documented. He is just doing what he always does   pandering to whatever audience he is speaking to at any given moment. He s just as much of a bigot as ever.

 WATCH: One Of Trump’s Biggest Supporters Is Outed As A Complete Fraud On The Air,"The right-wing pastor who posted a cartoon of Hillary Clinton in black-face just got his a** handed to him by CNN.Pastor Mark Burns has been one of Donald Trump s biggest cheerleaders. On his church website, he bragged about his military experience in the Army and claimed that he graduated from North Greenville University with a Bachelor of Science.The only problem is that neither of those claims are even remotely true, which means Burns has been lying to his congregation and the American people.During an interview with CNN host Victor Blackwell, Burns was taken by surprise when called out for posting false information about himself.When asked if he attended the university, Burns said that he had, but then Blackwell confronted Burns about the claim on his website that he actually graduated. As it turns out, Burns only attended for one semester.Burns whined and claimed that the interview was supposed to be  off the record,  but Blackwell made it clear that he  didn t agree to that. Burns continuing complaining and accused Blackwell of character assassination. This is not fair at all,  Burns whined.  I thought we were doing a profile and all of a sudden you re here to try to destroy my character. I m not here to destroy your character,  Blackwell said before getting back to the results of CNN s investigation.Blackwell proceeded to grill Burns and revealed that not only did Burns not graduate from North Greenville University, he didn t serve six years in the Army either. He only briefly served in the National Guard.Here s the video via YouTube.Burns later released a statement claiming that he only lied in his biography because he wanted to be taken seriously as a pastor. As a young man starting my church in Greenville, South Carolina, I overstated several details of my biography because I was worried I wouldn t be taken seriously as a new pastor. This was wrong. I wasn t truthful then and I have to take full responsibility for my actions. Burns, who has raked in the money as a televangelist, has built his empire on a foundation of lies that automatically disqualifies him from serving as a so-called  man of God. This man lied to become a pastor and he has been lying to his congregation ever since.But Burns could not even take full responsibility for his sins as he blamed the media and claimed that he is only being outed because he is a black man who supports Donald Trump. I do also want to set the record straight about why this attack is happening   because I am a black man supporting Donald Trump for president. For too long, African-American votes have been taken for granted by Democratic politicians, and enough is enough. So Burns literally played the race card, which something conservatives hypocritically often claim that liberals do.So not only is Burns a liar, he s a hypocrite and one has to wonder what else he is hiding.Featured Image: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images",News,"September 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Colbert Found Trump’s Pro-Police Brutality Cop He Won’t Stop Talking About,"As Twitter so perfectly demonstrated, Republican presidential nominee Donald trump has a problem with citing his sources. One example of this is his recent claim that he met with a  top cop  in the Chicago Police Department who said that police officers need to have more freedom to be  tougher  with suspected criminals. All I know is this,  Trump said.  I went to a top police officer in Chicago, who is not the police chief, and I could see by the way he was dealing with his people, he was a rough, tough guy, they respected him greatly. The claim appears to be a total fabrication by Trump, as the Chicago PD denies any knowledge of such a meeting occurring.The claim provided the Late Show all the material they needed for a hilarious lesson on the importance of being able to cite your sources when making claims on the campaign trail.Colbert says that the Late Show did some digging and found the police officer who Trump claims to have spoken to. That s when Colbert introduces  Officer Rod Johnson  to the audience. Officer Johnson, who is a  rough tough cop  that  isn t afraid to get down and dirty  says that he told Trump that,  there are some naughty people out there who need to be in cuffs. The segment concludes with the Officer Johnson tearing off his clothes and dancing to music. Officer Johnson then says,  Stephen, you have the right to remain sexy. This is what happens when you say controversial things that you cannot back up with any facts.You can watch the segment below in full.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 WATCH: Sexist Breitbart Editor Gets His A** Handed To Him By ABC Reporter,"Breibart editor Milo Yiannopoulos is the obnoxious little twerp who got banned from Twitter for inciting his fans to viciously attack comedian Leslie Jones in an effort to humiliate her.Now karma has finally turned the tables on Yiannopoulos.During an interview with ABC s Terry Moran that will air on Nightline this Friday, Yiannopoulos was the one who got humiliated this time as Moran took this asshole who has the maturity of a 12-year-old boy to school.Yiannopoulos began by calling himself a  virtuous troll  who is  doing God s work. If Leslie Jones were right here, would you say,  You look like a dude ?  Moran asked. Yeah, probably,  Yiannopoulos replied. You would say that to her?  a disgusted Moran said.Once again, Yiannopoulos has zero remorse for his ugly attack and said he would do it again, which led to Moran smacking the Breitbart bully down. Then you re an idiot,  Moran told him.Yiannopoulos argued that he is not responsible for what his fans do even though it was his sexism and hate that made Jones a target for harassment in the first place. Does Justin Bieber have an obligation to his fans? I m sorry for being popular. But I am not responsible for what 350,000 people on the Internet say. I m responsible for what I say. Yeah, and what you said incited your fans to attack as if they were your own personal army of Internet trolls. If Justin Beiber launched a Twitter tirade against Selena Gomez that resulted in his fans attacking her, he would be responsible for it. Just like Yiannopoulos is responsible for the attack on Jones.Words have consequences and Yiannopoulos is finding that out the hard way.Moran responded by putting Yiannopoulis in his place with an epic smackdown that is incredibly enjoyable to watch. You re going to go after somebody s body to denigrate their ideas? What grade are you in? Are you a 13-year-old boy? Because somebody doesn t have a weight that you think is proper? That s revolting. And Yiannopoulos responded by being a misogynist asshole. I ll tell you what s revolting. What s revolting is the body positivity movement. What s revolting is this idea now that you can tell women that they ll be healthy at any size. Here s the video via YouTube:Trolls like Yiannopoulos should be banned from using the Internet entirely. He should not have a platform to bully others and spread his hate. And of course, he s a supporter of Donald Trump, which makes him even more of a prick. But you can bet that sexist trolls like Yiannopoulos will become even more emboldened if the Republican nominee should win in November, which makes it even more important that he lose by a humiliating landslide.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"September 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" He Did It Again: With Only Months Left, Obama Makes HUGE Move To Fix The World","President Barack Obama only has a little more than five months left in his final term, a period in which other two-term leaders have simply set themselves in neutral and coasted to the finish line. Even as his presidential approval rises and the economy improves, Obama has chosen a different path on his way out.On Saturday morning the world got more evidence of his decision to get as much done in the time he has left as the U.S. and China announced a major agreement to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.At a ceremony on the sidelines of a global economic summit, Obama and Xi, representing the world s two biggest carbon emitters, delivered a series of documents to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The papers certified the U.S. and China have taken the necessary steps to join the Paris accord that set nation-by-nation targets for cutting carbon emissions. This is not a fight that any one country, no matter how powerful, can take alone,  Obama said of the pact.  Some day we may see this as the moment that we finally decided to save our planet. Other countries need to sign on to the agreement, but America and China are the two most consequential. Both countries are responsible for 38 percent of man-made carbon emissions in the entire world. By making this agreement, the two nations are setting the tone for everyone else.Climate change, which has been verified by scientific study after scientific study, is still rejected by Republicans who are compromised by donations from big business. The current Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, takes this opposition to science even further with his conspiracy theory that climate change is a completely made up idea from the Chinese government.President Obama has embraced science, as have most Democrats   including Hillary Clinton. Instead of twiddling his thumbs as the situation worsens, he s chosen to do something towards the end of his presidency about a critical issue. He isn t done. Not yet.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Arizona Democratic Party PERFECTLY Trolls Trump And His Surrogate Over ‘Tacos On Every Corner’,"One of Trump s Latino surrogates, Marco Gutierrez, warned us of an oddly specific horror should we not elect Trump in November. Apparently, he thinks we ll have taco trucks on every corner, because his culture is very dominant and it s causing problems. Most of America seems to see this as the opposite of a problem, though, including the Arizona Democratic Party. They re going to host a taco truck on their particular corner of Phoenix this weekend.The horror. The sheer, hilarious horror of it all. Someone make them stop before others get ideas and we see more taco trucks pop up.They even changed their sign. Check it out below:.@AZDemParty updated its sign, y all.

And those voters will be Democratic as well.Gutierrez shot himself, and Trump, in the foot here. They can probably expect much more trolling over this, while Trump tries to warn us that these taco trucks are a mere harbinger of all the terrible things to come should Hillary get elected.

 Donald Trump Isn’t Even Paying His Top Staffers,"Donald Trump likes to brag occasionally that he runs a very frugal campaign. Supporters have said this is proof that he ll run a very frugal country, too. How is it that he regularly only spends a fraction of what Hillary spends on her campaign? A large part of it is that he doesn t pay his many of his staffers   not even his top ten staffers.That s not frugal. That s cheap.Kellyanne Conway, who became Trump s campaign manager after Paul Manafort left, hasn t been paid for her work in July, according to FEC filings. Paul Manafort wasn t paid for his work. Michael Caputo, Trump s former communications director, hasn t been paid. While a legal scholar says that it s unusual for a campaign to have volunteers at such high levels, Caputo says he was not a volunteer. Sometimes, people at high levels will opt to be unpaid, such as John Podesta, who is working on Hillary Clinton s campaign.But Caputo wasn t among staffers who may have done that. He just hasn t been paid.People at these levels usually draw a six-figure salary, so what is up with this? Contrary to Trump supporters  claims, this is not a good thing. This does not demonstrate that Trump will be the fiscal conservative they re praying for. This shows a man who s unwilling to pay people for legitimate work. People really think he s going to fight to bring the good-paying jobs back? Ha! Not bloody likely. Not if he won t even take care of his own staff.He s become a typical greedy businessman in that regard. To cut costs, hurt the people you depend on to keep your organization running. Hey, they re only people, and some people matter while others don t. If their stations are lower, they clearly don t matter.Of course, this is in addition to the gag orders that Trump makes people sign, promising not to say mean things about him upon leaving the campaign. Trump will surely treat everyone better once he s elected, though, right? Right. All he wants is to  make America great again. Or turn America into a cesspool, and then tell us that we ll call it great again and like it.Campaigns will generally rely on volunteers for low-level work, such as working phone banks and knocking on doors, mailing fliers, things of that nature. It s one thing if all of these staffers likewise agreed to be volunteers, but chances are at least some didn t, considering that Caputo didn t. That s disgraceful.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"September 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 What Trump Wants To Do To Your Children Would Break The Law,"Donald Trump recently gave a speech to the American Legion about the plans he has in mind for the children of America, and if he got his way it would affect every single one of them. But it would also break the law.Trump, playing to an audience with obvious military ties, brought up the idea of enforcing patriotism on children as part of the school curriculum.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump signaled Thursday plans to seek nationwide changes to school curricula with the goal of  promoting American pride and patriotism in America s schools. In a Trump administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America s children,  Trump said, speaking at the American Legion s annual convention in Cincinnati.While the candidate argued that  We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America s history, its institutions and its heroes,  doing so from the presidency would, in fact, break the law.Military Times, in their coverage of Trump s remarks, points this fact out:The comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools, which is prohibited under federal law.The comment is also ironic, as Trump has repeatedly claimed that he is opposed to Common Core because it supposedly imposes a top-down federal program in schools. In reality, the Common Core seeks to raise educational standards by rewarding local schools for improvements in their curriculum devised in the way they see fit, not as a top-down federal mandate.It is also unclear what brand of patriotism Trump would decide to enforce on American children. Throughout the campaign, he has advocated the idea that in his view certain races and faiths   particularly the Latino race and Muslim religion   are inferior and not worthy of Constitutional protections, when the actual Constitution makes no such distinctions. How could someone with that view seriously define patriotism for American children in all 50 states?Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Gretchen Carlson Recorded Roger Ailes’ Sexual Harassment,"The man now advising, coaching, and strategizing with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Roger Ailes, is going to be in a further world of hurt as New York Magazine reports that Gretchen Carlson taped his sexual prowess against her.According to the magazine:Taking on Ailes was dangerous, but Carlson was determined to fight back. She settled on a simple strategy: She would turn the tables on his surveillance. Beginning in 2014, according to a person familiar with the lawsuit, Carlson brought her iPhone to meetings in Ailes s office and secretly recorded him saying the kinds of things he d been saying to her all along.  I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago, and then you d be good and better and I d be good and better. Sometimes problems are easier to solve  that way, he said in one conversation.  I m sure you can do sweet nothings when you want to,  he said another time.Now who does this sound like?For over a year Carlson had been taping these instances and now that physical evidence is known to be in existence, will Trump continue to be an apologist for Ailes? Remember that back in July, Trump took Ailes  side and expressed doubt that Carlson was telling the truth, saying,  I can tell you that some of the women that are complaining, I know how much he s helped them, and even recently. In Trump s world, if a woman is given a promotion, a job to begin with, or sustains employment, there is no possible way that her boss can be a total predator. Trump, who paints himself to be the  law and order candidate,  has been taking advice from a man who sexually harassed and coerced female employees for years.This should go over well with female voters, in which Trump has record deficits with.If there s one thing this story can tell us, it s that Ailes and Trump are two peas in the sexist pod. They both are right-wing ideologues who built empires, and they both have an aura of sleaze that surrounds and follows them.I wonder how long it will take Trump to disavow.Featured image via Rich Polk/Getty Images",News,"September 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Wife Of Trump’s Doc Goes Batsh*t CRAZY On CNN, Threatens To Call Cops","Dr. Harold Bornstein has been practicing medicine for decades, but it wasn t until Donald Trump released a special note   written by him   that he actually became known around the country. The note, which raved about Trump s health, was full of typos and unprofessional language, earning criticism from the medical community and the media.To try to clear a few things up, CNN tried to interview Bornstein outside his office, but that interview came to an abrupt spot when the eccentric doctor s wife intervened and went totally nuts. Before the interview was cut short, CNN s Drew Griffin had been asking Bornstein about his reaction to all the backlash the infamous Trump note has gotten, and tried to get some clarity on whether or not the doctor had actually written the note in five minutes, as previously suggested. Noting that many in the medical community were saying Bornstein was a lunatic, Griffin grilled Bornstein about the note, which read if elected, Mr. Trump will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. Really, it sounds like Trump wrote the note himself. Bornstein responded: Well, a lunatic doesn t have my credentials. The only thing I wanted to do in my life is practice with my father, which I managed to do for 35 years. Griffin pressed Bornstein about the unprofessional language when describing Trump s health as  astonishingly excellent    something that had raised a lot of red flags amongst analysts. Bornstein began to get uncomfortable and say he was  rushed for time  and  had people to see. CNN was allowed to continue the interview in the hallway to save Bornstein time (they weren t allowed inside because Bornstein said his wife would be furious if she caught him conducted the interview). It was only a few moments before Bornstein s wife found out what was happening, flipped out and threatened to call the police on the network.You can watch the scene unfold below:Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Son BAFFLED As To Why His Racist Dad’s Anti-Hispanic Talk Pisses Off Hispanics,"Following the mass exodus of Hispanic surrogates from Trump s campaign, Eric Trump is pretty confused. After all, his dad has been very, very consistent about his plans on immigration, so why would they do this to the saintly candidate? Eric seems to think that, since nothing has changed, there s no reason for Hispanic advocates to be upset.He really doesn t get it. In an appearance on Fox & Friends, he actually said: [It] is actually pretty amazing considering the speech was actually very consistent and he has been very, very consistent with his plan. It s really interesting. What s interesting is not that Hispanics are now fleeing Trump   it s that Eric thinks his consistency should resonate with them.Trump went to Mexico to meet with President Enrique Pe a Nieto after appearing to soften his position on undocumented immigrants. So is it really any wonder that this return to his angry, heartless, racist stance that Hispanics are the enemy to  real  Americans feels like a betrayal?One particular surrogate who has worked very hard to convince Latinos to vote for Trump, Jacob Monty, resigned after Trump s speech on Wednesday night. He laid it all out in his explanation for leaving: I was a strong supporter of Donald Trump when I believed he was going to address the immigration problem realistically and compassionately. What I heard today was not realistic and not compassionate. Ramiro Pena, a church pastor in Texas, likewise yanked his support, saying: I am so sorry but I believe Mr. Trump lost the election tonight. The  National Hispanic Advisory Council  seems to be simply for optics and I do not have the time or energy for a scam. Everything Trump does for minority outreach is just for show. His visit to a black church in Detroit is nothing but a show, too. He s performing for an audience because that s all he knows how to do. Being serious about this is an alien concept to him. Republicans know it and are actually trying to figure out how to reach more white people because they ve given up on Trump ever reaching minorities. His  outreach  is too little, too late, and a total lie.Eric here is wearing his blinders a little too tightly. He hopes that clarifying Trump s message to these guys will turn them around, and he actually voiced the following clueless words: It s very important to us. If you look at the Hispanic community and the Latino community, they ve largely been left behind in this country. But his father talking about splitting up families and wasting ungodly amounts of money on a wall and on deportation isn t going to leave these communities further back in the dust? Har de har har, don t make us laugh too hard. It hurts.Eric Trump should at least have an idea that a consistent message targeting and alienating a group is just going to consistently piss them off. Eventually, people get tired of hoping someone will change, and they just walk away.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"September 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Newest Clinton Email Scandal Actually PROVES There’s No Scandal,"On Thursday, the New York Times published an article entitled  Emails Raise New Questions About Clinton Foundation Ties to State Department.  Then, we read the article. Let s just say that not only is there no there there, the article literally proves the exact opposite of what they are trying to say.The lede paragraph of the article says this:A top aide to Hillary Clinton at the State Department agreed to try to obtain a special diplomatic passport for an adviser to former President Bill Clinton in 2009, according to emails released Thursday, raising new questions about whether people tied to the Clinton Foundation received special access at the department.That sounds pretty, well,  damning  is perhaps too strong a word, but the very next paragraph admits that the adviser, Douglas J. Band, didn t get the passport. Think about it, not even an adviser to the Secretary of State s very own husband, who happens to be a former President, got what he wanted out of the State Department. That s the very opposite of evidence of quid pro quo. Vox has more detail:If this proves anything at all, it s that the media is certainly not in the tank for Clinton. Actually, it was Harvard who proved that back in July:A new report released this week by Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy found Clinton has received far more negative coverage than any other candidate in the race thus far. The study was based on an analysis of news statements from CBS, Fox, the Los Angeles Times, NBC, the New York Times, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post.According to the study, a whopping 84 percent of Clinton coverage is negative. At that time, just 43 percent of Trump coverage was negative. The New York Times article might not be absolute proof that the media is stacked against Clinton, but when people think of the mainstream media, they certainly are at the top of most people s lists. The New York Times supposedly sets the standard, and apparently the standard in this election cycle is to manufacture controversies that, with the teeniest bit of analysis, actually disprove the controversies. Yes, that s convoluted and confusing, but that s the only way propaganda like this works.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.

 WATCH: Right-Wing Pastor Falsely Credits Trump For Saving The Auto Industry In 2008,"Remember that time in 2008 when Donald Trump rode in on a white horse and personally saved the auto industry all by himself? Yeah, me neither. But one of his supporters thinks that actually happened.During an interview on CNN, Trump s favorite pastor, Darrell Scott, stunned former Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer and New Day host Alisyn Camerota by making that exact claim after trashing the Michigan city as a hellhole that only the Republican nominee can fix. Detroit is in bad shape,  Scott said.  It s in bad shape economically, it s in bad shape as far as crime is concerned, and so you have a candidate that s saying,  I want to improve the conditions of the city economically, I want to improve the condition of the city as far as crime is concerned    you can t turn a deaf ear to that, whoever it is. Archer took umbrage to Scott s characterization of the city and warned that voters should scrutinize candidates who make such promises, especially since Trump didn t give a damn about Detroit before his poll numbers imploded.Camerota asked Scott to continue, and when he did he gave Trump credit for something that President Bush and President Obama did in 2008 and 2009 respectively. You have someone saying,  I m going to be put in a position to help Detroit in the areas that it most needs help,  Scott went on.  He bailed out the auto industry. Yes, Scott really did claim that Trump save the auto industry at the height of the Great Recession.Of course, the record is crystal clear that President Bush signed the first bailout of Chrysler and General Motors. When President Obama took office the next year he did even more to help the American auto industry to stay alive and continue competing with foreign automakers.The auto industry is now fully recovered in this country and Donald Trump has absolutely nothing to do with it, something Scott realized moments later as he clumsily attempted to correct himself. I mean, he just, uh, he didn t bail out the auto industry,  Scott embarrassingly admitted.  What I m saying is, he had been working in relationship with the auto industry in order to stimulate the American auto industry. Here s the video via Twitter.Heated debate over Donald Trump s outreach to black voters https://t.co/sdqciImnC1  New Day (@NewDay) September 2, 2016Once again, a Trump supporter humiliates himself on national television by getting the facts completely wrong.

" Jared Fogle Sues Parents Of His Victim, Says It’s Their Fault She’s Screwed Up","Jared Fogle, the ex-Subway pitchman convicted of having sex with underage girls, is suing the parents of one his victims, claiming the girl s problems following the sexual abuse are their fault, not his. According to court documents that were filed on Thursday, Fogle is placing the blame for his victim s personal injuries and emotional distress squarely on the shoulders of her own parents rather than his own.The girl, who is listed as Jane Doe in court records, was secretly recorded undressing and bathing while she was in the home of Russell Taylor, who was a close friend of Fogle. Last year, Fogle pleaded guilty to viewing those tapes. He was eventually sentenced to almost 16 years behind bars for having sex with minors, as well as receiving and distributing child pornography. He was also ordered to pay $100,000 to each of the girls he had abused, including Jane Doe.In other words, there is no doubt of this pervert s guilt at this point.Earlier this year, Jane Doe sued Fogle for an additional $150,000 in damages related to his crimes against her. Fogle says her emotional distress isn t his fault at all. Nope. So who s fault is it? Her parents.In the lawsuit filed by Fogle, he alleges that the girl was depressed, had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, and was promiscuous long before he and his buddy decided to use her in their kiddie porn. He claims that Jane Doe s parents, named in court documents as  J.T. and B.T.  didn t supervise her properly. He added that mom and dad screwed her up with their own messy divorce and  abusive relationship. The outrageous and reckless conduct of J.T. and B.T. committed over a period of several years inflicted personal injuries, emotional distress and psychological injury on Jane Doe from which she will continue to suffer,  the document states.  B.T. and J.T., by their actions, caused Jane Doe to suffer from emotional distress and depression which then resulted in Jane Doe engaging in destructive behaviors, including, but not limited to alcohol abuse, substance abuse, self-mutilation, and suicidal ideation with regard to which B.T. and J.T. are liable. Because of this, Fogle is asking the court to hold Jane Doe s parents liable for their daughter s emotional distress and  all other relief the court deems proper.

 Legendary Humorist And Radio Host HAMMERS Trump In Devastating Open Letter,"Minnesota humorist Garrison Keillor just nailed Donald Trump in one of the best take-downs yet.Donald Trump is an insecure little man who thinks the presidency will finally make people respect him, and nobody made that clearer than Keillor, who wrote a column published on Wednesday that puts the Republican nominee in his place.Keillor begins by focusing on Trump s hat. The brim shadows your face, which gives a sinister look, as if you d come to town to announce the closing of the pulp factory,  he wrote.  Your eyes look dead and your scowl does not suggest American greatness so much as American indigestion. Keillor continued by pointing out that Trump has apparently been trying for his entire life to be liked and respected by the Manhattan elite.  The New York Times treats you like the village idiot,  Keillor wrote.  This is painful for a Queens boy trying to win respect in Manhattan When you came to Manhattan 40 years ago, you discovered that in entertainment, the press, politics, finance, everywhere you went, you ran into Jews, and they are not like you: Jews didn t go in for big yachts and a fleet of aircraft   they showed off by way of philanthropy or by raising brilliant offspring. They sympathized with the civil rights movement. In Queens, blacks were a threat to property values   they belonged in the Bronx, not down the street. To the Times, Queens is Cleveland. Bush league. You are Queens. The casinos were totally Queens, the gold faucets in your triplex, the bragging, the insults, but you wanted to be liked by Those People. This explains why Trump would throw his hat into the presidential ring. He is desperate for respect from his wealthy peers. Running for president is your last bid for the respect of Manhattan,  Keillor continued. If you were to win election, they couldn t ridicule you anymore. They could be horrified, but there is nothing ridiculous about being Leader of the Free World. You have B-52 bombers at your command. When you go places, a battalion of security guys comb the environs. You attract really really good speechwriters who give you Churchillian cadences and toss in quotes from Emerson and Aeschylus and Ecclesiastes. Keillor then went on to mock Trump over the bad month he had in August. The teleprompter is not your friend. You are in the old tradition of locker room ranting and big honkers in the steam room, sitting naked, talking man talk, griping about the goons and ginks and lousy workmanship and the uppity broads and the great lays and how you vanquished your enemies at the bank. Keillor concludes by pointing out that running for president is the hardest work Trump has ever done in his life and breaks the news to Donald that in the end he is going to lose and he won t get a damn thing he wanted. It s the hardest work you ve ever done. You walk out in the white cap and you rant for an hour about stuff that means nothing and the fans scream and wave their signs and you wish you could level with them for once and say one true thing: I love you to death and when this is over I will have nothing that I want. Donald Trump is currently imploding in the polls and his campaign continues fly off the rails even as he insists that he is winning and that everybody loves him.This is a man in serious denial and Keillor just hit him with the reality that he has always been a loser and will always be a loser.Featured image via Getty",News,"September 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Surrogate Warns Of ‘Taco Trucks On Every Corner’ If Hillary Wins (VIDEO),"MSNBC s Joy Reid filled on All In With Chris Hayes Thursday night, and she had a most interesting guest on. Reid was joined by Marco Gutierrez, founder of Latinos for Trump. The subject was Trump s immigration plan, but it quickly devolved into a situation of the man being racist against his own people.While trying to pimp and sell Trump s very hardline immigration stance, Gutierrez warned of his  dominant  and  imposing  culture, and how it will take over the United States if we don t do things Trump s way. He said: We need to understand this is a different time and we re having problems here. Reid, being the tough interviewer that she is, cut him off and asked,  What problems are you talking about? That s when Gutierrez responded with a shockingly racist stereotype: My culture is a very dominant culture. And it s imposing, and it s causing problems. If you don t do something about it, you gonna have taco trucks on every corner. This takes self-loathing to a whole new level. This poor guy has bought the anti-immigrant line about the brown people taking over America hook, line, and sinker. Sad, but true.As for the Trump campaign   they really need to start screening their surrogates before letting them loose on the airwaves. If they are looking to reach wider communities, this is definitely NOT the way to do it.Watching the exchange below:#TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner #inners pic.twitter.com/EEtCG5tWtV  All In w/Chris Hayes (@allinwithchris) September 2, 2016And here is the entire interview:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Clinton Camp Just Obliterated Trump’s ‘Shameful’ Excuse For Black Outreach,"Hillary Clinton s camp took aim at Donald Trump and his recent efforts to lure black voters into backing him, slamming his  minority outreach  efforts as  shameful, insulting and cowardly. Marlon Marshall, Hillary for America s Director of State campaigns and Political Engagement, released a statement on Thursday in response to the latest update on Trump s upcoming visit to an African-American church in Detroit. Not only will Trump not be speaking to the congregation, but the one-on-one interview he will be having with the pastor after the service will be carefully scripted. Donald Trump s latest gimmick to act as if he cares about the black community is downright shameful, insulting and cowardly,  Marshall wrote. After 14 months of neglecting us, Donald Trump is once again dodging substantive conversations and ducking questions about the issues that impact our community. Not surprisingly, Trump s ignorance on issues like the economy, criminal justice reform, the meaning of quality health care or systemic racism, has forced him to resort to scripted conversations and staged engagements with our communities. According to the leaked script, the questions that will be asked by Bishop Wayne T. Jackson will be written in advance and the GOP nominee s answers will be carefully prepared ahead of time as well. Marshall slammed Trump for this bogus attempt at  scripted  outreach to the black community. The problem is, our community can see through this: outreach to African Americans cannot be scripted; leaders ought to be prepared to address the hard truths about race and justice in our country,  Marshall wrote. And Trump s discomfort on addressing these issues only reinforces that he s unfit to be our president. Trump s so-called  minority outreach  has not been going over as well as he hoped. What was his master plan to woo black voters and make them forget that he is endorsed by the KKK? Tell them that their lives suck so bad already that they don t have anything to lose by voting for him. Gee, I simply can t imagine why bedbugs and the Bubonic plague are polling better than Trump among blacks and Hispanics right now.Featured image via Aaron P.

 Colin Kaepernick Is Not Alone Anymore – Fellow Athletes Join His Protest (IMAGES),"Colin Kaepernick has been taking a whole lot of heat since he made the decision to sit during the national anthem in protest of the way people of color are treated in the United States. On Thursday night, Kaepernick once again refused to stand while the Star Spangled Banner was sung, but this time, he wasn t the only one.Image via InstagramKaepernick was joined in his protest Thursday night by fellow 49er Eric Reid, a safety, who knelt beside the quarterback as the national anthem rang out through the stadium before they played the San Diego Chargers. Reid also serves as the representative for the player s union and has been supportive of Kaepernick all week, despite the uproar over his protest.However, it is not only his teammates who are joining Kaepernick s protest. Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane also sat while the national anthem was sung on Thursday night before the start of their game against the Oakland Raiders.Image via Instagram.The 49ers have played four exhibition games this year and Kaepernick has not stood for the national anthem at any of these games. Nobody seemed to notice until  his first game in uniform, which was last Friday. Kaepernick explained that he wasn t standing as a protest of the way the lives of minorities are continually snuffed out by those who are sworn to serve and protect them. He noted that the only consequence for these  murders  is a paid vacation. I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,  Kaepernick said.  To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. It is good to see other teammates and professional football players standing beside Kaepernick and standing up for all African American lives in America. Hopefully, their numbers will grow and they will continue to use the national platform at their disposal to help bring awareness to the systemic racism plaguing not only the country in general but the criminal justice system in particular.Kudos to you gentlemen. Kudos to you.Featured image via Instagram",News,"September 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump BANS Campaign Volunteers From Talking About Him FOREVER,"Campaign volunteers are key to a winning presidential campaign. Unpaid supporters are the most solid of true believers in a politician, and most campaigns would do anything to attract them and get them doing the grunt work that wins elections.Not Donald Trump.His so-called  ground game  of volunteers in swing states has been slow to catch-up with Hillary Clinton s massive operation that have been working to register voters and get them to the polls since before the primaries began last winter.But another reason Trump is behind the curve may be his own ego. It has come to light that as part of volunteering for Trump s 2016 presidential campaign, volunteers must sign an unusual non-disclosure agreement document that bars them from ever speaking about him:The Enquirer reports that the agreement  is a required part of the sign-up process for Trump Red Dialer, an online call system that connects volunteers for the Republican presidential candidate with potential voters,  and that a spokesman dodged a question about why they re necessary. We are running a state-of-the-art campaign for Mr. Trump that involves best-in-market volunteer platforms, and it is attracting thousands of volunteers who are tired of the same old Washington corruption and back room deals and are securing votes for a change in November,  Trump Ohio spokesman Seth Unger said.The contract specifies that volunteers could face financial damages if they violate the agreement by speaking about Trump. Similar agreements have been discussed before in the campaign, as one was apparently signed by former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. The extremely expansive terms of the agreement led to him losing a book deal, and he actually could face a major lawsuit   as another former campaign staffer did, later settled   if he even criticized the campaign as part of his work as a commentator at CNN.ThinkProgress reports that by comparison, the Clinton campaign doesn t require anyone to sign anything before working for the campaign as a phone banker. Sounds like they want to win, instead of stroking the candidate s ego.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Powerful Moment Between Biden And Protester Ends Up With Invitation Backstage (VIDEO),"While on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton in Ohio, Vice President Joe Biden was talking about the dangers of a Donald Trump presidency and what that would do to the average citizen.However, while speaking, a protester started shouting at Biden about the Iraq War. And while he could have simply ignored this protester or let the crowd drown him out with chants of  Hillary!  Biden instead hushed the crowd to field his question.After Biden answered the question, the protester, still upset, let the vice president know that his friend had died. This is when Biden says: So did my son. It was a poignant moment and one that let the protester know that Biden understands what it s like to lose someone so close to you. And in an additional gesture of empathy, Biden told the protester that if he s serious about asking questions in regard to Iraq and his friend, that he can come backstage and will answer his questions.This is why we love Joe Biden. He s a man of the people.Watch the moment here:Video: Biden stumping for Clinton in OH when man protests over Iraq War:  My friend died!

 There Was Something Weird About Trump’s Hair During His Embarrassing Mexico Trip,"Boy, wasn t Wednesday an embarrassing day for Donald Trump? Not only did the low-energy GOP candidate almost sleep through his joint press conference with our neighbor to the south s president, but he managed to get caught lying about wall negotiations  and, of course, he s been  repeatedly hammered by President Enrique Pena Nieto as he continues to lie about their encounter.All in all, Trump s decision to stop by for a photo-op in Mexico was a humiliating experience both for him and America as a whole   but more for him, as his temper tantrum about brown people that he thought was a policy speech managed to lose him numerous members of his National Hispanic Advisory Council. The amount of fail involved in this operation is almost enough to make one s hair stand on end.The internet has noticed something else that might be a little more embarrassing for him than the rest of his failure of a trip, based on his history of going insane over his hair. He forgot to take the bobby pins out of the wet albino muskrat that functions as his hair before stepping onstage.Here, have a closer look: O.K., what I do is wash it with Head & Shoulders,  Trump once told Rolling Stone when asked if he has a combover.  I don t dry it, though. I let it dry by itself. It takes about an hour. Then I read the papers and things. OK, so I ve done all that. I then comb my hair. Yes, I do use a comb. Do I comb it forward? No, I don t comb it forward,  Trump continued. I actually don t have a bad hairline. When you think about it, it s not bad. I mean, I get a lot of credit for comb-overs. But it s not really a comb-over. It s sort of a little bit forward and back. I ve combed it the same way for years. Same thing, every time. One thing that was missing from that explanation was the existence of bobby pins.If Trump can t be honest with us about his hair routine, how can we know he s telling the truth when he says brown people are coming to kill and rape us, or his tax returns are unimportant, or that he has the very best people who will do the greatest things?You can see it in this video, if you hate yourself: trump bobby pins by DailyPoliticsFeatured image via screengrab",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Dwyane Wade Has Some Choice Words For Trump After Tweet About Cousin (VIDEO),"Right after Dwyane Wade s first cousin Nykea Aldridge was shot and killed in Chicago, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump thought it was appropriate to bring the shooting back to himself and tweet out: Dwyane Wade s cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP! Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2016To call the tweet in poor taste would be a severe understatement.Now, speaking up about his cousin s death and the reaction from Trump is none other than Wade himself in an interview with ABC s George Stephanopoulos.Wade said: I was grateful that it started a conversation but on the other hand, it just left a bad taste in my mouth because of what my family is dealing with and what our city of Chicago is dealing with and it looks like it s being used as political gain. Which is exactly what Trump was trying to use it for. Not out of empathy for the deceased and her family, but rather to try to bring it back to himself somehow.Right after the incident that took his cousin s life, Wade took to Twitter to say  Enough is Enough  in regards to these senseless acts of gun violence.My cousin was killed today in Chicago. Another act of senseless gun violence. 4 kids lost their mom for NO REASON. Unreal. #EnoughIsEnough  DWade (@DwyaneWade) August 27, 2016RIP Nykea Aldridge  #EnoughIsEnough  DWade (@DwyaneWade) August 27, 2016The city of Chicago is hurting.

 Leaked Script Shows Just How Terrified The GOP Is About Trump Actually Talking To Black People,"So Trump is going to visit a black church in Detroit this weekend, but his campaign seems to be very uneasy about it. Why else would they script answers to the pre-selected questions that Bishop Wayne Jackson will ask him? Seriously. That s what they did. The New York Times obtained a copy, and it sounds nothing like Trump.It s not uncommon for campaigns to submit pre-written questions that they want a specific interviewer to ask. It is unusual, though, for a campaign to take this step, to say nothing of involving their party s national committee in the scripting process. Trump, lauded by the crazies on the right and his campaign staff as merely  freewheeling,  and  unscripted,  reverts into racism, sexism and childish personal attacks without scripts. Of course, that has the GOP terrified.The first question that Bishop Jackson will ask, according to The Times, is,  Are you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God? Trump has always had trouble with questions like that, seeing as how he s really not very Christian. He can t name his favorite Bible verses and has fallen flat on his backside when asked about his faith and the Bible. His scriptwriters hope to gloss over all of that with the following answer (if, indeed, it can be called that): As I went through my life, things got busy with business, but my family kept me grounded to the truth and the word of God. His family? Which of his three wives does that answer refer to? It s like they re trying to make evangelicals forget that he thinks wives are disposable.Anyway.They also want him to say: I treasure my relationship with my family, and through them, I have a strong faith enriched by an ever-wonderful God. Har de har har.Another question is,  What he would say to undecided black voters? This answer is more Trumpian, and less Christian than the previous because it ends with a silly lie of a boast: If you want a strong partner in this journey, you will vote for me. I will never let you down. By the way, my support is now up to 8 percent and climbing. Let s be clear: Trump s favorability rating with the black community had reached the lofty dregs of zero less than a week ago. But, this is the GOP. When the truth, or even distorted versions of the truth, don t work, lie. Then get all righteously indignant when someone has the gall to point that lie out.They want him to give this half-answer when asked what his vision is for the black community: If we are to make America great again, we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in this country,  and  I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance.' And they want him to avoid the word  racism  altogether, even though he s likely to be asked outright whether he s racist.Interestingly enough, that script isn t the only thing the campaign is doing to keep Trump from tripping over his own tarnished-silver tongue here. The interview will air on Bishop Jackson s television network a week after it takes place so the campaign has time to edit it.Yes, they want to be able to edit it. When Trump is reading prepared remarks, he either sounds lifeless and bored, or he goes off-script anyway. So they re prepping for that very strong possibility. They need this interview to reflect what the campaign wants, and not what Trump really thinks.In short, this is the GOP trying to spin Trump s racism into something grand and good. It s also nothing but a show   it s not a real attempt at outreach, and really, why should it be? The GOP is made up of racists who must cater to the racists. They re kin, after all.Featured image by Aaron P.

 White Supremacist Chases Down Black Teen And Kills Him In Oregon,"Just remember that white supremacists support Donald Trump and the Republican Party.Because if they take power in November, racists like this guy will think they have free license to kill black people at will.Earlier this month, Russell Courtier and his girlfriend Colleen Hunt stopped at a convenience store near Portland, Oregon and started a fight with 19-year-old Larnell Bruce, a young black man.Courtier has repeatedly run afoul of the law, but keeps being let out of his cage. While in prison, he became the leader of the European Kindred, a white supremacist group. Courtier had just been paroled for attacking a woman with a knife in 2013.Anyway, Courtier slammed Bruce s head into the glass window as Hunt cheered. To defend himself, Bruce pulled a knife and Courtier retreated to his Jeep. The fight should have ended there, but Courtier wanted blood, so he violated a series of traffic laws in an effort to run Bruce over.By the time police arrived it was too late. Bruce was severely injured and Courtier and his girlfriend had fled the scene. Bruce died days later at the hospital due to the severity of his injuries.Both Courtier and Hunt were later arrested and now they have been indicted for murder and will likely face charges for committing a hate crime.Frankly, this is one of those cases where law enforcement and our judicial system failed the public simply because Courtier is white. He has four felony convictions and seven misdemeanors on his record, yet he was still unleashed upon society. On the flip side, African-Americans are being shot by police in the streets for doing nothing criminal whatsoever. If Courtier were black, he d either be dead before he ever saw the inside of a courtroom or he would be imprisoned for life without the possibility of parole. He certainly would not have received as many chances for freedom as he has squandered.But Courtier is white, and now the Oregon judiciary has blood on their hands.What may be even scarier is the fact that white supremacists like Courtier are big fans of Donald Trump because they believe he ll make America white again and bring their racist cause into the mainstream.These are people who cheer for the killing of black people and are just waiting for the day when they can do so with impunity.If you want a glimpse of what Donald Trump s America would look like, the murder of Larnell Bruce by a white supremacist in the middle of an open street should tell you everything you need to know.Featured image via Multnomah County Sheriff s Office",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Madonna Has One Word To Describe Donald Trump’s Animal-Murdering Sons,"Madonna just called out Donald Trump s privileged sons and it s EPIC.The Republican nominee s sons Eric and Donald Jr. often go hunting for sport because that s what rich white assholes do with their spare time.In 2011, the douchy duo went on a safari and killed a majestic leopard that they held up like a trophy while getting their picture taken. They then posted the image on the Internet to brag about their kill because apparently they think killing an animal that is decreasing in overall population somehow makes them men.Well, Madonna has seen the picture and she is NOT impressed and she really only had one word to describe Trump s little boys. How Big of [a] Pussy Do you have to BE to kill this Noble Animal for sport?  Madonna wrote on Instagram along with the photo.  Just ask Donald Trump Jr and his brother Eric. Then she endorsed Hillary Clinton because she doesn t need to shoot animals to prove how tough she is.How Big of. Pussy Do you have to BE to kill this Noble Animal for sport? Just ask Donald Trump Jr and his brother Eric. One more reason to vote for Hilary! ???A photo posted by Madonna (@madonna) on Aug 31, 2016 at 11:23pm PDTAs mentioned above, the leopard population is decreasing and the species has been designated as  vulnerable  by the World Conservation Union, so the Trump s hunt is definitely something worth being enraged about. After all, we are witnessing a decline of many of the world s animal species and these two assholes are contributing to the problem.In addition, the brothers have killed elephants, which is an endangered species facing a catastrophic decline. And that s just the tip of the iceberg since there are photos of many other animals they have killed. Law enforcement might want to make sure two aren t serial killers, because killing animals is how that usually starts. Instead of spending their daddy s money on killing sprees, perhaps they should spend the money on making sure these animals are here for future generations to enjoy. But that would be asking a lot of these heartless pricks.Featured image via The Mirror",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Foreign Policy Guru: Jesus Says ‘This Is the Last Election’ If You Don’t Vote Trump (VIDEO),"Brace yourself for this, folks. Trump foreign policy adviser Michele Bachmann has just returned from Jesusland, that little imaginary country that exists in her head where her brain should be, with some dire news. Apparently, Supreme Overlord God Jergenson (we assume that s his last name anyway) is giving the people of the United States a choice between life and death this election, Trump or Clinton   and if we don t choose  life,  well, there just won t be anymore elections. Well, I don t want to be melodramatic but I do want to be truthful,  Bachmann says melodramatically in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network.  I believe without a shadow of a doubt this is the last election. This is it. This is the last election. And the reason why I say that David is because it s a math problem,  Bachmann tells interviewer David Brody.  It s a math problem of demographics and a changing United States. If you look at the numbers of people who vote and who lives in the country and who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to bring in to the country, this is the last election when we even have a chance to vote for somebody who will stand up for godly moral principles. This is it. Hillary Clinton  I m not judging her spiritually or where she is at but we know where she s going to come down on Supreme Court justices, she s pro-Planned Parenthood. She s for everything I m against. I think it s very clear. We ve got a day and night contrast,  Bachmann says.And, of course, she s right. Where Clinton is a classy, intelligent, grounded, sane human being, Bachmann is a vapid mess of a person who thinks The Lion King was gay propaganda and the Founding Fathers ended slavery (yes, seriously).Bachmann says she knows Trump can be a bit  crude  but urges people to  get over it  because Hillary Clinton is pure evil: This isn t even close between what Donald Trump stands for and espouses and what Hillary Clinton stands for and espouses. People look at Trump and he can be coarse and a little crude and all the rest and I say,  Get over it!  Get over it because what he is going to do is uphold religious liberty and advance the constitutional republic that our founders gave us. According to Bachmann, Clinton  has said herself that she is going to grant wholesale amnesty to people from the Third World who are here in the United States.  She says that the projected 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States is a  fake number,  then provided her own hipper, cooler fake number she got from Donald Trump    about thirty to forty million illegal aliens currently in the United States. What Hillary Clinton s ultimate goal is, is to secure her reelection,  Bachmann says.  The very first thing she will do as President Hillary Clinton is this: she will have a wholesale amnesty so that Republicans will never again have the chance at winning Florida or Texas. If we can t win Florida or Texas, it s game over.  From there, Clinton will  ensure  Republicans never win the White House by changing   the demographics of the United States so that no Republican will ever win again. But it s worse than that. A Trump loss would so displease God that he d just kill us all anyway to prevent a Clinton presidency: God says to every nation for all of time,  I set before you life and death, what are you going to choose?  If you look at the book of Genesis, you don t even have to get beyond Chapter 3 to see God gives us life. The first thing he gives mankind is life. What does man choose? Death. We choose rebellion and death. You go from Genesis all through the Bible to the book of Revelation; man stupidly makes the same decision over and over again by rejecting life and choosing death. What I m telling you is that s what we re looking at now in this country. I know all of this sounds scary, but choose  death  this November   unless, of course, you want to see the sort of  life  we would have under an insane racist who will likely throw us into nuclear war within his first 90 days.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Judge Rules That It’s Very Expensive To Be The Victim Of A Mass Shooting,"For years   if not decades   liberals have complained that the nation is on the verge of becoming an oligarchy, which in the most simplistic terms possible, means that corporations (and the wealthy) are more important than regular people. Well, a ruling in Los Angeles might not be the biggest or the most wide-reaching news story, but when a judge ruled that the victims (yes, the victims) of the horrific mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado would have to pay for the sins of daring to sue the movie theater, our wall between government and corporations crumbled even more.On July 20, 2012, an orange haired 24-year-old named James Holmes entered a screening of the Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises. He proceeded to set off tear gas and grenades before peppering the theater with hundreds of rounds of ammunition. He killed 12 and injured 70. At that point, it was the largest mass shooting in history. Holmes was sentenced to more than 3,000 years in prison, so there was some justice some The living victims of the shooting sued Cinemark Theaters, claiming that if they had had guards and better security camera coverage, the shooting might not have happened and even if it had, there might have been fewer casualties. They lost. Now, we can debate the validity of the lawsuit all day long, but to add insult to dozens of brutal injuries, the theater countersued, claiming that the victims owed them $700,000 in legal fees and court costs. The theater won. They now owe the theater $700,000.We can also debate the validity of this ruling all day long, but the bare truth is that Cinemark didn t need to sue. They were just being dicks. The shooting or the impending lawsuit didn t hurt Cinemark. Their annual revenues are just south of $3 billion a year and rising steadily. They could have easily eaten the legal costs with just a few concession sales (only a slight exaggeration).The worst thing this ruling did, other than re-victimize people who have to live with the traumatic memory and for some, permanent injuries, was to send a message. The message is that if citizens dare to stand up to their corporate overlords, we should be prepared to be slapped down hard and in the most expensive ways possible. Cinemark should have just let this go, but it was in their interest, like it s in the interests of large corporations throughout the nation, to let us know, in no uncertain terms, that we have no voice.Featured image via Bloomsberries/Flickr.

 IRS Slams Trump Foundation For Breaking The Law,"The Donald J. Trump Foundation just quietly paid an IRS fine for breaking the law. Trump paid the IRS a $2,500 fine after the Washington Post exposed that his foundation had broken the law by giving a political foundation to a group connected to Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.The improper donation, a $25,000 gift from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, was made in 2013. At the time, Attorney General Pam Bondi was considering whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. She decided not to pursue the case.Bondi s decision to let Trump University skate despite allegations of wrongdoing after the Trump donation has caused considerable controversy, with some demanding an investigation into possible corruption by the Republican attorney general.The Washington Post found that Trump didn t notify the IRS about his donation and it was recorded as a donation to a completely different organization.In that year s tax filings, The Post reported, The Trump Foundation did not notify the IRS of this political donation. Instead, Trump s foundation listed a donation   also for $25,000   to a Kansas charity with a name similar to that of Bondi s political group. In fact, Trump s foundation had not given the Kansas group any money at all.The prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an innocent-sounding but nonexistent donation.Trump claims that the misfiled donation was simply a mistake, but it fits into a pattern of Trump and his organization and so-called charities moving money around in a dubious fashion. An investigation by the same newspaper has tried to verify Trump s wild claims of charitable donations, but has so far been completely unable to do so.Earlier this year, Trump had failed to donate to veteran s charities, despite his promise to do so months ago. He only finally gave in and gave money to veterans after the news reports surfaced and politicians like Hillary Clinton attacked him for stiffing the organization.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Latino Adviser Severs Ties With The Campaign After Embarrassing Mexico Trip,"Donald Trump thought he hit a slam dunk with moderate and independent voters when he decided to visit Mexico. Pundits and right-wing demagogues declared it  presidential  and said the visit was proof of a  softening  on immigration.Then Trump went to Arizona, and well, that all changed.Instead of taking a  softer  approach to the issues of Mexico, immigration and illegal immigration, Trump launched into his classic talking points that a wall will be built (and that Mexico will pay for it), that the United States is being swamped with  30 million  illegal immigrants (even though that number is closer to 11 million), and that Mexican immigration poses the same threat as ISIS.Well the speech In Arizona was the last straw for one Trump adviser, Jacob M. Monty, who advises the Republican nominee on Latino issues, among other things.Just last week, Monty posted on his Facebook that Trump is  the only candidate who has the skill and will to work with Congress to improve security and deal compasionately with the undocumented population in the US. In a Facebook post on Thursday, Monty denounced Trump and severed ties after he refused to take his advice and instead pandered to xenophobia:And with that, another Trump staffer leaves do to the candidate s blatant racism, xenophobia and lack of respect for those who know what s best.Although Monty has not said who he will be supporting at this point for the presidency, Trump s camp should take the opportunity to truly reflect on who they want to vote for him: the angry whites that will vote for him regardless of how  soft  he goes on immigration, or conservative leaning Hispanic and Latino voters he desperately needs?Another public embarrassment for the Trump campaign couldn t have come quick enough. This Mexico trip certainly did not work out well in the candidate s favor.Thank you, Jacob Monty, for putting principle over party! Maybe this decision will have Trump s closest advisers thinking long and hard about how to pursue sensitive issues that affect millions of proud people.Featured image via Jacob M.

 WATCH: Hispanic Chamber Of Commerce CEO Calls Trump A Clown On Morning Joe,"Donald Trump is not going to like this at all.The Republican nominee s pathetic effort to draw Hispanic voters to his campaign has failed miserably, especially after his disastrous trip to Mexico and the immigration speech he made afterwards.Trump visited our southern neighbor to discuss the wall and who will pay for it, only to be told that Mexico will not pay for it. Defeated, Trump was so humiliated that he claimed there was no discussion about that particular topic, only to be embarrassed once more by Mexican officials when they called him out on his lie.In fact, Trump doubled down on his immigration plan, declaring that there will be no amnesty and that Mexico will pay for the wall.In other words, Trump still wants to deport 11 million people and is suggesting that he will somehow force Mexico to pay the bill for something they did not build nor support.And that s exactly why Hispanic Chamber of Commerce CEO Javier Palomarez went on Morning Joe on MSNBC on Thursday morning to declare Trump s campaign  done for  among the Latino community.Palomarez began by pointing out that net immigration across the Mexican border has basically dropped to about 20,000 people, which might as well be zero in a nation as big as ours. Then he revealed that the 20,000 are those who are leaving America instead of coming in. That blows Trump s entire premise for a wall out of the water.Joe Scarborough asked Palomarez what his take is on Trump s effort to have it both ways by suggesting that maybe he won t deport that many people while also repeating his draconian immigration plans to his racist conservative base. He s painted himself into this box,  Palomarez replied.  He s damned if he does, and damned if he doesn t. He really had to come back out and fire up his base, but in reality he hasn t done anything to help himself in terms of growing the number, so I think he is done for with the Hispanic community. Palomarez said that Trump will never see the White House without a decent portion of the Hispanic vote, and then he dropped the hammer on the Republican nominee with a single word of Spanish. I don t know if you guys speak Spanish, but I want you to remember this one word:  Payaso.  It means  clown.  This guy is a complete clown. Palomarez went on to say that Trump has  laid to waste  any outreach effort Republicans have made after the 2012 Election and  there s no going back. Here s the video via YouTube.There is no way Donald Trump can possibly make amends with Hispanic voters with two months to go. Any such attempts would be seen as desperation from a failing candidate whose poll numbers have only imploded since the RNC Convention in July.Hillary Clinton is poised to win the Hispanic vote by even larger margins than President Obama did in 2012, and Trump is so despised that his presence at the top of the ballot could be disastrous to Republicans down the ticket.It s too late to appeal to Hispanics for their votes, and Republicans know it. The only ones who don t are delusional Trump fans who really believe he is going to win the election and they are going to be devastated when the results are revealed on Election Day.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 MAJOR Latino Supporter Publicly Dumps Trump On CNN After Hearing Immigration Speech (TWEET/VIDEO),"While many racist Donald Trump supporters are praising the way the Republican nominee doubled down on his disastrous immigration policies yesterday in his speech, it has caused several conservative Hispanic supporters to rethink their decision to back the business mogul.Earlier today, Alfonso Aguilar, the president of Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, made a public show of withdrawing his support for Trump on CNN, and elaborated on a tweet that said he d felt  disappointed and misled  by Trump s immigration speech:TwitterOn CNN, Aguilar told host Carol Costello that this major immigration speech had cost Trump Aguilar s vote, as well as many other Latino supporters. When he became the nominee, I thought it was important to give him a second chance. I m terrified about Hillary Clinton. And so I decided to support him and I thought that we could work with him and the campaign to move him to the center on immigration. And the initial response was very good. Aguilar pointed out the inconsistencies in Trump s message, as well as the harsh policy Trump was pushing now: He said he was going to treat undocumented immigrants without criminal records in a humane and compassionate way, he said he was going to soften his position. And then we heard yesterday and I was totally disappointed, not surprised, but disappointed and likely misled. Because he gave the impression, the campaign gave the impression until yesterday morning that he was going to deal with the undocumented in a compassionate way. And in that speech, he s basically saying, we deport you or we self-deport you. It s even worse than what he initially proposed. Trump s speech was so offensive, that Aguilar is taking back his endorsement of Trump: So today I m saying, not only am I considering withdrawing my support, I m telling you today, I m withdrawing my support from Donald Trump. And it s not only me. Many like me think the same way. I m so sorry, I just can t be part of that. Trump has flip-flopped on immigration several times over the last few weeks, but it seems that for many of his supporters, this is the final straw. It s about time.Featured image via screenshots",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump’s Immigration Speech After Mexico Visit FILLED With Lies, Deceit, And Racism","After meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto (and lying about what was discussed), Donald Trump flew back to Phoenix, Arizona to deliver a 10-point plan on how to fix America s broken immigration system.As pointed out by the Hillary Clinton campaign, the speech was overwhelmingly applauded by the alt-right, including white nationalists David Duke and Richard Spencer, and closeted white nationalist Ann Coulter (who is apparently back on the Trump train).In typical Trump fashion, the immigration  proposal  was laced with lies, deceit, and rank xenophobia, with outright lies regarding President Obama and Hillary Clinton s determination to tackle the issue of illegal immigration.Once again, Donald Trump claimed that illegal immigration is as high as 30 million, saying,  honestly we ve been hearing that number for years. It s always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is. Considering Trump has been fact checked on this claim multiple times  with Politifact rating it as Pants on Fire   one would think the Republican nominee would have the sense to stick to what is fact. But then again, it is Donald Trump. The Department of Homeland Security, along with several independent groups, put the number anywhere between 11 to 12 million, give or take. Not one serious organization, meaning one with credibility, has published a report showing the number to be anywhere near the bloated 30 million Trump and his surrogates are pushing.It s much easier to convince people there s a bigger problem than there really is when you conflate the statistics to suit your political purpose, and no one understands this better than Trump   he conflates the statistics on America s tax rates, crime rate, terrorism rate, and unemployment rate.If there s one thing Trump is better at than inflating statistics, it s letting his supporters know that he, and only he, cares and can fix it. At the Phoenix rally, Trump used the opportunity to slam his opponents, saying  President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders Ah, yes, the  Obama doesn t care about America  shtick. A popular and sometimes effective rallying call of the right, Trump and his surrogates certainly know how to play into the hands of their rabid base, and they certainly knows how to play into the hands of their latent racial hatred of the President.If only it were true though.See, if the Obama Administration (which included Hillary Clinton his first term) really had a gross dereliction of duty of the kind Trump speaks of, it wouldn t have overseen the largest deportation force in decades, while simultaneously seeing illegal immigration numbers fall, very dramatically.Perhaps Trump should answer for the illegal immigrants he s hired to work here in the United States before he accuses anyone of  dereliction. In a speech that was really rhetoric and not all that much fact, Trump managed to get even that wrong when Trump claimed President Obama said climate change was a bigger threat than ISIS, China, Russia (which is ironic), and the 11 million illegal immigrants.First off, it was Senator Bernie Sanders who said climate change is the biggest threat to American security. Second, while President Obama has said that tackling climate change was an urgent threat to the United States, fighting terrorism and keeping Americans safe was the top priority.In fact, President Obama said, verbatim,  I ve got a lot of things of my plate, but my top priority is to defeat ISIL. What say you, Donald?Wednesday s speech in Phoenix was classic Trump   fluff, lies and fear mongering. A trip to Mexico that ended up being an embarrassment turned into a speech that fell on deaf ears (except for the white nationalists). This is the man Coulter compared to Churchill.Republicans have themselves a real winner.Featured image John Freso/Getty Images",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Trump Campaign Manager Lies About Abortion, So Anderson Cooper Humiliates Her With Facts On The Air","If you want to watch Trump s campaign manager crash and burn, this is the interview you ll want to see.Kellyanne Conway may be a new name and face to most Americans, but she has been peddling lies on behalf of Republican candidates for years now. She also been getting called out for it, too.In 2012, Conway attempted to defend Todd Akin of  legitimate rape  infamy on CNN during an interview with Anderson Cooper.During the interview when it came time for Conway to explain Akin s outrageous blunder, she tried to change the subject by spouting off a big abortion lie that sex-selective abortions are rampant in this country. You ve got all these little baby girls being killed just because they re girls in this country,  she said before citing Guttmacher Institute as her source.A shocked Cooper informed Conway that there s really no evidence that sex-selective abortions are occurring in the United States. But statistically, there s not really much evidence that that is actually occurring in the United States. Amongst some immigrant groups in small numbers it may be occurring but in no statistical measure is it significant. Conway insisted that she is correct and told Cooper to check her source.Here s the video of Conway s lie via YouTube.And that s exactly what Cooper did during the commercial break and when the show resumed he took a moment to thoroughly humiliate Conway with the facts. Before the break, Kellyanne, you mentioned the Guttmacher Institute information on sex-selective abortion in the United States. Here s what they actually say in a May 30 press release titled  Sex Selective Abortion Bans: A Disingenuous New Strategy to Limit Women s Access to Abortion. The study acknowledges the practice does go on overseas, as we mentioned, and perhaps in certain Asian-American communities in the United States in small numbers,  Copper continued.  But, quote,  In the United States, meanwhile, there is limited data indicating that sex-selective abortion may be occurring in some Asian communities. Although the U.S. sex ratio at 1.05 males for every female is squarely within biologically normal parameters.  So I just wanted to put that out there. Here s the video of Cooper smacking Conway down via CNN.In short, Kellyanne Conway got totally owned on the air for lying about abortion statistics.Clearly, when Donald Trump was searching for a new campaign manager he was looking for someone is lies and is allergic to facts like himself.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images ",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Host Calls GOP Out On Voter ID Laws And Conservatives Go INSANE (VIDEO/TWEETS),"It s always a good day when a conservative acknowledges how hateful and racist their own party has become, and decides to go anti-GOP for a few moments. Yesterday, that s exactly what Fox News host Shepard Smith did while he was reporting about how the Supreme Court ruled it would not to restore North Carolina s voter ID law for this upcoming election   a move that would undoubtedly be bad news for Donald Trump.As if that weren t a hard enough blow for conservatives, Smith didn t mince his words as he spoke about why the voter ID law existed in the first place   to prevent minorities from being able to vote. In a frustrated voice, Smith called out the Republican Party for its racist election strategy: North Carolina had put in one of those  You have to show an ID  rules which so often in Republican states are designed to keep some minorities from being able to vote, and they tried to reduce the number of voting days. The US Supreme Court says that will not happen. You can watch that brilliant moment below: You can only imagine how conservatives on social media reacted to this. Many of them accused Smith for being a  LIEberal  (liberal) and standing in the way of Donald Trump becoming president. Many of these tweets are so belligerent, it s hard to even read.TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterConservatives have every right to be afraid after the Supreme Court smacked North Caroline s voter ID law down   after all, Trump is polling HORRIBLY with minorities (he s currently at ZERO percent with African Americans). Now that the Republican party s plan to prevent minorities from getting to the polls has been ruined, conservatives are obviously terrified that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is going to win this election by a landslide.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 News Legend Dan Rather Just RAZED Trump’s Hate-Filled Immigration Speech,"Trump s first immigration speech following his humiliation in Mexico Wednesday was a bunch of sure-to-please-the-Klan hate speech mixed with a heaping spoonful of xenophobia and just enough mindblowing stupidity to make one wonder if he or she is hearing the things that were definitely coming out of The Donald s face-anus.Trump returned to his familiar message of  deport all the brown people,   no citizenship for any of them,  and even brought back a deportation force so strong, so powerful, that it could banish Hillary Clinton from these United States faster than you can say  Avada Kedavra. In the aftermath of what could possibly be Trump s most hate-filled speech yet, legendary newsman Dan Rather hopped on Facebook and set fire to all that is Trump.Rather noticed, as did we all, that Trump s supposed policy speech was light on the policy and heavy on the (hate) speech. He claimed it would be a detailed policy address, and yet from the start his tone was a seething, angry attack on what he described as a world of dangerous murderers and rapists who seem to be roaming  sanctuary cities,  Rather notes.  Focusing on a few isolated and already well-documented tragedies, he painted the entire undocumented world with the casual brush of violence. I expected a law and order theme, but not this level of searing rhetoric. Of course, I shouldn t have been surprised,  he continues.  Trump feeds off his crowds and they were giving it right back. It was ultimate in the  Us vs. Them  mentality. Real Americans vs. others. I frankly saw echoes of the George Wallace speeches from the 1968 campaign.  He goes on:The applause lines seemed like ready red meat for this crowd and I am sure for those who regularly watch Fox News. They were names and anecdotes that frankly will be unknown to most Americans. That s because Donald Trump s America does not comport with what many voters see in their own lives. It was an attack on  thugs  and those on  welfare . I suppose there was a structure to this speech. He would say  and 3 ,  and 4  as if it were a detailed list of proposal, but any sense of order was swamped by a tsunami of rhetoric and tone. But any details are beside the point. With a raspy roar, leaning over the podium, Trump delivered his message with glee   This is our country and we are being overwhelmed by hordes not fit to be in our country,  he says.  He suggested that  These People  are well known to law enforcement and could be rounded up with ease. It was a line that seemed more in keeping with the culture of the old East Germany than the United States.  We have got to have a county folks  he summed it up.  Under a Trump Administration it s called America first! Noting that it is a  fools errand  to attempt to fact check Trump s jumbled mess of a speech, he ends with a warning to all who read his words:Make no mistake, this was a toxic mix of jingoism, nativism, and chauvinism. Many of you would like to think, not in America, not in our country could this type of rhetoric gain currency. But in other countries, and in other times in history, we have seen the impossible become possible to horrific effect. Trump is betting his political future on this idea   that there is a deep, tribal, and dark sea of the molten lava of hate and aggrievement. This volcano from below appeals to dangerous instincts- can it yield a path to the presidency and power?Pay attention. Don t try to pretend  it can t happen again.  Don t stand up, stomp your foot and say  not in MY America.  And don t you dare say  we won t let it happen.  By ignoring Trump, or by pretending that he doesn t stand a chance to win, you re letting it happen.November 8   be there.Read his entire message below:Featured image via screengrab/Getty Images(Kirk Irwin)",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: This Priceless Video HILARIOUSLY Exposes Trump And His Doctor For What They Really Are,"Trust Funny Or Die to come up with something like this. They ve released a video starring Brent Spiner, a.k.a Dr. Okun from Independence Day, and Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation, and he (ahem) takes on a new role here to lampoon the hell out of both Trump and his quack of a doctor.Spiner actually introduces himself as Dr. Bornstein, and immediately launches into what he knows about Trump: I m making this video because there s something they don t want you to know. Trump s not from here! And I don t mean not from America, I mean not from this planet, okay?When I wrote that ridiculously glowing letter in five minutes, I thought you d see through it for the obvious farce that it was! Indeed, that letter has been the subject of controversy for Trump, seeing as how Bornstein used language that doctors generally don t use in it. He said that Trump s lab results were  astonishingly excellent,  for one thing. He also declared Trump the healthiest person ever to run for president, which is something he can t possibly know.Spiner hilariously touches on all of that, too, in his role as the infamous Dr. Bornstein. He then goes back into discussing Trump s alien anatomy: I did a chest exam, and to be honest, I was not expecting to find a heart, and guess what? I didn t! What  Bornstein  did find in place of a heart is even funnier than Trump s obvious lack of one. From there, it just spirals.

 Head Of Wikileaks Calls Hillary Clinton A ‘Demon’ Who Wants To Hang People,"Julian Assange, the founder and head of the group WikiLeaks, has struck out once again at Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. In an interview with the New York Times on Facebook Live, Assange described Clinton as a  demon. The American liberal press, in falling over themselves to defend Hillary Clinton, are erecting a demon that is going to put nooses around everyone s necks as soon as she wins the election, which is almost certainly what she s going to do,  Assange said in the interview, which was broadcast live Wednesday on Facebook.Assange s verbal attack is the latest episode of the organization lashing out at Clinton and the Democratic Party. WikiLeaks was used as the conduit for the release of thousands of stolen emails from inside the Democratic Party before the 2016 Convention. Those emails led to the resignation of the party chairman and several top officials and a rift between the DNC and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT).On the heels of that document dump, WikiLeaks also released documents stolen from Democratic lawmakers, including personal cell phone numbers for members of Congress like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and others, who reported getting sexist and racist phone calls as a result.WikiLeaks has even engaged in promoting conspiracy theories, floating the allegation that a Democratic staffer who was tragically killed in Washington, D.C. had some sort of connection to machinations by the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton.Originally the vehicle for documents on the Iraq war disseminated by Private Chelsea Manning, WikiLeaks has over the last few months pivoted to be a force opposing Clinton, aided by hackers like Guccifer, who have infiltrated multiple systems.A recent analysis has also found that the possible source of material stolen from Democrats and given to WikiLeaks were hackers connected to the Russian government. Assange has, in the recent past, hosted a television show on RT, the cable and satellite news channel financed by the Russians.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Just Personally Went On Twitter To DESTROY Trump’s Ridiculous Visit To Mexico (TWEET),"Donald Trump got to play make-believe on Wednesday afternoon as he went to Mexico to speak with President Enrique Pe a Nieto.Trump, who has absolutely no diplomatic experience whatsoever, apparently got cold feet when it came to his big, beautiful, great, wonderful, and spectacular wall he wants to build along the border between the United States and Mexico.It would seem the reality television star couldn t muster up the courage to demand Mexico to pay for it because Mexico s president said afterwards that he would never pay for the wall, and Trump, instead of saying that, decided to try to cover up the conversation by saying it never happened.Al inicio de la conversaci n con Donald Trump dej  claro que M xico no pagar  por el muro.  Enrique Pe a Nieto (@EPN) August 31, 2016Translated, that says: At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.

" Amid Accusations Of Hillary Selling Access For Cash, Trump Is Selling Access For Cash","Donald Trump has a new fundraising scheme. He s raffling off lunch with his son Eric and a tour of the Trump campaign headquarters. While this is pretty standard political fundraising fare, it does show how ridiculous and disingenuous Trump s latest attacks against Hillary Clinton actually are.The latest  revelation  about Clinton is that as Secretary of State, she sometimes held meetings with donors to the Clinton Foundation. She also often ignored the requests for meetings, which is completely overlooked by the right-wing press.Trump has taken the report and run with it, calling it  pay to play,  and noting that it s illegal. A couple of very bad ones came out, and it s called pay for play,  he said.  And some of these were really, really bad and illegal. If it s true, it s illegal. You re paying and you re getting things. Source: Politico Paying and getting things,  isn t illegal. That s called capitalism. Paying government officials to get things that only government officials can give   that s called pay to play and yes, that is illegal. There s no evidence that Hillary Clinton did that, unless you count an occasional meeting as  getting things.  Ask absolutely anyone in Hollywood what a meeting means; hell, ask Donald Trump what a meeting means, and you d find that with successful people, a meeting is as much a way of shutting people up as it is an exchange of ideas, let alone favors. Meetings never have and never will imply obligation.Now, let s talk about actual pay to play, the highly illegal type. Donald Trump has actually bragged about bribing politicians and judges. That s unethical at best and illegal at worst. I was a businessman,  Trump smarmed at a debate earlier this year. He was being pressed about the piles of dough he has deposited in Democratic coffers through the years   for his pals the Clintons (including the Clinton Ca-ching Foundation), Schumer, Reid, Pelosi, Cuomo, Rahm, and the rest of the gang. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. You know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them, and they are there for me. . . . And that s a broken system. Source: National ReviewYes, that is a broken system   one Trump is happy to keep broken.Oh, but it gets worse. Trump also allegedly bribes people, as he allegedly bribed people involved in the Trump University case.The trouble started in June, when the Associated Press reported that Bondi  personally solicited a political contribution from Donald Trump  in 2013 right around the time she was deciding whether or not to investigate alleged fraud at Trump University. Trump University, of course, is the controversial for-profit school owned by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.It was only four days after Bondi announced she might join an investigation into Trump University when a Trump family foundation gave $25,000 to a political group supporting Bondi s re-election. After that money came in, Bondi said she would not pursue a lawsuit against Trump University. Two years later one day before Florida s crucial primary election Bondi endorsed Trump for president.Source: Think ProgressThat, if it happens as alleged, is pay to play.

 Trump Campaign Manager And CEO Outed As Members Of A Secret Far-Right Extremist Group,"The Southern Poverty Law Center released a report on Wednesday, outing both of the newest additions to the Trump campaign as members of a secretive far-right extremist group made up of the most powerful conservatives and white supremacists in the United States.In what was described as a  shakeup,  Trump hired conservative pollster Kellyanne Conway and Breitbart bigwig Stephen Bannon as his campaign s CEO (Whatever the hell that is, since presidential campaigns don t have CEO s.)According to the SLPC s report, Conway and Bannon are members of the Council for National Policy (CNP). This right-wing group is known for its secrecy and is comprised of some of the country s most powerful conservatives. The CNP is an intensely secretive and shadowy group of what The New York Times once described as  the most powerful conservatives in the country,  reads the SPLC report. In addition, it is so tight-lipped that it tells people not to admit their membership or even name the group. Revealing when or where the group meets, or what it discusses, is also forbidden. The membership rolls also boast some of the most notorious white supremacists in the country as well. The CNP is not controversial so much for the conservatives who dominate it   activists of the religious right and the so-called  culture wars,  along with a smattering of wealthy financiers, Congressional operatives, right-wing consultants and Tea Party operatives   as for the many real extremists who are included. The report states that the CNP s members include  Michael Peroutka, a neo-Confederate who for years was on the board of the white supremacist League of the South; Jerome Corsi, a strident Obama  birther  and the propagandist hit man responsible for the  Swift boating  of John Kerry; Joseph Farah, who runs the wildly conspiracist  news  operation known as WorldNetDaily; Mat Staver, the Liberty Counsel leader who has worked to re-criminalize gay sex; Philip Zodhaites, another anti-gay activist who is charged with helping a self-described former lesbian who kidnapped her daughter from her former partner and fled the country; and a large number of other similar characters. Earlier this year, the SPLC got their hands on the CNP membership directory for 2014. This document showed that Bannon had been a regular member and Conway had served as a member of the group s executive committee. It is unknown what their current standing with the group is today.When the SPLC first published the original article on the CNP several months ago, they pointed out that it is very much within their rights to operate in secret. However, this means that the group  also provides an important venue in which relatively mainstream conservatives meet and very possibly are influenced by real extremists, people who regularly defame LGBT people with utter falsehoods, describe Latino immigrants as a dangerous group of rapists and disease-carriers, engage in the kind of wild-eyed conspiracy theorizing for which the John Birch Society is famous, and even suggest that certain people should be stoned to death in line with Old Testament law. The SPLC concluded that it is  not known how their contacts within the CNP may have affected Conway and Bannon.  But they reiterated what they wrote in May: At a time of extreme political polarization in our society, in the middle of an ugly presidential contest which has featured an almost unsurpassed record of ethnic, racial and sexual insults and lies, Americans deserve to know who their ostensible leaders are mixing with as we collectively decide our country s future. That is as true of campaign leaders as it is of political candidates,  the SPLC added.Trump has been trying to distance himself from the alt-right, the modern term for white supremacists, especially after Hillary Clinton gave a blistering speech calling out his ties with the fringe element. Bannon s connection to Breitbart has drawn scrutiny, as the blogspot is known for its racist, sexist, and anti-Semitic content. But from the looks of it, Trump and his campaign are sitting right in the laps of these right-wing extremists. Conway and Bannon s involvement with the CNP just made that abundantly clear.Featured image via Rawstory  and Liberal America",News,"August 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Trump’s Infantile Reference To His D*ck Size REALLY Shows Great Strength, Says Fox News","Fox News  resident doctor, if, indeed, he can be called that, weighed in on the ancient, but immature reference that Trump made to the size of his penis after Marco Rubio made a crack about his tiny hands during a debate in Detroit, Michigan. Keith Ablow, who really has some questionable things to say on the air, let loose with the following verbal rubbish heap: When the  small hands  issue was raised during the debate that supposedly got the Clinton campaign very excited, they thought  Man, he s off his game he wasn t off his game at all. Freud would have been standing up, like applauding. Standing ovation. Ablow the Blowhard went on with: To be able to address such an intensely personal issue and say,  Listen, there s no problem in that department,  to me, that showed an incredible degree of psychological strength. Or it showed an incredible immaturity   something that s only been solidified as this election cycle has gone on. Trump could have, and really should have, just ignored the jab about his hands. Instead, he said: Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands   if they are small, something else must be small.I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee you. Because self defense. He missed a golden opportunity to make Rubio look like an immature, tasteless idiot. As is so common with Trump, though, he slipped into insecure teenage-boy mode and bragged about his penis size, which is literally relevant to nothing. He proved he had even less class than Rubio when he did that.Watch Ablow s psychological gobbledy-gook below:Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"August 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mexico’s President Confirms Trump LIED: He Told Him To Go F*ck Himself And His Wall,"After his joint press conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Donald Trump told the press that the two had discussed his wall, but not who would pay for it.It was Trump s  easy out  on the issue   the ability for him to say that discussions on the wall were  preliminary.  While Trump may have been correct that the two nations respect the right of either nation to build a physical wall,  his claim that it wasn t discussed was, as is everything else he says, complete bullsh*t. The AP reports that Nieto has spoken out on the  wall  issue, and  Trump is surely furious. Pena Nieto says he told Trump that Mexico won t pay for border wall, contradicting Trump, who says it was not discussed,  the Associated Press  Twitter account shot out shortly after Trump s photo-op in Mexico was completed.BREAKING: Pena Nieto says he told Trump that Mexico won't pay for border wall, contradicting Trump, who says it was not discussed  AP Politics (@AP_Politics) August 31, 2016President Nieto was also very clear on the issue via Twitter:Al inicio de la conversaci n con Donald Trump dej  claro que M xico no pagar  por el muro.  Enrique Pe a Nieto (@EPN) August 31, 2016 At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump,  he said, I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall. The border wall has been the central part of The Donald s campaign since the early days when he called all Mexicans  rapists   drug dealers  and  criminals,  and pledged to build The Wall to keep the brown people from further ruining our Great White Nation. This promise has been an important part of growth with key Trump demographics like white supremacists, Klansmen, neo-Nazis, and closet racists.Unfortunately for the 2016 Republican nominee s followers, he appears to have all but given up on building their favorite thing ever.

 SCOTUS Won’t Uphold NC’s Voter Suppression Law And McCrory’s Whining Like A Spoiled Brat About It,"SCOTUS returned a split 4-4 decision on North Carolina s repressive voter ID law, which means the lower court s ruling that it s unconstitutional stands. North Carolina cannot use that law in November as a basis for turning people away from the polls, and, predictably, Governor Pat McCrory is unhappy with this. His statement on the matter reads more like a toddler whining about being punished for being bad than anything: North Carolina has been denied basic voting rights already granted to more than 30 other states to protect the integrity of one person, one vote through a common-sense voter ID law Even without any support from our state s attorney general, we were pleased that four justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, agreed with this right while four liberal justices blocked North Carolina protections afforded by our sensible voter laws. B-O-O H-O-O. Our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for this because McCrory s a delusional twit. Whose rights are being violated without this repressive law in effect? This law is what violates people s basic voting rights.The lower court held that this particular law was actually a voter suppression law, enacted with the intent to suppress minority votes. Why? Probably because North Carolina is a swing state, so every vote really does matter, and they can t have too many people voting Democratic, especially in a presidential year, now can they?No, they can t. Republicans lose power when too many minorities vote. The horror.What McCrory is missing is that, yes, 30 other states have voter ID laws of some sort, but several of those states have seen part, or all, of their laws struck down as well. Those states include North Dakota (home of the attempted six-week abortion ban), Texas, and Wisconsin. Other states Arizona, Kansas, Alabama, Virginia, Ohio and Georgia have litigation on their laws pending.SCOTUS hasn t ruled on all of these cases, and they may not, depending on what else there is to be heard from other states. To hear McCrory talk, however, one would think that all of the courts in the entire country had ruled specifically against North Carolina when other states must have worse laws. These laws don t protect  one person, one vote,  though. They protect Republicans.So what, exactly, did SCOTUS refuse to grant a stay on? North Carolina tried to tighten restrictions on acceptable IDs, for one. That inevitably harms poor minorities. It can also harm young people, who like to vote Democratic more than Republican.They also reduced early voting, another blow to the minority community; eliminated both same-day registration and out-of-precinct provisional ballots; and they eliminated pre-registration for 16- and 17-year olds that indicates an intent to vote when they turn 18.McCrory can cry about this all he wants   this is a major victory for everyone who believes in civil rights. The law will stay off the books for November, helping to keep the state in play for the presidential election, ensuring that many more voices are heard, and hopefully meaning that McCrory will lose his job.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"August 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Maine Gov. LePage Says He’s ‘Tired Of Being Caught,’ So He’s Never Speaking To Press Again","Maine Governor Paul LePage has made quite a name for himself with his casual, yet blatant, racism. But when someone calls him out on his bigoted remarks, he apparently gets his feelings hurt because he is such a  sensitive  guy underneath his hardened exterior. Well, what does he do when someone tells the truth and his feelings? Why, he throws a temper tantrum of course.LePage said on Wednesday that he was just downright crushed when he heard the news that Maine lawmaker Drew Gattine had called him a racist. Turns out this wasn t even true, but LePage, being ever so devastated that he was called a racist for saying racist things, decided to respond by leaving a voicemail for Gattine calling him a  c*cksucker  and a  son of a b*tch. Don t forget, though, Lepage is the one we should feel sorry for. He s the  sensitive  soul who just happens to say incredibly insensitive, racist stuff. But dammit, calling him a racist just goes too far. It hurts his feels! I may not supposed to be that sensitive to these things, but I am,  LePage confessed.  I lose sleep over this, and it s frustrating when you hear people talk about cheap political stunts to hurt their opponent and not do the right thing. Being called a racist was a horrible thing for me. It was enormously hurtful. It hurt my family. So just what does the good governor plan to do about all this? Maybe try to stop spouting all the disgustingly racist things that have a habit of pouring out of his mouth? Nope. He s sensitive. Just like a baby. So he s throwing a temper tantrum and has announced that he isn t going to talk to the press anymore so that he doesn t get  caught  saying these racist things. That ll teach the media! I will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,  LePage said.  And I m serious. Everything will be put in writing. I am tired of being caught   the gotcha moments. LePage made headlines when he said that all black people are drug dealers with names like  D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty  who come to his great state to  impregnate young white girls.  He has ranted about immigrants working in restaurants, saying he needs  an interpreter  to understand them. Then last week he declared that he is at  war  and naturally, he outright declared that blacks and Hispanics are the  enemy.

 Shocking Ad Shows How Trump’s Racist Campaign Is RUINING Children’s Lives (VIDEO),"We know without a doubt that Trump s blatantly racist campaign has had a massive effect on adults in this country. Suddenly, the bigots that were too afraid to voice their opinions aloud have found the courage to spew their hate speech openly and Trump has only encouraged more division and violence throughout America. But if you think that adults are the only ones being affected by this, you re wrong.Thanks to a new ad from progressive group Move On, we re able to see that Trump s campaign is taking a devastating toll on non-white and Muslim children, who are getting bullied in school. The ad, titled  Our Kids,  runs through several powerful news clips where minority children have been threatened or harassed by their white, racist peers who have undoubtedly latched onto Trump s messaging after learning it from their parents or from the media.In one news bit, white students were chanting Trump s name at black and Latino players during a high school basketball game in Chicago. In another, Latino students were humiliated when vandals in Oregon hung a banner that said, Build a wall.  One student who was interviewed in the clip said that Students don t feel safe. Students don t want to go to school anymore.  Another said, Lately, it s just been getting worse. This ad is less than 90 seconds long, but it perfectly sums up that the biggest motivating force behind Trump s campaign and its voters is racism, regardless of what Trump s surrogates try to say. Move On s ad gave viewers a brutal reality check when it said: Donald Trump is endangering our kids. Perhaps the next most powerful message in the ad was the call to action for adults to do something to protect all the children in the country. The ad said: Protect our kids from Trump s hate speech. Vote November 8th.

" Republicans Say Everything’s Terrible Because Of Obama, Show Them THIS And Shut Them Up","Republicans insist that everything under President Obama is awful and terrible and getting worse. Their nominee for the presidency has based his entire candidacy on the idea that America is a complete trianwreck and only he  alone  can fix things.But when you ask actual Americans about what their lives are like after eight years of Barack Obama being president, a completely different message emerges. Gallup did just that, in a survey of over 100,000 people, and almost completely across the board people feel better off than they did before.In 2008, fewer than half of Americans said their life was good enough to be considered  thriving,  according to Gallup. But that s changed:  The 55.4% who are thriving so far in 2016 is on pace to be the highest recorded in the nine years Gallup and Healthways have tracked it,  according to the report.The report even has findings that obliterate Donald Trump s constant harping that black Americans are living lives of complete desperation inside crack-destroyed inner city ghettos. The percentages of U.S. whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asians who are thriving have all increased during the Obama era,  Gallup notes. The percentage of blacks thriving has risen by about 6 points, as has the percentage of whites and Hispanics. Asian thriving has risen by about 10 points since 2008.It isn t magic or left wing propaganda. People simply feel better off and more optimistic, and it isn t a coincidence that this change has occurred between the presidency of a conservative Republican and a progressive Democrat.As a result, President Obama s approval rating has gone over 50 percent and reports are now emerging that Trump is having trouble convincing voters in key states that they need to turn the page from Obama because people are feeling positive about the situation in America.Ignore the hype and noise of the right, check out the data and you ll learn how people really feel.Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michele Bachmann Says Trump Is The GOP Nominee ‘Cause God™ Was Godding It Up,"Michele Bachmann is a special snowflake. If there is anyone who is crazier than Sarah Palin and Donald Trump, it is definitely her. Last week we learned that the former congresswoman is one of the people advising Trump on foreign policy because she knows soooo much about foreigners and stuff. She s an expert, she can see ISIS from her house .in Minnesota!Now this week we are learning the real reason good ol  Michele thinks the billionaire was chosen as the GOP nominee. During an interview on the Christian Broadcasting Network s show The Brody File she said: I actually supported Ted Cruz. I thought he was fabulous but I also see that at the end of the day God raised up, I believe, Donald Trump who was going to be the nominee in this election. I don t think God sits things out. He s a sovereign God. Donald Trump became our nominee.I think it s very likely that in the day that we live in, that Donald Trump is the only individual who could win in a General Election of the 17 who ran. Maybe I m wrong, I don t know but I do know that the Bible is true and that Daniel teaches the most high God, which is one of God s names, is the one who lifts up who he will and takes down who he will. OBVIOUSLY, the real reason Trump is trumping all over the place is because he is the chosen one. Why didn t we think of that? Hmmmmm .maybe because it is a batshit crazy way of thinking? Yep, that s it!As Wonkette (if you don t know who Wonkette is we highly recommend you check them out) points out, it is incredibly unlikely that Bachmann believes Obama is president because God   raised up  and had him elected; after all, the GOP seems to believe that God  only works for them.Michele clearly doesn t want to admit that the only reason Trump is the nominee is because he was the most racist of all of the candidates and the GOP base LOVES racists. They wanted a candidate who represented their beliefs that  the blacks  should still be drinking out of different water fountains and  the Hispanics  should pick vegetables and shut up. It had nothing to do with God  and everything to do with the disgusting rhetoric that his infected the minds of Republican voters.Featured image via T.J.

 WATCH: Trump Campaign Manager Blames Women For Rape,"Once again, a Republican rape comment surfaces, and it s from the campaign manager of the Republican nominee.Donald Trump s campaign has been full of sexism and misogyny, so it was only a matter of time before his third campaign manager Kellyanne Conway made her own offensive comment about rape.In 2013, despite Republicans being advised to keep their mouths shut about women and rape, Conway appeared in a panel discussion to talk about women in the military. At some point, Conway used rape as an analogy even though rape was not part of the discussion.Conway blamed women for being raped because they are not as physically strong as men and that  rape would not exist  if only women were not so weak. If we were physiologically   not mentally, emotionally, professionally   equal to men, if we were physiologically as strong as men, rape would not exist,  Conway said.  You would be able to defend yourself and fight him off. Here s the video via YouTube. Conway s rape comment is at the 2 minute mark.Conway s comment assumes that all rapes can be prevented simply by being physically strong. Unfortunately, rapists have many tricks to incapacitate their victims, including date rape drugs. Being strong also does not work very well if a rapist has their victim at knifepoint or gunpoint.Instead of blaming rapists, Conway openly blamed women for rape. She was a Republican pollster at the time, but now she is the campaign manager for the presidential candidate of the Republican Party.Clearly, Trump either did not vet Conway at all or he is okay with what she had to say about rape.But this adds to the pattern of Republicans blaming the victim instead of the rapist. For years, Republicans have been saying outrageous things about rape. Here s 40 of them.Trump is just another Republican in a long line of Republicans who apparently believe women are at fault if they get raped. His hiring of Conway clearly demonstrates that. They seem to think it s acceptable to blame rape victims for their assaults, deny women the right to control their own health care, and downplay sexual harassment in the workplace,  Daily Show creator Liz Winstead responded to Conway s remarks.  It s not.

" Florida Voters Kick Racist, Corrupt State Prosecutor Angela Corey Out Of Office","Yesterday, Florida voters headed to the polls to cast their votes in the state s primary election. Among those who won their primaries were, as expected, Democrats Patrick Murphy (Senate) and Debbie Wassermann Schultz (House) who won their perspective primaries as did Republican Senate incumbent Marco Rubio.However, there was one controversial incumbent who was sent packing. The State Attorney in Florida s Fourth Judicial Circuit Court encompassing Jacksonville, Angela Corey, was trounced by almost unknown corporate attorney Melissa Nelson, 64 to 26 percent.Here s why that s good.Angela Corey is, in the simplest terms, one of the most unethical, cruel, and heartless attorneys in Florida, and quite possibly the whole United States. An eye-for-an-eye Republican, Corey was notorious for charging children as adults in the justice system. According to Human Rights Watch, 75 percent of the young people who were charged as adults under Corey s watch ended up going to prison, and the disproportional number of these kids were black or Hispanic. These statistics prove to be the highest in the state. Contrast these statistics: Corey s jurisdiction incarcerated 1,475 juveniles in the Jacksonville area, compared to 34 in Miami-Dade (the most populated judicial district with higher rates of youth) during the same time period, 2009-2013.Corey was also the prosecutor who put Marissa Alexander in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. According to The Nation:Corey charged Alexander with aggravated assault, which carried a minimum sentence of 20 years in prison [Corey sought a 60 year sentence]. Her prosecution of Alexander spurred online petitions and protests from domestic-violence groups, who argued that Alexander was being overcharged for protecting herself. Alexander ultimately served three years in prison. In an interview, Corey told me that she didn t understand why her actions were  newsworthy,  arguing that Alexander had endangered her children, who were in the next room.  How am I the bad guy in that situation?  she asked.One of her cruelest cases involved Christian Fernandez, a 12-year-old boy of Hispanic origin who beat his 2-year-old brother to death, when she charged him as an adult. Ignoring his past of extreme abuse, Corey went ahead and and pressed for first-degree murder charges, which would have put him away for the rest of his life. Christian was reported to have shoved his brother into a bookshelf, injuring his head. Fernandez s mother, Biannela Susana, waited too long before seeking medical attention, and the boy slipped into a coma before dying. A little boy who unintentionally killed his brother was charged as an adult by a vengeful, power- hungry prosecutor. Luckily, Christian Fernandez will not spend the rest of his life in prison, pleaded as a juvenile to manslaughter and aggravated battery, and will be sentenced to prison until he is 19. In a bit of irony, Melissa Nelson was one of the attorneys who worked on Christian s case.If Corey had her way, this young boy would have never left prison.Then there was perhaps the most famous case of them all: the George Zimmerman trial. Corey of course blew it. While representing the state, Corey had Zimmerman charged with second-degree murder, which some felt was an intentional overcharge, and felt that manslaughter would have been better for a  guilty  verdict. Corey also came under scrutiny for withholding information in relation to data accessed on Trayvon Martin s phone. When it came to light that such information was withheld, Corey fired the employee responsible for releasing it. Attorney Alan Dershowitz also accused Corey of filing a false and/or misleading affidavit pertaining to the case, a charge that could have gotten Corey disbarred.Not only all of this, Corey couldn t even uphold ethical standards that are beholden to attorneys and those who are in office:Corey has struggled to rise above several controversies in the run up to the primary, some larger than others. She was accused of forcing her office staff to contribute to her campaign with their time and money. A group of lawyers accused her of voter suppression and criticized by a group of vets for an alleged distorted campaign ad.Corey also used $108,439 of taxpayer money to upgrade her pension plan, and $425,000 in bonuses for her office staff. Corey was able to maneuver around a Florida statute than bans such bonuses for public employees by claiming the disbursements were  one time  pay raises.So the state of Florida made the right decision in sending a racist, lying, thieving prosecutor packing. It remains to be seen how Corey s successor will handle cases regarding people of color and youth, but once crux of this race was ethics, and boy did Angela Corey lack any.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"August 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Mexico’s Former First Lady Rips Trump Visit, Says Mexicans ‘Repudiate’ His Hate","Mexico s former first lady, Margarita Zavala, wasted no time slamming Donald Trump, who is set to make an appearance in Mexico, visiting current president Enrique Pe a Nieto, who invited the Republican nominee.From her twitter, Zavala denounced Trump on behalf of the Mexican people:Sr. @realDonaldTrump aunque lo hayan invitado, sepa que no es bienvenido. Los mexicanos tenemos dignidad y repudiamos su discurso de odio.  Margarita Zavala (@Mzavalagc) August 31, 2016Translation: Sr. Donald Trump: although they have invited, know that you are not welcome. Mexicans have their dignity and repudiate hate speech.Needless to say, Zavala s tweet was met with praise from Mexican citizens and other Spanish speaking individuals, who like Zavala, were offended by Trump s never ending barrage of outrageous lies about their country.Zavala, whose husband is former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, served in the country s Congress in the 1990s and is reported to be running for President herself in 2018. She was the country s first lady from 2006 to 2012. Calderon made headlines earlier this year when he told CNBC that Mexico would not  pay a single cent for such a stupid wall. Zavala is right   Mexico denounces hate speech, and they especially denounce Donald Trump, whose favorability in the country is a whopping 2 percent. If Trump thinks the world doesn t respect us now, he should see how much we ll be hated if he wins.With President Pe a Nieto s approval rating at 23 percent, Mexico could very well find themselves electing their first female president, Margarita Zavala, in 2018. Imagine if the United States and Mexico, two close allies, both had strong female leaders guiding the conversation, breaking up the good old boys club, and strengthening Latin-American relations.With Mexico up in arms about Trump s visit (and rightfully so), the message has been sent: our allies south of the border appear to be With Her. And they appear to be with Zavala, at least on this issue.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"August 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rob Reiner Has The Best Response To Trump Going To Mexico,"Donald Trump is going to Mexico, the place where he thinks only some of the people are good but most are rapists and criminals.From the very beginning of his campaign, Trump has repeatedly insulted our southern neighbor, even going so far as to promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and claiming that he will force Mexico to pay for it.After the Republican nominee descended down an escalator to his podium to officially announce his candidacy last summer, Trump said this about the Mexican people. When Mexico sends its people, they re not sending their best,  Trump claimed.  They re bringing drugs. They re bringing crime. They re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. The statement drew outrage across the country and immediately alienated Hispanic voters.But now Trump s words are coming back to bite him in the ass.On Wednesday, Trump plans to visit Mexico and it gave director Rob Reiner the opportunity to hilariously turn Trump s words against him. Clearly we re not sending our best to Mexico,  Reiner wrote on Twitter.  We re sending liars. We re sending narcissists. We re sending sociopaths. Clearly we re not sending our best to Mexico. We re sending liars. We re sending narcissists. We re sending sociopaths.  Rob Reiner (@robreiner) August 31, 2016And this isn t the only time Reiner has slammed Donald Trump.During an appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher earlier this month, Reiner offered an explanation for why Trump is saying all of these offensive things. It s easy to behave this way when you re mentally ill,  Reiner said.  It s not like he s trying to lose. He can t help himself. Donald Trump is a racist who is incapable of keeping his mouth shut. He insults people wherever he goes and if he somehow avoids an international incident while in Mexico it would be miraculous.But this is Donald Trump we are talking about so get ready for him to embarrass himself and America.Featured image via screenshot",News,"August 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fmr. Mexican President: Trump Is Not Welcome In Our Country (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has decided to make his way down to Mexico on Wednesday for a meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto. For obvious reasons, this is a visit that is not being well received by the Mexican people. Trump s long history of insulting Mexico, its people, and Mexican immigrants in America has their community incensed at his nerve to show his face in Mexico City. Therefore, former Mexican President Vicente Fox has decided to weigh in on the situation.Appearing on CNN, Fox said: I m sure he s going to be rejected by everybody here in Mexico. We cannot accept this going on. And yes, it could be a desperate move.   To me, it is a desperate move on both sides. Fox went on to say that Trump  is not welcome to Mexico,  and continued: We don t like him. We don t want him. Fox also criticized current President Pena Nieto for entertaining Trump s visit: I think President Pena is taking an enormous political risk by hosting Trump,  going on to call Pena Nieto s decision a  big mistake.  Fox also straight   out apologized for the visit and the president s insistence on going along with it: I really apologize for our president taking this step forward. After that, Fox turned his attentions to Trump himself, and his many hypocrisies regarding the issues of immigration and trade: How can you believe him when we are hearing right now that he and his wife violated migration laws in the United States?How can he speak about trade war when he s manufacturing all his products for his business outside of the United States? It s absolutely incongruent, absolutely inconsistent. Fox then appealed directly to Americans, warning us of Trump s incompetence when it comes to being president: I just cannot envision him sitting on that chair that was the chair of President Washington, President Jefferson, President Kennedy, President Reagan   all the great presidents that nation has had.This guy is not up to be a president. Of course, Trump, unwilling to let any criticism go, actually tried to lie regarding a proposed visit with Vicente Fox. He lashed out at Fox on Twitter:Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the ""f bomb.""  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2016Fox fired back, though, setting the record straight:@realDonaldTrump, I invited you to come and apologize to all Mexicans. Stop lying! Mexico is not yours to play with, show some respect.  Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) August 31, 2016Fox is likely right. The Mexican people  have every reason to loathe Donald Trump. Trump, in all his arrogance, likely thinks that this visit with President Pena Nieto will mean concessions   and, dare I say it   a check for his border wall. None of that will happen, though, and hopefully Trump returns from Mexico humiliated, as he so richly deserves.Watch video of Fox s comments below:Featured image via Patrick T.

 Trumpkins Seriously Think Their Hero Will Return From Mexico With A Check For His Wall (TWEETS),"This is so horribly amazing that it defies description. Conservatives who have a bone up their asses about a southern border that s not nearly as porous as they insist actually believe that Donald Trump will come back from Mexico with a check for his border wall. Or, at least, a solid agreement for payment.They re on Twitter saying it. Even former members of Congress are saying it. Joe Walsh, who s a nitwit as it is, said that it would be  game, set and match  if Trump was able to accomplish that:You know, if @realDonaldTrump comes back from Mexico tomorrow with a big check from Mexico to pay for the wall that s game, set, match.

(@trex554) August 31, 2016That s an astonishing level of gullibility right there, but Trump is a demagogue and his loyal followers eat up every single one of his words. Even some conservative websites are peddling a lie that Mexico already agreed to pay for the wall: Because what s not written in this story is the Mexican political leadership arguing about the viability of the Southern Security Wall being built. They have conceded the most important aspect.The argument has moved beyond  will the wall be built,  and now is focusing on  who is going to pay for it.  The media will skip noticing that little nuance. The answer is that, if a President Trump even manages to get authorization for the wall, we will end up paying for it. Oh, sure, he ll claim that Mexico s paying for it with heavy tariffs and by ending NAFTA, and possibly other ways too, but the truth is that we will pay for it, since most of what he s saying about trade isn t likely to happen without him disbanding Congress.This would be hilarious if it wasn t so sad.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"August 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Neil deGrasse Tyson SCHOOLED Right-Wing Columnist So Hard He Quit His Job In Shame,"A right-wing radio host has called it quits after he got owned by famous scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson.Last week, Neal Larson learned the hard way that there are humiliating consequences for spreading satire as a fact when the famous scientist fact-checked him into oblivion. I ve listened to Neil deGrasse Tyson before,  Larson wrote in the Twin Falls Times-News criticizing the astrophysicist for performing some interesting mathematics in relation to the Olympic medal count.But Larson went beyond that by accusing Tyson of mocking a little girl for wanting to live on Jupiter. And what I observe is a smart guy who consistently enjoys asserting his intellectual supremacy over others more than he actually likes educating. In one of his worse moments, Tyson mocked a 12-year-old girl who suggested she d like to live on Jupiter. He ridiculed her in the midst of a crowd, then later, several times, on Twitter. That told me everything I needed to know about Neil deGrasse Tyson.For that moment he was just a horse s astrophysicist. Naturally, Tyson did a little research and then responded to Larson with some bad news. The  incident  with a 9yr old girl never happened. It looks to be a hoax. No such tweets ever existed on November 29th, 2015, or on any other day. So you abrogated your journalistic integrity by not verifying what you read in somebody else s article, before using it as a foundational pillar in yours. Tyson s response went viral and humiliated the hell out of Larson to the point where he is now throwing in the towel to end his stint as a columnist.In what is now his final column, Larson admitted that he was checkmated by Tyson in one move. The instant it was picked up nationally, I was checkmated,  Larson wrote before playing the victim.  I had no recourse, no comparable media platform at my disposal. It was as terrible and as helpless as you can imagine. Even more disappointing, a few people that I honestly thought were friends, shared online my unfortunate story with glee. Seriously? How about practicing what you conservatives constantly preach to the rest of us and take some damn personal responsibility for once? After all, you re the one who printed satire as if it were fact, Mr. Larson. A simple look at the original source of the story would have been enough to figure out that it was fake. And you fell for it because you lack journalistic skills and integrity, which makes me wonder why the hell the Twin Falls Times-News let you get anywhere near their newspaper.But despite apologizing to Tyson for the blunder and the slander, Larson continued playing the victim throughout his last foray in print news. For those in the national spotlight, this is probably old hat, but I wasn t equipped to handle the influx, logistically or emotionally,  Larson wrote.  If anyone had sent a kind word or more gentle and constructive criticism, I apologize because I probably missed it in the onslaught of hate. Again, you slandered a man in an attempt to tarnish his reputation, Mr. Larson. You re lucky he didn t sue your ass on the spot because he damn sure has a bulletproof case against you, and yet you think you re the victim here?Neil deGrasse Tyson is an internationally recognized celebrity scientist. Did you honestly think your accusation would not become national news, especially once your target debunked your claim with facts?Neal Larson brought this humiliation on himself and he has no one to blame but himself for negative feedback he received.Now if only Tyson would monitor Larson s radio show and debunk the bullshit he spews on the airwaves. Perhaps Larson would be embarrassed enough to quit that job and go into hiding permanently.Featured image via Addicting Info",News,"August 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 REPORT: Trump’s Modeling Agency Is A Cover For Human Trafficking,"The majority of Donald Trump s campaign is built on xenophobia, but while his supporters are ranting non-stop about immigrants, Trump himself is taking full advantage of the flaws in our immigration system   at least according to a report in Mother Jones, in which Trump is accused of human trafficking (my words, not theirs).Are those words a little harsh? Well, according to the report, Trump Model Management has been using foreign models who arrived on tourist visas, not work visas. Yes, that s a violation of federal law. It gets worse, though. The models are what could be considered indentured servants because much of what they make goes right back into the pockets of Donald Trump.Founded in 1999, Trump Model Management  has risen to the top of the fashion market,  boasts the Trump Organization s website, and has a name  that symbolizes success.  According to a financial disclosure filed by his campaign in May, Donald Trump earned nearly $2 million from the company, in which he holds an 85 percent stake. Meanwhile, some former Trump models say they barely made any money working for the agency because of the high fees for rent and other expenses that were charged by the company.Mother Jones interviewed three of Trump s former models, all of whom arrived in this country without proper documentation to be working at all. All of whom compared working for Trump to  modern day slavery.  Two of those models make the claim that the agency urged them to lie.Two of the former Trump models said Trump s agency encouraged them to deceive customs officials about why they were visiting the United States and told them to lie on customs forms about where they intended to live. Anna said she received a specific instruction from a Trump agency representative:  If they ask you any questions, you re just here for meetings. That s not all. The models complained that they were forced to share a two bedroom apartment with at least 10 other models, all at very inflated prices. Most of the models are under age: It is like modern-day slavery  (Canadian born model Rachel) Blais said, adding that  most of the girls in the apartment that were not American didn t have a work visa. We re hoarded into these small spaces,  Kate recalled.  The apartment was like a sweatshop. I was by far the oldest in the house at the ripe old age of 18,  Anna added.Source: New York Daily NewsA few months ago, the Daily Mail reported on a former model who claims that she should have earned $75,000 a year working for Trump s agency, but she took home less than $5,000 in three years. She s suing Trump s agency.It s even rumored that Trump s wife Melania came to the U.S. illegally.Neither Mother Jones nor the Daily Mail used the words  human trafficking,  but according to the United Nations, the definition certainly applies:While there s no evidence in the report of prostitution and definitely no evidence of removal of organs, there was almost certainly deception, fraud and exploitation. Trump would never get away with paying American models so poorly, which is exactly why he imports them.Next time you hear Trump and his supporters chant,  lock her up,  remember this story. Not only is Trump not fit to be President, he s not fit to be out of prison.Featured image via Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images",News,"August 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 One Of Trump’s Closest Allies Just Called For Banning Women And Poor People From Voting (AUDIO),"This is why no one should vote for a Republican ever again. Period.Donald Trump becoming president would be one of the scariest times in our history. And that s because democracy itself would be shattered if conservatives like Wayne Allyn Root have their way.During an interview with radio host Rob Schilling on Monday, Root, who is often the opening speaker and Master of Ceremonies at Trump rallies, openly called for stripping welfare and Medicaid recipients of their right to vote and said women who get  free contraception  should be barred from voting as well so that Republicans can win every election in this country by a landslide. So if the people who payed the taxes were the only ones allowed to vote, we d have landslide victories,  Root said,  but you re allowing people to vote. This explains everything! People with conflict of interest shouldn t be allowed to vote. If you collect welfare, you have no right to vote. The day you get off welfare, you get your voting rights back. The reality is, why are you allowed to have this conflict of interest that you vote for the politician who wants to keep your welfare checks coming and your food stamps and your aid to dependent children and your free health care and your Medicaid, your Medicare and your Social Security and everything else?Social Security should not, Medicare should not, because you paid into the system. But all the other stuff, all the other goodies, free Obama phones, free contraception, you know what, you can get them but you shouldn t be allowed to vote, it s a conflict of interest. Take that away, we d win every single election in this country. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch:This is definitive proof that Donald Trump is too dangerous to be be president. And it is proof that conservatives are hell bent on taking away voting rights so they can gain absolute power.But there s a big problem with Root s plan. You see, Root s idea is based on the premise that minorities and liberals make up most of the people who take federal aid.In reality, Republicans would be stripping their own constituents of the right to vote if they listen to Root.According to Pew Research, the states where the most Americans are on welfare are red states, including, Wisconsin, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, South Carolina, North Carolina, Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, Maine, and Arkansas. Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida, which are considered battleground states but are also run by Republicans, are also on this list.And why are these states on this list? The answer is because Republican economic policies like the one Wayne Allyn Root supports, have swept more and more people into poverty, thus increasing the need for food assistance.In other words, Root s plan would have the opposite effect because it would keep many conservatives from voting in red states, which would devastate Republican majorities in those state legislatures.Furthermore, as Right Wing Watch points out, women don t actually get  free  birth control. The insurance companies are mandated to cover contraception in their health plans. In short, taxpayers are not paying for it, the women are paying for it every time they pay their premiums. One would think a businessman like Root would understand that, but who ever said Root was a competent businessman. After all, he s hanging out with Donald Trump. But the idea that we should strip women of their right to vote just because they get contraception is outrageous. And now we can add another reason why women should never vote for Republicans.In fact, the idea that we should strip any citizen in this nation of their right to vote is an affront to democracy and should by all rights lead to a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton in November.In other words, it s time to vote like it could be the last time we ever get a chance to do so, because if Republicans like Root have their way, it will be.Featured Image: Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"August 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 House Conservatives Planning To End Paul Ryan: ‘You Got To Stab Somebody’,"House Speaker Paul Ryan may have been hoping to be re-elected come January, but thanks to his fellow conservatives it looks like he doesn t have a chance. In fact, House GOPers are actively conspiring against Ryan to make sure that he doesn t succeed.Although these anti-Ryan conservatives don t have enough votes to oust their current Speaker of the House, they are plotting a coup movement to stop him from being elected again   a move that could very well have an even bigger impact on his political career further down the line. As a conservative member explained to The Huffington Post: If he loses the speaker election, he s not going to be president. In a nutshell, Ryan s fellow conservatives are trying to kick him out of his position because he s not being the kind of  conservative  they want him to be. Republicans really know how to stick together in a time when they need unity to save them from Donald Trump s circus.Of course, this would be completely humiliating for Ryan and even if his conservative haters couldn t indefinitely prevent Ryan from getting on the ballot for re-election, they might use this leverage to get certain changes made for their own benefit. The Huffington Post explained that these GOPers are looking for increasing caucus representation on committees, bulking up subcommittee staff with hard-liners who could be groomed for election, allowing the GOP House campaign arm to collect contributions for the Freedom Caucus that could be directed to conservative candidates, and clarifying rules-suspension votes. And some of these House conservatives are just plain furious that the GOP has taken on more moderate candidates   and they re taking their frustration out on Ryan. One member explained this by using an extremely inappropriate, strange analogy: How can you have a gang, and have one in your gang get stabbed, and do nothing? You got to stab somebody, or else what s the point of having a gang? Ryan has been House Speaker for less than a year, and his party is already going public with plans to oust him. This just shows what a mess the GOP is right now. Their Republican nominee is the worst thing to happen to the party, and this is further proof that the GOP as we know it is dividing and falling apart.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"August 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Marco Rubio Really Wants To Win Reelection, But Won’t Rule Out Puling A Sarah Palin (VIDEO)","Marco Rubio hates his job. Last year, he said he wasn t going to run for reelection because he was  frustrated.  He also had one of the worst attendance records in the Senate. Now, Rubio wants his job back, but, as if his voters haven t been screwed enough from him, he won t promise he ll finish his term out.In an interview Tuesday, CNN s Manu Raju asked Rubio if he would commit to serving the entirety of his term, to which the Florida Republican said: No one can make that commitment because you don t know what the future s gonna hold in your life   personally or politically. I can commit to you this,  Rubio said.  That if I am running to be a U.S. Senator, I am fully prepared to allow the U.S. Senate to be the last political office I ever hold. Source: Independent JournalHere s the video:.@mkraju to Marco Rubio: can you commit to serving a full 6 year term?Rubio:  No one can make that commitment https://t.co/q5Lh26jjed  Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) August 30, 2016Rubio s seat is important to both Republicans and Democrats. It could help turn the balance of power one way or another and despite Rubio s horrible tenure and his ambivalence toward the office he s trying to hold, Democrats are facing an uphill battle.Right now, two Democrats are eyeing the Senate in Florida, former Rep. Alan Grayson and Rep. Patrick Murphy. It s expected that Murphy, the more centrist of the two candidates, will win the nomination, but the election is another story. So far, Rubio is handily winning in most polls. Two show him within the margin of error.This fact is kind of amazing, considering Rubio has the absolute worst attendance record in the Senate.Of course, that might actually play well with his anti-government base, who would seemingly rather elect someone who s just a placeholder and an obstructionist, rather than someone who actually does his job for the people of Florida. This is why this country can t have nice things   literally.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images.",News,"August 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Newt Gingrich Attempted To Stiff Small Businesses, FEC Shot Him Down","Newt Gingrich, former House Speaker and now Trump-surrogate, apparently pulled a page out of the Republican presidential nominee s playbook when he attempted to stiff over 144 businesses (including dozens of small businesses) who helped him with his 2012 failed presidential campaign.Gingrich, who owes over $4 million in campaign debt, recently filed documents with the Federal Elections Commission to effectively detail a debt settlement that would end his presidential election committee, thus allowing him to escape paying the millions back to creditors and consultants who helped his campaign.Many of these small businesses manufactured lawn signs and organized TV spots for the Republican candidate, who four years later would be runner-up on Donald Trump s V.P. slot.Luckily the FEC wasn t having any of it rejected Gingrich s debt settlement, saying that his plan does not  meet the requirement  under federal election law because it  contains no debt settlement agreements and must continue to file all required reports.  So instead of the FEC taking action right now, Gingrich will have to complete the entire process of debt settlement plan procedures.Gingrich, who is worth anywhere between $7 to $30 million, has some nerve stiffing small business owners when they poured their resources into his failed presidential campaign. Perhaps this is why Trump didn t pick him: they both have gotten flak for stiffing honest, hardworking business owners.It s time Republicans take responsibility for their actions and pay their debts. While busy running small businesses into the ground, they have the gall to stand up on stages and podiums and proclaim to be saviors of small businesses.So many people have been hurt at the hands of Republicans, it s hard to keep track. But this election has shown the American people one thing: Republicans do not pay back their debts, and they will crush anyone to save a buck.Hopefully, the FEC denied Gingrich again and forces him to pay back his debts to those who helped him. If he were an honest conservative (fiscal responsibility?), this wouldn t even be an issue in the first place.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"August 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Supporter Calls For Sending Black People Back To Africa,"Donald Trump s pathetic outreach effort to sway black voters into supporting him just took a major hit.Just when you thought Trump and his supporters couldn t say anything worse to offend black people, a North Carolina pastor who supports the Republican nominee just pitched a  let s send black people back to Africa  plan reminiscent of similar ideas racists have had throughout American history.During an interview with CNN host Carol Costello, Thomas Rodgers, Sr. of Antioch Road to Glory International Ministries advocated on the air for  returning  black people to Africa to get jobs building a road to the United States across the Atlantic Ocean.Rodgers claimed that African-Americans  do not seek dual citizenship  and said that is why black people join gangs. Oh, he also says black people have  no vision  and  no leadership. African-Americans are the only people in the world who do not seek dual citizenship. That s why Chicago gangs, California gangs, the Crips and the Bloods and Detroit in Michigan   we have gangs in the streets because blacks have no vision, they have no leadership. Costello then asked Rodgers to explain his idea to build a bridge to Africa, and that s when the interview completely went off the rails. Matter of fact, where our ancestors came from, from the Indian Ocean all the way across the Atlantic Ocean, that s 4,000 miles and we want to go back and help with the highways all the way across, to create jobs, train rails, pipelines, oil, petroleum. They create jobs for young people that can t find jobs here, that the Democrats have not did. Of course, the unemployment rate in the black community dropped to 8.2 percent under the policies of President Obama, a Democrat and it was 6 percent under Democratic President Bill Clinton. So Rodgers is wrong on that point.A confused Costello asked,  So you are suggesting young people in trouble should go back to Africa, perhaps to find jobs? Rodgers argued semantics, claiming that he is just calling for black people  to return  to Africa, which is basically the same thing as going back, just using a different wording. And then he claimed that black people don t want to stay in this country. It s a clause in the United Nations charter, our right to return, to help build infrastructure. Everybody don t want to stay here. We are skilled people. Rodgers  remarks drew laughter from strategist Angela Rye, whose facial reactions while Rodgers spoke were the same that every normal person watching at home were making, pointed out that building a literal bridge between the United States and Africa is impossible.Here s the video via YouTube.The suggestion that black people should be sent back or  returned  to Africa has been around for a long time, particularly by white supremacists who want to turn America white again, which is why they support Donald Trump.It s offensive and suggests that black people are not capable of living in Western societies.The fact is, however, that systemic racism in this country has held African-Americans back and that is what needs to change. Black people do not need to be sent back anywhere. The system just has to be fixed so that it benefits everyone equally.Rodgers  remarks should guarantee that Republicans never get a vote from a black person ever again.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"August 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Poll Shows Growing Number Of Republicans Don’t Think Trump Is The Best Option For The GOP,"With 70 days until election day and Hillary Clinton still up (significantly) in the polls, it appears Republicans may be doubting who they chose as their presidential nominee.According to a new poll released from HuffPost/YouGov on Monday, 54 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said Donald Trump is not the best nominee for their party. That number is up 10 points since this question was last asked in June, when 44 percent said he was not the best option. Monday s poll also showed that only 35 percent of Republicans were satisfied with Trump being the nominee, down from 44 percent in June.However, Republicans feel they are stuck. When asked if they could have a do-over in the primaries, only 39 percent said they would choose someone different. Ted Cruz, Trump s closest rival, garnered 15 percent among responders, with Marco Rubio coming in third at 14 percent, and the rest of the candidates divvied up among 10 points. Twenty-nine percent said they would still have backed Trump.In contrast, 53 percent of Democrats who were polled are content with Clinton being their party s nominee, while 37 percent do not.Republicans, you reap what you sow. It must suck to have a candidate throwing an election away, killing the party  chances of taking back the House, and making a mockery of the United States abroad. The GOP made their bed and now they are going to lie in it.With the Senate and Supreme Court hanging in the balance for Republicans, Trump has continued a campaign of foot-in-mouth, angering many right-wing diehards like Ann Coulter and Sarah Palin for a supposed  flip-flop  on immigration, while simultaneously keeping moderate Republicans at arm s length.In other words, the GOP is having a complete meltdown. Trump, once seen as the conservative savior for the Republican Party, is not hated by factions on both sides of the ideological coin.Featured image via Stephen Maturen/Getty Images",News,"August 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GOP Already Planning To Obstruct Clinton On Everything,"Republicans are holding up Merrick Garland s nomination to the Supreme Court under the completely B.S. guise of  let the next president choose. Well, if the next President of the United States is Hillary Clinton, there s a good chance Garland (or a different nominee should Clinton pick someone to Garland s left) won t be confirmed.Republicans, 70 days out from the election, are already plotting to obstruct everything Hillary Clinton wants to accomplish, starting on her first day.A recent report for Politico details the Republican Party s  wake up call  to Clinton, with one Republican staffer saying,  her four years will look a lot like the last six years of Obama.  That same staffer, who is apparently  influential  in Congressional proceedings, quipped,  She s talking about things the president couldn t get done; why does she think she will have more luck? After saying things like  I will be president for Democrats, Republicans and independents,  and telling Trump-weary Republicans that they have a home in the Democratic Party, the GOP responds with nothing but what they know best: obstruction.Republicans are already planning on unleashing a new line of obstructionism: pitting Democrats against Clinton.Republican operatives on the Hill, for instance, are already planning to block Clinton s agenda by strategically targeting individual Democratic senators who will be up for reelection in 2018. Take Joe Manchin in West Virginia,  explained one GOP operative of the strategy.  If Hillary puts up an anti-coal, pro-EPA judge for the Supreme Court, the smart play is to start pressuring him with an advocacy campaign to vote no.  Voting with Clinton would jeopardize his reelection chances, and voting against her would rob her of a Democratic Senate vote she couldn t afford to lose without the 60 votes needed to filibuster.So not only can Republicans NOT win on their ideas, they have to coerce Democrats to turn against their own or else they face the wrath of Koch-backed money pouring into midterm elections.The next time a Republican blames Washington s gridlock and hyper partisanship on the Democrats, kindly remind them that Republicans were the ones who met on President Obama s inauguration night to oppose him, and are now pledging (before the election is even over) to obstruct Hillary Clinton.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"August 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: White Racist Tells Black Quarterback To Stand For National Anthem Or Lose Citizenship,"Glenn Beck stooge Tomi Lahren thinks that citizenship in this country requires that we always stand for the national anthem and respect the flag, even though we have the right to not do either.But the whiny white racist took to Facebook on Monday night to lecture San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and threaten his constitutionally protected citizenship because he chose to sit during the national anthem on Friday in protest of police brutality against black people. I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,  Kaepernick told the press.  To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. Kaepernick is following in the footsteps of athletes like Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson, and like them, he has been viciously attacked by racists like Lahren for drawing attention to the plight of African-Americans in this country. Colin, if this country disgusts you so much   leave,  Lahren said.  I guarantee there are thousands and thousands of people around the world who would gladly take your spot, because those that don t live under this flag are banging on the door to get in, not get out. Remember that. Except that Lahren and her conservative allies have actively supported Donald Trump, who has called for building a wall to keep Latinos out of the country and called for banning Muslims from immigrating here. So when Lahren says  thousands of people  you gotta wonder exactly what people she is talking about. All people or just those with white skin who practice Christianity?Lahren then got personal and demonstrated why black voters will never vote Republican. What s your contribution? Sitting there like a fool?  Lahren viciously continued.  What s selfish is you, buddy. And what s your message to black kids, to people of color? That their biggest contribution to justice and self-fulfillment is to parade around with a chip on their shoulder like a victim? Basically, Lahren is saying that fighting for civil rights and equality means that black people are playing the victim because people like her think racism doesn t exist in America.And then she lectured about how white people are not to blame for problems in black communities, even though white lawmakers established systemic racism that has lasted for decades in order to keep black Americans at a disadvantage compared to their white counterparts. Once again, Lahren got personal. Colin, how dare you sit there and blame white people for the problems (in) the minority communities?After all, aren t you half white? Didn t two white parents adopt you after yours weren t willing to raise you? For a racist and horrible country filled with racist and horrible white people, that s really something, isn t it? Here s the video via Facebook:Of course, Kaepernick never specifically blamed white people for anything in his remarks. He is simply speaking out against police brutality against black people, something that has become an epidemic in this country.But you won t hear Lahren talk about police brutality. She thinks the police are totally justified when they shoot black people and has said police will keep killing black people until they stop protesting.This vile piece of trailer park trash has been on the air long enough. It s one thing to have an opinion, but when that opinion is ignorant and hateful it should not be allowed to spread like the plague to poison other minds.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"August 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CNN Guest SMACKS DOWN Trump Supporter For Racist Gun Violence Comments (VIDEO),"Infamous Donald Trump surrogate and supporter Scottie Nell Hughes thought she was going on CNN yesterday to make yet another pathetic attempt to get African-American voters to support The Donald (even though he is currently polling at ZERO with black voters)   but her plans quickly went astray when political strategist Angelia Rye called her out for defending Trump.Cooper began the segment by running a few emotional interviews featuring three black women who had lost their children due to gun violence. In making her completely flawed case, Hughes told host Anderson Cooper that Trump would be able to bring  hope  to black communities as well as jobs. She said: It s these urban areas, 44 cities, where crime is going up as well as gang violence. So there s an issue that needs to be addressed by those kinds of   those communities, and they need to be supported whether it s through law enforcement or education. Rye didn t hesitate to point out everything that was wrong with those comments, and drop a few truth bombs in the process. Rye jumped in, pointing out that Trump and his supporters are so racist they hardly realize it: A couple of things. One is   gun violence specifically   the overall crime rate has been on a steady decline since the 1980s. But I think that it s really important to watch the words that we use. When we say,  Those communities, those people,  who are we talking about? Referencing one of the interviews that had prefaced the conversation, Rye echoed a woman s doubts that Trump could really take on Chicago s crime in  a week,  like he says he can. Rye also reminded Hughes that Trump has had zero empathy for the black community and those who have been killed by police brutality, racial profiling and gun violence.

 Trump Is LITERALLY Polling At 0% With Black People (IMAGE/VIDEO),"Donald Trump s recent African-American  outreach  efforts seem to have been wasted. Sure, he basically spends his time talking to white people about black people rather than actually visiting black communities, and that might not be the most effective use of his time, but as his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski points out Trump doesn t actually feel safe around  the blacks,  as he calls African-Americans.Monday night, Public Policy Polling released a preview of a new poll that lets people know exactly how well screaming at white people about black people sits with the African-American community. And as Rachel Maddow revealed on her show, it doesn t seem to work very well. Trump is polling at an astounding 0% favorability rating with African-Americans with a whopping 97% unfavorability rating (though the 3% undecided, of course, might allow him to pull himself up to a whole 3%).New PPP poll released on @maddow right now  TRUMP FAV/UNFAV with African American voters is:Fav: 0%UnFav: 97%Undecided 3%  Jesse Ferguson (@JesseFFerguson) August 30, 2016The poll, which was conducted August 26-28 and has a margin of error of +/- 3%, also asked African-Americans to compare Trump to a number of things generally detested by society. He lost to personal injury lawyers, middle seats on airplanes, carnies, Ryan Lochte, junk mail, mosquitoes, the Bubonic Plague, and even bedbugs.The good news for Donald Trump in this PPP exclusive? Lots of opportunity for growth!#Maddow#BrightSides pic.twitter.com/6g5pny5usq  Maddow Blog (@MaddowBlog) August 30, 2016Overall, the poll shows Clinton leading Trump 42-37%, with Gary Johnson snagging 6% and Jill  Moon Beam  Stein somehow earning 4% of the vote and 10% undecided.Trump isn t exactly known for his love of African-Americans. Not only have his inflammatory remarks cemented him as the  KKK candidate,  but he actively practiced housing discrimination against black people, reportedly ordered all black people off the floor when visiting his businesses, argued in 1987 that five innocent black teens accused of rape should be executed (in fact, he took out a full-page newspaper ad to make this case), complained about  black guys counting [his] money,  has repeatedly questioned President Obama s citizenship, and much, much more.More recently, he has portrayed African-Americans as individuals with  no education  who are jobless with  no homes  who live in  war zones. His recent  outreach  efforts have been dismal as well, with The Donald seizing upon a NBA star s family member s death to say that the murder will cause Black people to vote for him:Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2016While Trump doesn t much talk to black people enough to know how much they hate him, The Star spoke to some African-Americans in Philadelphia, and they aren t exactly fans: Extremely insulting. And I think purposely insulting,  said lawyer Rasheedah Phillips, 32. He s getting the ships ready. He wants to send us back over to Africa,  said Douglas Skipworth, 33, who does maintenance work. Black folk aren t fooled by this thing. African-Americans are clear about who Trump is,  said professor Anyabwile Love, 41, watching his 2-year-old son.  Many other elections, local and national, it s been the lesser of the two evils. In this, it s not even lesser of two evils. It s one is completely against us and one is not. Trump has a historically dreadful approval rating with black voters, as low as 1 per cent. But as he frantically attempts to convince white people that he is not a racist, black people have suddenly become central to his message.Which black people believe is racist.[ ] I haven t been shot. I got an education,  said Donte, a 17-year-old high school student.  Or   Ihave an education. Just in case he hears this. The contempt was strong. Navy veteran Rodney Thomas, 50, said he stopped paying attention to Trump long ago, his mind made up, for this reason:  I hate stupidity.

 FBI Finds Evidence That Foreign Hackers Infiltrated U.S. Election Systems,"Another day, another foreign hack into America s electoral system. This time, the hackers aren t targeting the Democratic Party specifically, but rather the state elections systems in an attempt to disrupt the General Election in November.According to the FBI, intelligence officials have sent out warnings, titled  Targeting Activity Against State Board of Election Systems  to state officials, claiming that cyber intrusions at the hands of (allegedly) Russian state-sponsored hackers have penetrated the election systems, with independent reports concluding that among the states affected were Arizona and Illinois. The FBI told  NEED TO KNOW  state officials that they have obtained evidence of  exfiltration,  which is the theft of voter registration data, among other offenses:In the Illinois case, officials were forced to shut down the state s voter registration system for 10 days in late July, after the hackers managed to download personal data on up to 200,000 state voters, Ken Menzel, the general counsel of the Illinois Board of Elections, said in an interview. The Arizona attack was more limited, involving malicious software that was introduced into its voter registration system but no successful exfiltration of data, a state official said.The FBI bulletin posted is requesting that  states contact their Board of Elections and determine if any similar activity to their logs, both inbound and outbound, has been detected. The FBI was able to determine that the hacks were foreign based on eight separate IP addresses that were linked to the sources of the hack, with two of them coming from Russian-backed hackers flagged in the past.Although not coming to any conclusions as of yet, Ken Menzel, the general counsel of the Illinois Board of Election, said the FBI, while certain it was foreign, are still trying to find a possible link between this and the Russian-based group found to have breached the DNC.How interesting that these possible breaches are coming once again from the Russians, after the links between their cozy relationship with the Trump campaign (and Trump asking for hacks) have been exposed. Considering Trump feels the election will be  rigged  against him should Clinton win, it would come as no surprise if these hacks had something to do with making sure Trump has a comfortable win.Trump, are you sure hackings are the way to go this election?",News,"August 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Fans Were Scammed For Over $1 Million, And The Donald Is ANGRY","The Trump campaign is hopping mad over an unaffiliated super PAC that used the lure of a dinner with Donald Trump to take in over $1 million from unsuspecting Trump groupies. The super PAC, American Horizons PAC, set up a website at dinnerwithtrump.org and told Trump fans that their donations would enter them into a drawing to eat dinner with the reality TV star and Republican presidential candidate.In reality, the drawing   set up by 25-year-old Ian Hawes, simply offers tickets to an already existing fundraiser for Trump. There is no guarantee that the winner would get to actually meet Trump, a stipulation hidden on the website in very fine print.Furthermore, documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission by the PAC showed that much of the money being donated is going to a company affiliated with Hawes, and not to Trump or other Republican candidates. It is the latest in what has been described as a  scam PAC  that is so prevalent on the right.The Trump campaign has now issued a cease-and-desist letter, attempting to stop the PAC. You are knowingly defrauding every person who gives you his or her email address or who makes a donation through your unauthorized website,  reads a letter from Trump s campaign attorney, Donald McGahn, to the super PAC.The PAC was able to take advantage of the fact that Trump and the Republican Party have been woefully unprepared for the election. They haven t spent much of the money they ve received on TV ads or organizers in key states, nor have they clearly indicated a preference for a super PAC for well-heeled Republicans to donate to. As a result, these fly-by-night PACs have sprung up and using advertising on Facebook, Google, and cable news (mostly Fox News) they are able to tap in to angry Trump voters who think they re donating to help the Donald and take down Hillary Clinton.Like so much associated with Trump, it s turning into a mess.Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WikiLeaks Has Sunk To New Journalistic Lows – They’re Bribing People For Dirt,"It s not illegal, but it s long been considered unethical for journalists to pay their sources. It still happens, but generally by tabloids. WikiLeaks  Julian Assange believes that his is not a tabloid, and in fact, he believes that he is so far above mainstream media sources, that it s okay for him to pay for stories, which is exactly what he s doing, trying to dig up dirt on both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Police rewards product results. So do journalistic rewards,  a spokesperson for Sunshine Press, of which Wikileaks is a project, told Huffington Post in an email.  Those who take the truth seriously leave no stone unturned to find it. As for the ethics, well, WikiLeaks breaths rarified air: Some lesser publications have poor quality control and as a consequence are not able to maintain accuracy when financial incentives are involved. Or frankly, even when they are not,  the spokesperson said, pointing to the New York Times publishing false information about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction as an example.  WikiLeaks  vetting process is strong enough not to be affected by an increase in source contributions. Wait, what? WikiLeaks has a vetting process? This is the same organization that published more than 80 strains of malware in its most recent email dump. Oh, and there s a reason they re called email dumps   WikiLeaks doesn t vet, they simply dump, leaving other journalists to sort through to find the real information. While the New York Times certainly doesn t deserve the level of respect they had before the Iraq War, I can say with certainty that they ve never infected my computer with malware.This isn t the first time WikiLeaks has paid to play. Last year, they offered $100,000 for information relating to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Earlier in the month, WikiLeaks offered $20,000 for anyone with information that might link the murder of a DNC staffer in Washington D.C. to the Hillary Clinton campaign. All they ended up doing was fueling Alex Jones-type conspiracy theorists.Assange has received a lot of criticism from those on the left, claiming that he s trying to put his thumb on the scale of our electoral process in an attempt to defeat Clinton. I m sure his claim that he s also going after Trump is a convincing cover for that, but think about it. Assange is offering $100,000. Trump could easily double or triple that to keep someone quiet. Yes, the Clintons have money, but not Trump money.Featured image via Carl Court/Getty Images.",News,"August 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Maine GOP State Senator Sick Of His Bullsh*t Demands Censure Of Governor Paul LePage,"Republicans in Maine tolerated Governor Paul LePage and his offensive words and actions for a long time, but now they are finally sick of him.LePage has constantly characterized blacks and Hispanics as drug-dealers and  the enemy  but it was a voicemail message he left for Democratic state Rep. Drew Gattine that finally caused Republicans to say enough is enough. I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you cocksucker,  LePage said.  I want to talk to you. I want you to prove that I m a racist. I ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. You   I need you to, just friggin    I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you. Clearly, LePage lost his sh*t in this message and actually threatened a member of the state legislature.That s a line too far, says Republican state Senator Amy Volk.Volk is so disgusted with LePage that she is seeking a censure, which is a formal resolution expressing severe disapproval that will be on the record. Up until this point, I have refrained from publicly criticizing any of the governor s behavior both out of respect for the office and a desire to preserve a working relationship with him and his staff,  Volk explained.  But this latest and the unwelcome attention it has brought to our state is a bridge too far. My understanding is that it would be by a vote of the legislature that it s sort of an official reprimand entered into the record so you know some sort of displeasure with the governor s behavior,  she added.A censure is a pretty big deal, especially when it s being called for by a member of the governor s own party.Frankly, LePage should have been censured and impeached a long time ago.After all, his outbursts and damaging decisions have embarrassed the state so much that Maine s largest newspaper actually apologized to the nation for him ever being elected to begin with. Dear America: Maine here,  the Portland Press Herald began: Please forgive us   we made a terrible mistake. We managed to elect and re-elect a governor who is unfit for high office. He has a gruff exterior and blunt way of talking that some of us find refreshing, but he has shown again and again that he governs by grudge, and uses his power to beat up on people who cannot fight back. Unfortunately for Maine, unless Republicans grow a spine and impeach their inflammatory governor they will be stuck with him until 2019, giving him plenty of time to humiliate himself and the state even more than he has already.Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Andrea Tantaros Dares Fox News To Take Lie Detector Test Over Sexual Harassment Allegations,"Andrea Tantaros is ramping up the pressure on her former employers and colleagues to answer for their behavior and face the consequences.Earlier this month, the former Fox host declared war on the conservative network by slapping them with a sexual harassment lawsuit which names Bill O Reilly among other such as Roger Ailes and Bill Shine.According to the lawsuit, Fox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny. Indeed, Tantaros says she was never allowed to wear pants on set and that Ailes seriously creeped her out on multiple occasions by obsessing with her legs and asking her to spin around for him so he could ogle her. When refused to comply with his outrageous demand he retaliated by firing her from The Five and placed her on a lower rated show.Top executives attempted to pay Tantaros off if she would drop her allegations but she turned the offer down.Fox News has denied the allegations, of course, but that isn t stopping Tantaros from charging ahead.Buzzfeed reports that Tantaros is upping the ante by daring Fox News personnel to take a lie detector test and offered to take one in return so that it can be determined who is telling the truth and who is lying.It s a brilliant move on Tantaros  part. If Fox declines it can be assumed that they have something to hide, like guilt. It would also vindicate Tantaros and give further credence to her allegations.Tantaros even released the questions she wants certain Fox News personnel to answer.For instance, a series of questions for Roger Ailes will seek to determine if he did, in fact, say inappropriate things to Tantaros in the workplace or if he ever retaliated against her for refusing his advances.Here s an image of the questions via Buzzfeed Editor Kyle Blaine.A series of question posed to Ailes  replacement Bill Shine includes whether or not he knew about Tantaros  complaints about Ailes and whether or not someone within the company arranged for negative comments to be spread about her on social media.Questions for Fox News Executive Vice President Dianne Brandi inquire if she had knowledge of Tantaros  complaints about the hostile working environment and if Fox has paid money to more than six women to settle sexual harassment suits.And finally, questions for Irena Briganti and Bill O Reilly include whether Briganti helped Ailes retaliate against Tantaros and whether O Reilly hit on her and made inappropriate comments about her.Tantaros  lawyers go on to state that  an innocent person would jump at the chance for this kind of vindication  and added that their client would  not risk offering this proposal  if she  were not telling the truth. To put it bluntly, Andrea Tantaros is taking her feud with Fox News to whole new level and these questions are damning all on their own without Fox answering any of them.For years, Fox News treated women like powerless sex objects. Now they are finding out just how powerful women can be, especially when they are pissed off about being treated like shit.Featured image via screenshot",News,"August 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Racist Donald Trump Actually Has The NERVE To Speak About March On Washington Anniversary (TWEET),"Monday, August 29, happens to be the 53rd anniversary of the Civil Rights March on Washington, in which civil rights icon Martin Luther King, Jr. made his iconic  I Have a Dream  speech. It is a landmark point in the history of Black Americans gaining legal civil rights. Therefore, the last person who should be speaking out on this event is the racist Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. But, speak out he did, and he actually had the unabashed gall to try and pretend he cares about equality. Here is the tweet:Today is the 53rd anniversary of the March on Washington   today we honor the enduring fight for justice, equality and opportunity.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2016Now, you must understand, Donald Trump has a long and well-documented history of racism. Here are just a few of those instances:I could go on, but you get the picture. This guy is a dyed in the wool, bona fide racist. He DARES to try and say he cares about equality and justice for minorities, but clearly, he doesn t  just look at his actions, the bigoted nature of his campaign, as well as the people he surrounds himself with. Further, his so-called  outreach  is only Trump s attempt to be a white whisperer to those white people who are too uncomfortable to vote for him if they sincerely believe him to be a racist. Newsflash, folks: Donald Trump IS a racist. His history and the nature of his campaign shows it. He s only pandering for votes because he knows he cannot win in November with only white people. Do not be fooled   Trump is a racist demagogue, and no amount of attempting to pander and change his language changes that.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"August 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Sarah Palin Faceplants, Immediately Starts Speaking In Tongues About Hillary (IMAGE)","Half-term Governor of Alaska and professional grifter Sarah Palin faceplanted while  rock running  so naturally, she took to her Facebook account to bash Hillary Clinton. Sarah seems to think that Hillary is in hiding and she links to several Breitbart posts to prove it. Stop laughing. She s super-serious. We re not going to link to the Alt-Right site but those links are on her page.Sarah somehow connected her accident to Hillary Clinton. Leave Hillary Alone, Bullies,  Sarah sarcastically writes in her post. Aww, c mon guys, give her a break. Anyone can be out of commission . for weeks on end  whilst in the heat of battle for the highest office in the land. No press conferences for nearly a year?,  she continues.  No scheduled campaign events for days upon days? No statements, no answers, no accountability, no problem. Layin  low to run out the clock before November, but you re SEXIST for noticing it. And you re MISOGYNIST for questioning a female s fitness. Good thing media didn t hound the crap out of  08 candidate John McCain for his decades-old military medical records or I d guess them to be hypocrites,  she writes, with no respect for the English language. Leave Hillary alone! All that email-evidenced yoga, and wedding planning, and cookie-baking-grandma-duty wears you out. Believe you me,  she states. Seriously though, is that an actual sentence? Heck, even those of us claiming to be fit as a (seasoned?) fiddle, hit bumps in the wellness road. Even I. Especially I. (Remember Piper s middle name is  Grace ; mine isn t.),  she writes. Rock-running recently, I tripped over my own two feet and crashed & burned face-first. I recovered with the doc s SuperGlue, and now any man who asks  what happened?  I ll refer to as just a mean ol  SEXIST bully,  Palin continues. Glad for Hillary s protective media s precedence. The next woman running for POTUS has no need to answer to much of anything, for we ve got weddings to plan, and Down Dogs to do, and cookies in the oven! So just leave us alone, boys,  she concluded. We do not speak Turnip at Addicting Info, so it s beyond our capabilities to translate that psychotic woman s Facebook-babble. Sarah Palin is wrong and if she could master Googling then she d learn that Hillary Clinton has a full schedule ahead of her. Every single day. Sarah is feeding the conspiracy theory that Hillary is  unstable  and needs assistance walking up stairs.  The fact is, Hillary slipped while walking up the stairs. You know, sort of how Sarah Palin slipped while  rock running. Speaking of hiding, where are Donald Trump s taxes?We hope Sarah feels better, though.

" WATCH: Mika Brzezinski Turns The Tables On Trump, Wants His Psychological Health Examined","Donald Trump picked a fight with the wrong woman.Even though the Republican nominee claims to not watch Morning Joe on MSNBC, it s pretty clear that he does based on the Twitter tantrums he has been throwing in response to Mika Brzezinski.Brzezinksi has been very critical of Trump recently and her criticism continued on Monday after former physician Howard Dean called Trump a classic narcissist.Unlike Trump and his team, who have spewed unfounded claims about Hillary Clinton s health, Brzezinski called for mental health professionals to evaluate him because he sure seems to be exhibiting tell-tale signs of being a  psychopath,  a term former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe used on Sunday during an interview with Chuck Todd. It s time to hear from somebody in the mental health community, to look at this person who has been on television for months and to give us a sense of what we have going on here,  Brzezinski said.  And, I m sorry, let s just not let s stop pretending we re dealing with someone who we can completely understand. When you see someone who you think has problems, you know it. And there s not anybody at this table who doesn t think he has some sort of problem. Let s ask the questions. Let s do this at this point. Let s set up someone and ask the   questions. Does anyone think that s completely outlandish and only because I have some sort of weird, snarky slant to it and I want to be smart? I think there s an issue there. Joe Scarborough pointed out that it might be more accurate to call Trump a  sociopath,  but said  a psychiatrist cannot come on and diagnose somebody. Here s the video via Twitter.Plouffe brands Trump as a  psychopath  The #morningjoe panel reacts. https://t.co/wbCipJ4P5z  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) August 29, 2016But Trump has already drawn some mental health professionals to publicly weigh in with their own evaluations, most notably Dr. Drew Pinsky and Fox News pundit Charles Krauthammer.On CNN, Pinsky said: The question, though, is, are some of the reckless qualities that everyone is getting so disturbed about on the campaign going to be translated into office should he get elected? That s a pretty hard thing to predict. I don t know if this is just somebody playing politics, or is this somebody who really can t contain their impulses? When I hear people that are impulsive with their speech, I worry about hypomania and bipolar types of conditions. And in a column earlier this month, Krauthammer, who is a board-certified psychiatrist, wrote that  Trump s hypersensitivity and unedited, untempered Pavlovian responses are, shall we say, unusual in both ferocity and predictability. This is beyond narcissism. I used to think Trump was an 11-year-old, an undeveloped schoolyard bully. I was off by about 10 years. His needs are more primitive, an infantile hunger for approval and praise, a craving that can never be satisfied. He lives in a cocoon of solipsism where the world outside himself has value   indeed exists   only insofar as it sustains and inflates him.

 CNN Guest Drops Truth Bomb About Who Trump’s Minority ‘Outreach’ Is Really Aimed At (VIDEO),"After working for months to build a solid white supremacist base, Donald Trump suddenly started focusing on minority  outreach  last week. But CNN commentator and New York Times columnist Charles Blow explained just who these efforts are really aimed at, and it isn t African-Americans.According to Blow, Trump s minority  outreach  isn t aimed at people of color at all. Rather, his message is targeting white moderate Republicans who have reservations about voting for a raging bigot. Blow said that this is  the most horrible form of bigotry. It is the kind of bigotry that says,  I will knock you down while I pretend to pick you up,'  Blow said.  It says that,  I m not talking to you, I m talking to the guy behind you or over your shoulder.  It s the kind of bigotry that says,  I m urinitaing on you and telling you to dance in the rain.' Blow said that he has spent the past week trying to find out if Trump s bullsh*t message had resonated with any people of color. Here s a shocker, it didn t. Blow said this just goes to show that Trump s  outreach  isn t reaching anybody except for right-leaning whites. It is the moderate ones who say,  I don t want to be the woman/man who votes for the racist guy, and if this guy can now change his opinion, I do want to be conservative, but I don t want to be the conservative who votes for the racist guy, and now he s different,'  Blow said. Actually, he s not different. He s not talking to us. He s pretending to talk to us while he talks to you. This is an insult to all people of color, black, Hispanic and otherwise, because he s using us as pawns, and you do not get an out,  Blow continued.  He was a bigot yesterday, he s a bigot today, and he ll be a bigot tomorrow, and if you vote for him, you re voting for a bigot. That s it.

 Trump Adviser Confirms: Trump’s Immigration Policy Is Still Racist (VIDEO),"It s been a hell of a week for the Trump campaign with Donald Trump s recent pivots on immigration. The Republican presidential nominee and his surrogates have placed themselves in a place where they can neither go forward nor retreat. The media is trying to get a clear message from the campaign on just exactly where Trump stands on his initial proposal to forcibly deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. Trump campaign senior adviser Boris Epshteyn appeared on CNN Sunday morning, where he gave probably the most honest statement regarding Trump s new position that we re going to get.The idea is lunacy. Not only would such a massive deportation wave create one of the largest human rights crises in history, it would also cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Not to mention the fact that it would also completely destroy the United States  entire economy.That being said, Trump catapulted to his current position by tapping into his base s anti-brown hatred by promising he would do just that. So it could be said that the campaign is trapped between appealing to white supremacists and well, reality itself.After dodging the question on every cable news journalist s lips by talking about Trump s Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton s immigration plan, which agree with it or not on some points, at least actually exists, Epshteyn says: Donald Trump will make sure America stays America and Hillary Clinton s plans will make sure we have illegal immigrants coming to this country at will. Just to be clear,  make sure America stays America  is code for  make sure the United States stays white. That s all the Trump campaign has left. Vague promises to implement racist policies. That s all folks.You can watch the segment below.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"August 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

This year s roast is all about Rob Lowe, and the roasters do go after him quite heartily and gleefully. However, it seems that Ann Coulter is also inexplicably a roaster this year, and the other roasters decided to burn her about as bad as they did Rob Lowe.Coulter is a Trump fangirl. She s also just about the most racist and hateful public figure in all of existence. She takes all of Trump s bizarre rhetoric 700 steps farther than it needs to go, while calling him out for not going far enough. These comedians don t really seem to like her all that much, and neither did the audience. They actually booed her for using her appearance there to promote her most recent book,  In Trump We Trust.  Oh, please.Variety did us all a favor and captured the following zingers delivered at Coulter s expense:Nikki Glaser:  The only person you will ever make happy is the Mexican who digs your grave. Peyton Manning:  I m not the only athlete up here. As you know, earlier this year, Ann Coulter won the Kentucky Derby. Davidson:  If you are here, Ann, who is scaring the crows away from our crops? Lowe:  After seeing your set tonight, we ve seen the first bombing you can t blame on a Muslim. Jeff Ross:  Ann is against gay marriage. What is your thinking on that? If I can t get a husband, they can t either? Jewel:  I do want to say as a feminist that I can t support everything that s been said tonight. But as someone who hates Ann Coulter, I m delighted. Rob Riggle:  If Ann Coulter is here, someone must have said her name three times. Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! And perhaps the harshest, from Jimmy Carr:  Ann is one of the most repugnant, hateful, hatchet-face bitches alive. It s not too late to change, Ann. You could kill yourself. Coulter herself tried to play comedian, too, and threw out this, ahem, gem, which was probably the only  gem  she uttered all night: I want to welcome everybody to the Ann Coulter roast with Rob Lowe. That s about the only thing she s ever gotten even close to right, even if she did solidify the idea that this roast is all about her. Everything she thinks is twisted, bigoted, false, and delusional. As the old clich  goes, even a stopped clock is right twice a day. Coulter, however, is right considerably less frequently than that.These are just a few of the jokes various Rob Lowe roasters shot her way, despite the fact that she was likewise a roaster, but has no connection to Lowe. Lowe explained her appearance by saying that they need all flavors at these roasts in order to make them work, and that s why she was there.Whatever the reason, though, Variety insinuates that her entire performance fell far more flat than anybody else s. Poor, poor Ann. Our hearts bleed for her and how stupid she ll look on Labor Day, which is when this will air.Featured image by Christopher Polk/Getty Images",News,"August 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Scottie Nell Hughes Calls Clinton A Bigot For Speaking Out Against Racism,"On Sunday, Scottie Nell Hughes joined a panel discussion on CNN s Reliable Sources where the Trump campaign surrogate defended Donald Trump s characterization of his Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton as a  bigot.  The justification for the label? Clinton is prejudiced against the racist faction of Trump s base.Most of the conversation surrounded the Trump campaigns hiring of Steve Bannon as his campaign CEO. Bannon is officially on a  temporary leave  from his position as the executive chairman for the reactionary (often dubbed as the  alt-right ) right-wing media site, Breitbart. The site caters to an audience that would probably consider Fox News to be a liberal propaganda network.MTV News host, Jamil Smith said during the panel discussion that he considers Breitbart to support white supremacy and racism. I would say that [Breitbart is] part of the white supremacist machine. They are trying to make sure these views become mainstream. And I think, through Trump, they are finding a way to do that. Trump has faced waves of criticism for the move to hire Bannon from Clinton, the left, and even some members of the right. To which Trump referred to Clinton as a bigot for doing so. Here s Hughes justification for the use of the term: Bigotry, if you look at the definition, it s about someone who s small-minded and sits there and directs hate towards a certain group. Hillary Clinton s speech was all about hate towards a group that, while my fellow counterpart might consider them to be very racist, it s the exact opposite. At that point, Hughes dives hot-head first into one of her just this side of unhinged rants, claiming that just because a section of Breitbart s readers are white supremacists, doesn t mean they all are.Smith, apparently noticing that Hughes doesn t understand what he said at all clarifies his position: What they present is the view of the white supremacist mentality through their coverage. It s not necessarily saying,  Well, everyone who works there is a white supremacist.  I don t know that.  Smith continues, finalizing his thoughts,  The point is to say, what kind of viewpoint did they reflect? And it s undeniable that they reflect a white supremacist view if you looked over their coverage over the last several years. I would consider being called a bigot against white supremacists and those who promote it a badge of honor, as I m sure most people would. In the mind of a Trump campaign surrogate, that s a valid line of attack.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"August 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Chuck Todd BLISTERS RNC Chair Over Trump’s Tax Return Refusal (VIDEO),"On Sunday, RNC Chair Reince Priebus sat down with Chuck Todd on Meet the Press, where the two discussed Donald Trump s refusal to release his tax returns. While they are not bound by law, presidential candidates have traditionally released their tax returns to the public. It serves as a way to gain trust with the public because tax returns have a unique way of showing what financial allegiances one has. Trump has refused to take part in the tradition.Todd questioned Priebus on the matter, asking: One final question when it comes to the issue of the Clinton Foundation and tax returns. I want to ask it this way. Donald Trump s been hitting hard on the Clinton Foundation and saying all sorts of behind the scenes, pay for play allegations. Does he have   does it undercut his message if he won t release his tax returns? Would he have some higher ground, be on higher ground here when criticizing Clinton s finances if we saw his tax returns? No I don t think so,  Priebus responds. By the way, Roger Stone is the latest Republican to call for Donald Trump to release his tax returns, a close friend of Trump s,  Todd mentions. No I don t think so, Priebus reiterates before saying,  Because if you look at what Hillary Clinton has done   I think when voters look at what Hillary Clinton actually did, they see somebody that they believe broke the law. They see somebody who gave away state secrets. They see somebody that went out of her way   We know that Hillary Clinton shouldn t be trusted with national secrets and with the most precious   the most precious information that our country has in their hands. We know she can t be trusted. Are you equating that the known conclusion that she can t be trusted with state secrets to what could be in Donald Trump s taxes? That s when Todd gets to the heart of the matter at hand. We ve had a history of every major nominee releasing their tax returns, Reince. Every major presidential nominee,  Todd says.  And by the way, he is a private businessman whose companies may or may not benefit from him being president. That s something voters should want to know. For a Republican running with a reactionary campaign slogan like  Make America Great Again,  Trump sure does not have any respect for American traditions.You can watch a clip from the interview below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"August 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Mike Pence Gets Embarrassing Grilling After He Evades Simple Question,"Donald Trump s Republican running mate Mike Pence, made an appearance on CNN s State of the Union Saturday morning where he was grilled by the show s host, Jake Tapper. The grilling was brought on by a line of questioning regarding Trump s flip-flop on his proposal to forcefully deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.The segment begins with Tapper playing a clip of Trump from last November where he clearly states that  We re going to have a deportation force,  that will seek out undocumented immigrants and deport them to their country of origin.Throughout his campaign, Trump has referred to the undocumented immigrants his force would target as criminals. It s a clever bit of political double speak that trump has used. It implies that he is only going after undocumented criminals. From Trump s supporters  viewpoints and his rhetoric, all undocumented immigrants are here illegally and are therefore criminals. Now that Trump is in general election mode, they need to come up with specifics. Trump cannot back away from his tough talk on immigration without burning his base. However, he also has to bring the scale of his proposals down since they are so radical they sound like they originated from a neo-Nazi s fever dream and thus alienate everyone whose hobbies don t include cutting eyeholes into white sheets.That s why during the interview Pence insists that Trump hasn t pivoted on the issue: Nothing has changed about Donald Trump s position on dealing with illegal immigration. His position and his principles have been absolutely consistent,  Pence said.  The choice could not be more clear for the American people. Donald Trump has been completely consistent in his positions. Tapper doesn t buy it. He responds to Pence saying: Except on this issue. The one issue you didn t really address is whether or not the 11 or 12 million undocumented immigrants will be removed by a deportation force as you heard Mr. Trump say in that clip from November of last year. Let  be clear: Trump has been slowly pivoting on immigration since the general election began. First, he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. Now, he wants to ban people who come from what he views as terrorist nations. He is doing the same thing with his proposal to create a mass deportation force. He has to. Setting aside the fact that it would create one of the largest human rights crises in the world, it would also cost the U.S. around $600 billion dollars. It would also have a side effect of completely destroying the U.S. economy.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screen capture ",News,"August 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BUSTED: Donald Trump Protected Known Cocaine Trafficker (VIDEO),"Republicans like Maine Governor Paul LePage like to scare people with stories of black drug dealers corrupting our communities, but their own presidential nominee once went to great lengths to make sure a convicted cocaine trafficker received a light prison sentence.In 1985, Joseph Weichselbaum was indicted for drug trafficking. But while the drug dealers under him were sentenced to serve 20 years in prison, Weichselbaum only had to serve 18 months because Donald Trump stepped in as a friend and apparently pulled some strings, according to Trump biographer David Cay Johnston.During an appearance on CNN on Saturday, Johnston told host Mike Smerconish all about how Trump met this cocaine trafficking creep, housed him, and protected him from getting the punishment he deserved. Donald got his personal helicopter and the one for his casinos from a convicted felon who turned out to be a major drug trafficker, and instead of cutting ties with this guy, he kept him on, he rented him an apartment under very unusual circumstances as I described in the book,  Johnston said.  He wrote a letter pleading for mercy for him, saying he was a stand-up guy. The guy got 18 months while the people who actually delivered the drugs for him got 20 years. And, by the way, the case came before at one point Judge Maryanne Trump Barry   Donald s older sister. This is the explosive story that could derail Trump s already imploding campaign. And let s not forget that Trump has said that he would consider his sister for the Supreme Court.It s so explosive, in fact, that Trump supporter Betsy McCaughey didn t even bother to refute it. Instead, she ignored it altogether and changed the subject by accusing Hillary Clinton of being a racist and claimed that Trump would make sure American workers get a higher take home pay even though Trump is supported by white supremacists and he fights constantly to make sure his workers can t unionize to fight for higher pay.Here s the video via YouTube.And it s not like Johnston isn t a credible source either. He has covered Donald Trump for 28 years and is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. But you know that Trump supporters are going to call him a Hillary Clinton pawn.Speaking of Hillary Clinton, conservatives have been attacking her for defending an accused rapist in Arkansas in 1975. But conservatives apparently need to be reminded that every person in this country has the right to a competent defense in court no matter what they did or are accused of doing. It s kinda like how Founding Father John Adams defended the British soldiers who fired upon a crowd in Boston in 1770. And while Hillary did not feel good about representing the alleged rapist, she was still obligated to do her job to the best of her ability after being assigned to the case by the judge. It s the prosecuting attorney s job to put defendants in jail and the prosecutor failed to do so. Hillary cannot be faulted for being a better lawyer.Trump, however, was not obligated to associate himself with a drug trafficker. He did that voluntarily and continued to associate with Weichselbaum even after he was convicted, going so far as to make an effort to get him a light sentence for his crimes.Apparently, Trump s brand of  law and order  is that some defendants should be handicapped in court but if you re a friend of Trump even a drug trafficker can escape justice after being duly convicted in a court of law. Just imagine how many convicts could escape justice under a President Trump who has the power to grant pardons.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"August 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mike Pence Hilariously Claims There’s No Basis For Racism Claims Against Trump (VIDEO),"Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is probably privately wishing he had never been tapped to be Donald Trump s running mate. Thanks to Trump s erratic behavior and many outrageous, offensive statements, Pence is put into the position of defending him constantly   and some things are just not defensible. Nonetheless, Pence at least has to try. Appearing on CNN s State of the Union Sunday morning, Pence was forced to respond to the accusations of racism that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leveled at Trump in a blistering takedown that used the tycoons own words and actions to make the case that he s running to be Racist-in-Chief. Hilariously, Pence dismissed the speech as desperation: I think Sen. [Tim] Kaine s [D-Va.] comments, Hillary Clinton s comments on Thursday night sound desperate to me. The fact that you see Democrats and Hillary Clinton and her running mate rolling out the same old playbook of racial divisiveness sounds a little bit to me like an act of desperation. The American people are sick and tired of politicians who seek to divide the people of this country to unite their supporters. Pence then took the whole  Make America Great Again  tack, and said he finds the accusations offensive. Well, Gov. Pence, your running mate has one hell of a long list of racism. Here s just a few examples:I think we all know that I could go on forever regarding Trump s racism. That s just a sampling, off of the top of my head. Now, Gov. Pence, please defend these actions as  not racist.  Oh, that s right. You can t. Because these ARE racist actions, and you know it. However, because you ve been brought on to the Trump campaign to essentially be a pooper scooper, you can t admit that you are, indeed, trying to get a dyed-in-the-wool, bona fide racist elected as president.

 WATCH: Hitler EXPLODES At Trump Campaign In Hilarious Video Mocking White Supremacist Rage,"As white supremacists whine about Donald Trump s flip-flop on immigration, someone kindly created a video of Adolf Hitler going batshit crazy about it.During an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, who has become the Republican nominee s chief propagandist, Trump backed away from his core promise to round up and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.Of course, all of the racists who support Trump s campaign immediately lost their small minds, with some even going so far as to threaten Trump if he doesn t keep his original promise.Ann Coulter even threw a fit about it and complained that Trump is talking about amnesty. So it looks like Coulter and the rest of Trump s hardcore supporters have lost a little trust in their candidate, which is hysterical since Coulter s new book is titled In Trump We Trust.To mock Trump s supporters, RINO Pundit used the Hitler biopic film Downfall and changed all of the subtitles to show the Nazi leader furiously throwing a temper tantrum over Trump s new immigration flap. Hannity, Coulter, Reince Priebus, Chris Christie, and Matt Drudge are all not spared from Hitler s wrath in this hilarious video.It begins with one of Hitler s advisers telling him that Trump could get through a full week without committing a gaffe since Coulter is starting her book tour.Hitler is relieved that Trump may finally be in the clear as long as he doesn t pivot on immigration too drastically. Then he is told of Trump s Hannity interview. Trump went full-blown amnesty on a Hannity special,  an adviser reluctantly informs the Fuhrer.Then the fun begins as Hitler asks everyone who predicted that Trump would flip-flop to leave the room. All but five leave. Hitler then loses his shit and just about every major Trump supporter gets mocked.Here s the video via YouTube.This is going to make every white supremacist in America throw a hissy fit. So thank you, RINO Pundit. We salute you.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Slams Republicans For Toying With American Lives By Blocking Zika Funding (VIDEO),"President Obama used this week s  Weekly Address  to discuss the Zika virus and slam the Republicans who have chosen to block the funding necessary to fight the spread of this mosquito-borne disease.The president began by talking about a call he had gotten from a pregnant woman named Ashley who said she was  extremely concerned  about Zika and  what it might mean for other pregnant women like her.  He added that, as a father, he shared this mother s worry. Conservatives in Congress on the other hand, not so much. Republicans in Congress did not share Ashley s  extreme concern,  nor that of other Americans expecting children. They said no. Instead, we were forced to use resources we need to keep fighting Ebola, cancer, and other diseases. We took that step because we have a responsibility to protect the American people  said Obama.  But that s not a sustainable solution. And Congress has been on a seven-week recess without doing anything to protect Americans from the Zika virus. Obama said that his  Administration has done what we can on our own,  but that is not nearly enough to stop the spread of this disease. He explained the steps that citizens can take to try to protect themselves from the mosquitos who carry and spread the virus: use insect repellent, wear long sleeves and pants, get rid of standing water where mosquitos breed, etc.And then, President Obama tore into the Republican lawmakers who have been dragging their feet when it comes to funding the measures that will stop the threat of this disease, which is known to cause serious birth defects when a pregnant woman is infected, including microcephaly. But every day that Republican leaders in Congress wait to do their job, every day our experts have to wait to get the resources they need   that has real-life consequences. Weaker mosquito-control efforts. Longer wait times to get accurate diagnostic results. Delayed vaccines. It puts more Americans at risk. One Republican Senator has said that  There is no such thing as a Republican position on Zika or Democrat position on Zika because these mosquitoes bite everyone.' I agree. We need more Republicans to act that way because this is more important than politics. It s about young mothers like Ashley. Today, her new baby Savannah is healthy and happy. That s priority number one. And that s why Republicans in Congress should treat Zika like the threat that it is and make this their first order of business when they come back to Washington after Labor Day. That means working in a bipartisan way to fully fund our Zika response. A fraction of the funding won t get the job done. You can t solve a fraction of a disease. Our experts know what they re doing. They just need the resources to do it.

 Tim Kaine Shows Trump DECENT Way To Respond After His Shameful Dwyane Wade Tweet (VIDEO),"Senator Tim Kaine (D   VA) , Hillary Clinton s running mate, made a heartfelt response to the recent shooting death of NBA star Dwyane Wade s cousin, Nykea Aldridge. He told reporters that leaders should  ought to be extending our sympathy to the family  as the  only reaction that s appropriate,  while also expressing sadness about  this gun violence issue. Kaine on Trump's tweet about Dwyane Wade's cousin: ""We just ought to be extending our sympathy to the family"" pic.twitter.com/HGnb02EOku  Thomas Kaplan (@thomaskaplan) August 27, 2016Kaine s statement came a few hours after Donald Trump generated a firestorm of responses when he sent out a self-congratulatory tweet about the death of  Wade s relative. Trump responded to the murder:   Dwayne Wade s cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP! Millions of people saw the tweet and hundreds responded to its crass exploitation of the death and for its ham-fisted messaging towards African-Americans.Wade issued a series of tweets after Trump s stumble, pointing out the need to curb gun violence, especially in cities like Chicago, where his cousin lived. Trump has been endorsed by the Natonal Rifle Association (NRA), who has fought tooth and nail against any and all efforts to reduce gun violence, especially background checks and limits on gun magazine sizes. The NRA has already committed several million dollars towards electing Trump president this year.RIP Nykea Aldridge  #EnoughIsEnough  DWade (@DwyaneWade) August 27, 2016The city of Chicago is hurting.

But in reality Trump has been on a tear, insulting blacks by painting a picture of their lives as hopeless, jobless, and living exclusively in the inner cities. Many blacks have spoken out against the portrait that Trump has been painting in front of almost totally white audiences in several states.Polling currently indicates that despite President Obama not being on the ballot in November, Trump could possibly attract even less black votes than Mitt Romney and John McCain.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The N-Word Flies As Racists Attack 49er’s Quarterback For Protesting Police Treatment Of Blacks,"Just remember, Donald Trump s campaign is supported by racists, and this is how they treat people of color.Police have been unjustly killing black people at an alarming rate, and that has caused a movement to rise in protest against it. Black Lives Matter is making an effort to change the way police treat African-Americans across the nation, and that is making racists explode in rage because they cheer whenever a black person is killed in this country and they want the violence to continue.So when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick chose to sit during the national anthem on Friday night versus the Green Bay Packers to protest police shootings of black people, the racists quickly attacked him by questioning his patriotism and calling him the N-word. I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,  Kaepernick told the press after the game.  To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. And he is right. Police officers who unjustly kill black people often go unpunished and are usually sent right back out into the streets to do it again. Police departments are reluctant to do anything other than to put the offending officer on paid leave. Prosecutors are reluctant to bring charges. And even if they do, grand juries usually let what most normal people call murder slide.And let s make this clear, we are talking about officers who kill black people who are unarmed and don t resist. We are talking about officers who kill black people who run for their lives. We are talking about officers who kill black people even though suspects are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Cops are NOT supposed to be executioners.But racists believe that keeping police officers from shooting and killing black people is somehow a violation of their rights, so they viciously attacked Kaepernick.Blatant disrespect doesn t work well for impacting change. Feel free to find a country that supports you better. #Colin Kaepernick  Paul Hoffman (@papac00772) August 27, 2016 Welp, I guess my Kaepernick jersey is going out with the next thrift store donations.https://t.co/31DHUM8TMg  Holly Nicholas (@ilikerox) August 27, 2016This nigger Colin Kaepernick has a $114M contract to throw a fucking ball. Yeah, blacks are so oppressed in America.  AdolfJoeBiden  (@Bidenshairplugz) August 27, 2016 Colin Kaepernick is  keepin it real  and gets the prestigious  nigger of the day  award overtaking Will Smith in hardcore nigger status.  nate (@bloodandsoil5) August 27, 2016Organizers should try the Saudi national anthem. I bet Colin @Kaepernick7 & boycotting U.S. Muslims will stand erect https://t.co/R9aiLSNuzH  (((Tarek Fatah))) (@TarekFatah) August 27, 2016 All of you faggot cucks worshiping nigger athletes like Colin Kaepernick are getting what you want. You want to be shit on. Kill yourselves.  MOBI-WAN (@28thVerse) August 27, 2016Of course, Americans have the freedom to not stand during the national anthem just like school children do not have to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. That is their right as citizens of this country. Many conservatives are claiming that Kaepernick is disrespecting our veterans and their sacrifice, but that is not the case at all. Our soldiers fight for ALL of our rights, which includes choosing not to stand during the national anthem. Just because Kaepernick is making a political statement using the platform he has been given doesn t mean he hates our troops.If anything, Kaepernick is walking in the footsteps of Muhammad Ali, whom conservatives were praising not too long ago when he passed away. The boxing legend also took a stand against rampant racism and oppression when he changed his name and refused to enter the service after being drafted for the Vietnam War. White racists howled with rage then, too.And Kaepernick was taking a stand for others, not himself. So claiming that his multimillion dollar salary means people of color like him are not oppressed is bullshit. But the fact that racists attacked him in these ways prove that racism and oppression still exist in this country and that these racists are desperate to regain the white dominated racist America of the past.And they are trying to do that by supporting Donald Trump s racist campaign for the presidency.Yet Republicans still wonder why black people won t vote for them.Featured image via Wikimedia ",News,"August 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Joy Reid Shuts Down Trump Supporter’s Bizarre Eugenics Conspiracy Theory (VIDEO),"Joy Reid once again proved that she isn t putting up any nonsense on her show. During a segment of AM Joy, Reid eviscerated a Donald Trump supporter who implied that Planned Parenthood is part of a eugenics program meant to racially cleanse people of color. Alfonso Aguilar, the executive director Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles went on the program to discuss Trump and his spreading of white supremacist propaganda via his Twitter account when he decided to bring up this conspiracy theory about Planned Parenthood. He does control his own Twitter account,  Reid said.  He is retweeting white nationalists. Which, if you re following them, and they re somehow in the stream of your social media. Aguilar responded to Reid, saying: I think I could argue that is a double standard. Margaret Sanger. Let s talk about Planned Parenthood That is not a double standard. You re mentioning a dead person gone for many decades, Reid shot back. Planned Parenthood is not a eugenicist organization. And I think that is incredibly offensive. Planned Parenthood is a health organization. Good gracious. Aguilar persists with the line of questioning, saying: 52% of all abortions are performed on Latino and African-American That s as far as Aguilar gets before Reid shuts him down entirely. Good gracious. Okay, I think that smear on Planned Parenthood cannot go forward, we are not going to continue with that line of questioning,  Reid finished.It s nice to see that there are still people on cable news willing to not give their guests the time of day with their outrageous theories.You can watch a clip of the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"August 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Colbert Tears Mylan CEO Apart With This Brilliant Comparison,"Stephen Colbert delivered a scathing segment directed at Mylan executive Heather Bresch on Friday night, for raising the price of Epipens. During the segment, Colbert compared Bresch to Martin Shkreli, A.K.A  Pharma Bro,  the CEO responsible for raising the price of HIV medication by 5,000 percent.Early on in the segment, Colbert hilariously pretends to use one of the lifesaving Epipens, saying: That was a clone one. I am allergic to douche. The devices  price jumped from $100 dollars a pair to $600 dollars a pair without any good reason for the cost increase other than increasing Mylan s profits.She s  frustrated,  Colbert said.  I mean the tone-deafness of that just takes your breath away   and getting your breath back will cost you over 600 bucks. Mylan has responded to widespread condemnation of the price hike, by essentially pretending to lower the cost of the medical device. However, it s actually a public relations move that doesn t actually do much to lower the cost at all.While CEOs such as Bresch and Shkreli  have taken heat for artificially increasing the cost of medications, they are just following the overall trend in the pharmaceutical industry. A recent study found that the cost of prescription drugs have been skyrocketing for the past five years.Pharmaceutical companies can charge whatever they like for their medications. Other countries, such as Canada which has a national healthcare system, regulates such things. Which is why Canadians have not been subjected to the same price gouging for Epipens as people in the United States have been.Bresch and Shkreli  are certainly douchebags who are worthy of Colbert and the public s mockery. However, they are just cogs in a machine that will continue to hum along until people demand real change in the United States healthcare system.You can watch the segment below, in full.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Campaign CEO Didn’t Want His Kids In School With A Bunch Of ‘Whiny’ Jews,"The court records from the divorce of Trump s new campaign CEO have proved to be a treasure trove of information about the man hired to save the Republican nominee s trainwreck of a campaign. The latest insight revealed in these documents is that Stephen Bannon has deeply anti-Semitic tendencies. Shocking, I know. (Insert eye roll here.)According to court documents, the former Breitbart bigwig was worried about sending his twin daughters to the Archer School for Girls because of the number of Jewish students who were enrolled. A statement signed by his ex-wife in 2007 said that Bannon was concerned about the impact Jewish classmates would have on his children. The biggest problem he had with Archer is the number of Jews that attend,  read her statement. He said that he doesn t like the way they raise their kids to be  whiny brats  and that he didn t want the girls going to school with Jews. When they looked into at least one other private school they were considering sending their daughters to, his ex-wife said that Bannon asked about the number of Jewish students attending.Naturally, Bannon is denying these claims. Spokeswoman Alexandra Preate said that Bannon never made any of these statements and added that his girls did end up attending Archer. Mr. Bannon said he never said anything like that and proudly sent the girls to Archer for their middle school and high school education,  Preate said.This is the second damning revelation to come from his divorce proceedings this week. Accusations of domestic abuse came to light on Thursday. According to court documents, his wife claimed that he was a sadistic wife-beater who had grabbed her  by the throat and arm  during a domestic dispute on New Year s Day in 1996. Police came and photographed her injuries, but Bannon was able to avoid consequences by scaring his victim into leaving town so she would miss the court date.Remember folks, Trump only hires the best people.Featured image via Kirk Irwin/Getty Images for SiriusXM",News,"August 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox Guests ATTACK Each Other After Someone Calls Hillary A ‘Bigot’ (VIDEO),"Fox News host Eric Bolling had recently been filling in for his colleague Bill O Reilly on The O Reilly Factor, and he was in no way prepared for the chaos that erupted when one of his guests called Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a  bigot. The discussion began by bringing up Donald Trump s recent comments about Clinton s polices being  bigoted  and it immediately set off Bolling s guests, who spent the majority of the segment at each other s throats despite Bolling s attempts to restore a calm discussion.Civil rights attorney Leo Terrell had hit the nail right on the head when he commented that Trump had no business calling someone else s policies  bigoted.  He said: Eric, Donald Trump doesn t know the definition of the word  bigot . You don t hear Republicans on Capitol Hill supporting Donald Trump s definition of the term  bigoted  as it applies to Hillary Clinton. It doesn t make sense, it s inexplicable. Terrell also defended Clinton, stating that when she d called out Trump s racism in a speech, her argument had been  fact-based    and that s when conservative Horace Cooper lost it and countered that Clinton s speech had been a  litany of lies. What happened next was insanity. Cooper, an African American legal commentator, said that the black community would be much better off under racist Trump. He said, It s good  that someone is finally telling the truth! Somebody needed to stand up and explain that the policies that the left and progressives have been pushing are bigoted because they don t assume there is any possibility for improvement for blacks. Terrell couldn t believe his ears and told Cooper,  You should be ashamed of yourself.  Then he asked Cooper again to answer Bolling s question,  Is Hillary Clinton a bigot? Cooper said,  absolutely,  and the two men exchanged heated words as Bolling tried to intervene. Shortly after the men got into a shouting match over Trump s popularity with the racist  alt-right  and support from the KKK, Terrell repeatedly told Cooper that he should be  ashamed  for his pro-Trump views.You can watch this chaotic discussion below: Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Twitter Destroys Trump For Using Dwyane Wade’s Personal Tragedy To Pander For Black Votes,"Donald Trump s pathetic effort to reach out to black voters got even more disgusting on Saturday, and social media took him to the woodshed for it.On Friday, 32-year-old Nykea Aldridge was killed in Chicago after two gunmen opened fire on another man. She was an innocent bystander who was simply picking up her kids from school.She s also the cousin of Chicago Bulls star Dwyane Wade, who has spoken out repeatedly against gun violence.Wade announced his cousin s death via Twitter, expressing his grief and once again condemning the gun violence that has plagued the city.My cousin was killed today in Chicago.

We re still going to try and help these people to transform their minds and give them a different direction, so this thing won t keep happening.

Wade and his family have not even had time to mourn their loss and Trump is already politicizing it for personal gain.This is about as sick as politics gets, and to add insult to injury, Trump couldn t even be bothered to spell Wade s first name correctly.And as usual, Twitter was quick to jump all over Trump for his insensitivity and lack of human compassion.

 Trump: Dwayne Wade’s Cousin Was Murdered So African Americans Will Vote For Me (TWEETS),"Donald Trump went to new lows in his efforts to win over voters of color on Saturday morning. On Friday, NBA star Dwayne Wade s cousin Nykea Aldridge was fatally shot while pushing her baby in a stroller outside of an elementary school in Chicago.Trump took to Twitter Saturday to say that the tragic incident clearly shows that his views on urban violence are correct and that means voters of color will vote for him November. Dwayne Wade s cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP! Dwayne Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2016Trump has been desperately trying to win over black voters, with no success. Tweets like the one above and other campaign blunders might have something to do with it. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, Trump began August with 5.6 percent support from black voters. That already incredibly low figure plummeted to 2.5 percent earlier this week on Monday. So, it appears that Trump may have actually been doing much better with black voters before he actively started to try to win them over.Trump s primary message to voters of color can be summarized as,  Take a chance on me.  So far, Trump has not delivered any concrete reasons on why minority voters should do so, given his completely tone deaf rhetoric and nearly, or blatantly racist and xenophobic policy proposals.Dwayne Wade took to Twitter to confirm the death of his cousin. His Tweet also carried a political tone, one that is antithetical to Trump s campaign. In the tweet, Wade used the hashtag #EnoughIsEnough, a slogan that came out of the Bernie Sanders campaign, to rally against  another senseless act of gun violence.   After his nephew was shot twice in the leg in 2012, he created the Wade s World Foundation. The foundation helps community organizations that help at-risk youth.My cousin was killed today in Chicago.

 Economists Warn Trump Would CRASH The Global Economy,"The possibility of Donald Trump being elected President of the United States represents a clear and present danger to the global economy, according to a new report from economists a Citigroup.The election of Trump could easily trigger a meltdown, they say. A Trump victory in particular could prolong and perhaps exacerbate policy uncertainty and deliver a shock (though perhaps short-lived) to financial markets,  a team led by chief economist Willem Buiter wrote in the Thursday note.  Tightening financial conditions and further rises in uncertainty could trigger a significant slowdown in U.S., but also global growth. According to Citi, a conservative estimate of what would happen to the economy should Trump become president implies that global GDP growth could fall  easily  below its benchmark of 2% for a global recession.By comparison, the economists said Hillary Clinton winning would likely keep the American and world economies growing at the steady rate they are growing at. A recent report from the credit reporting agency Moody s also saw the Trump campaign as a threat towards the world economy.Objective analysis of stock market returns has shown that they perform better under Democratic presidents than with Republican ones. Of the last five presidents, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has done better with Clinton and Obama than Reagan and the two Bushes. The only president to have the market at a lower number than when he first came in is George W. Bush.Many of Trump s economic team are former members of Bush s inner circle but Trump has failed to offer much in the way of substance about his economic plans if elected. He, instead, has more often than not simply shot off his mouth to whatever television journalists he was speaking to at the moment.Trump has indicated an unusual willingness to go after America s international allies, most notable NATO, while espousing support for the regime of Russia s Vladimir Putin.Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Federal Judge Tells Anti-Vaxxers To Go F*ck Themselves, Upholds Strict California Vaccination Law","Anti-vaccination advocates were hoping they could continue exposing the general public to diseases that had been largely wiped out by vaccines, but a judge dashed that hope on Friday.In 2015, California dealt with a months long measles epidemic stemming from a person who was visiting Disneyland.According to the Los Angeles Times:131 California residents were believed to have been infected with measles during the outbreak that began at Disneyland, as well as at least 26 people who resided in seven other states, Canada or Mexico, after visiting the Anaheim theme park or catching the virus from someone who went there.The outbreak created a health crisis in the state, especially since some schools have immunization rates around 50 percent or lower according to state epidemiologist, Dr. Gil Chavez.Measles had been eradicated in America by 2000, but because some crackpot researcher in England published a terribly flawed study claiming that vaccines cause autism, a claim that has been thoroughly debunked by scientists, many paranoid and ignorant parents have decided not to vaccinate their kids, which is why 7 in 10 Californians who got the measles were unvaccinated. If we had higher levels of immunity in the community, this outbreak would not have happened,  Chavez said.And the risk of exposure was not just in California schools. Public health officials contacted thousands of Californians in 12 counties potentially exposed to measles, leading to warnings in airports, malls, schools, clinics and hospitals,  the Times reported.  In one hospital alone, a single person with measles exposed 14 pregnant women and 98 infants, including 44 in the neonatal intensive care unit. After California quelled the epidemic, state lawmakers went to work to make sure such an epidemic never happens again. To that effort, they took particular aim at personal and religious exemptions that anti-vaxxers have taken advantage of over the years to decline to vaccinate their kids. They soon passed a law requiring all children to be vaccinated. The only exemption allowed is if the child has a medical condition, such as a suppressed immune system, that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.But anti-vaxxers threw a hissy fit and filed a lawsuit last month in order to prevent lawmakers from protecting the public health and safety.And U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that they can go f*ck themselves and laughed them out of court because state lawmakers have a  long history of requiring children to be vaccinated as a condition to school enrollment  and  plaintiffs have not made a showing that they are entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction. In short, the law will go into effect this year and now every child will be required to be vaccinated if they want to be enrolled.And that s a good thing.We cannot let irresponsible parents put the public health at risk just because they disagree with science. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to man and is even more contagious and deadlier than Ebola.Sixteen years ago this country had wiped out the disease within our shores, and all that effort went to waste because some parents listen more to celebrities like Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy than they do to doctors and scientists. That needs to change, and this California law is the first step.Featured image via CBS News",News,"August 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Dad Of Murdered Reporter Hits Trump, GOP BEAUTIFULLY Over ‘Assault On 2nd Amendment Nonsense’","The father of a Virginia reporter who was shot to death last year, along with her cameraman, has some extremely strong words for Republicans over their refusal to do anything about gun violence. He reserved his most scathing words for Trump, though, who actively promotes the idea that the 2nd Amendment is under heavy assault and we re just a breath away from losing all our guns.Andy Parker, whose daughter, Alison Parker, was murdered by a disgruntled employee on television, made it his mission to end gun violence after her death. He rails at Republicans who are in the pockets of the all-too powerful NRA in an op-ed for the New York Daily News, which was a full-scale attack on them, and especially on Trump: Politicians like Paul Ryan, Mike McCaul and Bob Goodlatte know better. They re not knuckle-draggers waving Confederate flags at Trump rallies, but they still fall in lockstep behind their orange-faced Fuhrer who promotes this  assault on the Second Amendment  nonsense. Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out.  [emphasis mine] Orange-faced Fuhrer.  That s a good description. That s a fantastic description of Trump and his relationship to the GOP! Trump is not just promoting the very things that have led to increased gun violence here, he s far more likely than anybody else to become the dictator America (especially Republicans) have always feared.Parker went on to say that he d confronted Bob Goodlatte after a speech about slain police officers, in which Goodlatte never once mentioned guns, and asked him how he sleeps at night. Apparently, Goodlatte had no answer for that. Parker said,  As usual, he looked like he d swallowed a lemon. Trump and the NRA s minions in the GOP grossly insult all the victims of gun violence by fear-mongering about Democrats trying to abolish the 2nd Amendment. It s like a game to them; who can come up with the most guilt-trippy argument against sensible gun legislation? Here s what former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh did:Liberals shout  women s equality , yet they seek to strip women of their 2nd Amendment rights. #WomensEqualityDay pic.twitter.com/7vOCNocqPO  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) August 26, 2016How disgusting to use rape victims and women s equality as a rallying cry for their guns, guns, guns everywhere nonsense. But that s what the GOP and their standard-bearer, the Orange-Faced Fuhrer, do nonstop. They use victims of violence to expand the very thing that harmed them in the first place.Parker vows to continue the fight and move the needle on the national conversation about gun violence, and that means fighting against the GOP and the NRA. He had this to say in his op-ed, too: Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out.

 Trump’s Doctor Makes Bizarre Confession (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s doctor didn t follow standard medical procedure when he proclaimed the Republican nominee to be in good health, according to a newly released video. Dr. Harold Bornstein, who has reportedly been Trump s physician for 35 years, confessed that he took only five minutes to write up the assessment of Trump, who he described in the letter as in  excellent  health.The four-paragraph letter   the only medical information released by Trump   was written and released in December but has drawn fresh scrutiny in recent days as Trump s allies have questioned Hillary Clinton s health, despite a more detailed two-page letter from her doctor that said she has no serious issues.In his letter, Bornstein said there were no  significant medical problems  in Trump s history and that a recent examination  showed only positive results. If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,  Bornstein wrote.The letter and Trump s doctor have received renewed scrutiny after the desperate Trump campaign began trafficking in rumor and innuendo about Hillary Clinton s health. Campaign surrogate and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani raised eyebrows when he urged voters to Google search  Clinton illness  to pull up conspiracy theories about the former Secretary of State, and Trump himself has been making remarks about Clinton s  stamina. Despite the Trump campaigns allegations, Clinton s health has been assessed to be good by a real physician citing an actual examination, compared to Trump s doctor.Trump s doctor claims to be board-certified in internal medicine and gastroenterology, but also made comments in his letter attesting to Trump s mental health   how would he have any insight into that?The episode, as with issues of race and religion so far in the election, have shown once again that so many of Trump s attempts to attack Clinton backfire on him due to his odd behavior and the oddity of those he has surrounded himself by.Featured image via YouTube",News,"August 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Maine’s Horrible Governor Just Outright Declared Blacks And Hispanics ‘The Enemy’,"Paul LePage, who might as well be Maine s version of Donald Trump, is becoming well known for his racist attacks on people of color. He especially can t stand black people or Latinos, and went so far as to call them  the enemy.  In other words, he sees a race war in which white people are the  good  side, and black and Hispanic people are the  evil  side. Look, a bad guy is a bad guy, I don t care what color it is. When you go to war, if you know the enemy, the enemy dresses in red and you dress in blue, you shoot at red, don t you? You shoot at the enemy. You try to identify the enemy. And the enemy right now, the overwhelming majority right now coming in are people of color or people of Hispanic origin. I can t help that. I just can t help it. Those are the facts. There s no implication there. He said, flat out, that the enemy right now is the black and Hispanic people coming into his state. Those are  the facts  on his twisted planet. The true facts are that he s a racist prick. We can t help that.LePage has claimed that 90 percent of the people arrested for drugs in his state are black or Hispanic   data based on a binder of mug shots he allegedly keeps. Maine is 95 percent white, but LePage justifies his racism by saying that people of color are all criminals.The actual state prison statistics for Maine paint a fairly grim picture. Per 100,000 residents, Maine has 140 white people incarcerated, 104 Hispanics incarcerated, and an astonishing 839 black people incarcerated.That s a prison population that s roughly 77 percent black, and 10 percent Hispanic, so LePage s  90 percent  comment is actually not far off.However, in a state that s 95 percent white, that s really sick.And LePage trots out these statistics specifically to perpetuate hate against people of color, when in reality the disparity is largely due to racism in the justice system.The ACLU of Maine has a problem with this, obviously, because it means that Maine police are nine times more likely to arrest a person of color than they are to arrest a white person, even though whites and people of color deal drugs at about the same rate. Despite that pesky little fact, LePage is implying that Maine is in an all-out war against people of color for no other reason than he s a racist dick.Featured image by Maine Dept. of Education.

 Trump Comes Unglued Once Again In Ongoing Feud With ‘Crazy’ ‘Morning Joe’ Hosts (TWEETS),"Despite the fact that MSNBC s Morning Joe s main host, Joe Scarborough, is an avowed Republican, the show s hosts and guests from across the political spectrum can t stand Donald Trump. They pull no punches and give his surrogates no breaks. Of course, the tough questions and constant criticism of his fitness for the office he seeks makes The Donald come apart at the seams.On Friday, Trump once again showed just how thin-skinned he is, when he tweeted out a demand for an apology, along with an insult directed at Scarborough s co-host, Mika Brzezskinski, in which he called her  crazy  all for daring to challenge one of his surrogates regarding the racist comments that Trump made about Trump University lawsuit Judge Gonzalo Curiel. Here is the tweet:Wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @MSNBC by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @Morning_Joe. Apologize!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2016The conversation to which Trump took such high offense involved a black pastor and ardent Trump supporter Mark Burns. Brzezinski asked Burns:When [Trump] made the comments he made about the judge, saying he was a Mexican, was that racist or not? Of course Trump surrogates, regardless of race, will absolutely not acknowledge that his comments have been racist or that he has been playing footsie with the likes of white supremacists, anti-semites, Ku Klux Klan members and the like. So, of course Burns went on the offensive, saying: If I was in Mr. Trump s shoes, I don t think that it was racist. I understand what real racism is. I m from the South, I m a black man from the Deep South, OK? In South Carolina just two months ago, they re-raised the Confederate flag in my state to celebrate its one year s removal. So for you to sit here and ask me like I don t know what real racism is, I don t think so. Now, as a black woman I don t generally take kindly to white people telling black people how to feel about race, race politics, and racism, but let me tell you, I definitely make an exception when it comes to Uncle Toms. That is what black Trump supporters are. The man has a lengthy and well documented history of racist statements, racist business practices, and associations just from this campaign alone that prove, unequivocally, that even if there is no racism in his head or heart, there s definitely an overt tolerance for racists and racism within the Trump campaign and by Trump himself.Even after Burns was done, Brzezinski continued to hammer Trump, saying, You have no idea   you have no idea what your words mean.  And to top it all off, Scarborough took a shot at Trump for his addiction to Twitter, and to watching his own press coverage:Is Donald Trump crazy? You betcha.Crazy for Morning Joe. The Trump U founder just can't quit us! https://t.co/YG7C7tQNUN  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) August 26, 2016Indeed, it is Trump who is the crazy one here, not Mika. He should be worried about his slipping polls numbers and campaigning rather than feuding with television pundits. Once again, he shows how temperamentally unfit he is to lead this great nation.

 Anti-Gay Pastor Who Cheered Killing Of Pulse Victims Just Got Arrested For Child Molestation,"This hypocrite just got his ass handed to him by karma.Ken Adkins is an anti-gay  Christian  pastor in Georgia who cheered when a gunman killed nearly 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando,Florida this past June.The nation was horrified by the mass shooting, but many so called conservative  Christians  were very pleased.Adkins himself wrote on Twitter that the victims deserved to be killed. I don t see none of them as victims,  he wrote.  I see them as getting what they deserve!! His tweet received wide condemnation but that didn t bother the 56-year-old  man of God.  He simply continued preaching hate to his congregations.But now karma is biting Adkins in the ass for doing something that conservative  Christians  often falsely accuse gay people of doing.On Friday, Adkins turned himself in to police after he was accused of molesting a child in 2010.Adkins alleged molested the victim on multiple occasions in several different locations, including the church, in his car, and at the victim s home.The charges against Adkin s are especially ironic considering what the pastor has said about LGBT anti-discrimination laws.According to the Florida Times-Union,Adkins is a controversial figure in Jacksonville politics, particularly because of comments and crude caricatures he posted on his Twitter account while he helped lead the fight against expanding Jacksonville s anti-discrimination law to cover lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.Among the criticisms that Adkins lodged was his assertion that expanding the law would make it easier for sexual predators to find victims in bathrooms.Yet, it sounds like we need stricter laws protecting children from pastors instead.Adkins isn t the only pastor to meet karmic retribution after remarks about the Pulse nightclub shooting.Pastor Steven Anderson actually called for executing gays across the country in a video in which he cheered the slaughter at Pulse.The good news is that there s 50 less pedophiles in this world, because, you know, these homosexuals are a bunch of disgusting perverts and pedophiles,  Anderson spewed. These people all should have been killed, anyway, but they should have been killed through the proper channels, as in they should have been executed by a righteous government that would have tried them, convicted them, and saw them executed. You gotta wonder when Anderson will also be arrested for child molestation someday. After all, he sure does enjoy talking about pedophilia and accusing people of committing it even though he has no proof to back up his claims.At any rate, at least we got to see him throw a fit about various companies terminating their business ties with his church. You know, because businesses generally don t want to have anything to do with bigots who support mass murder.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"August 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WV Republican AG Spokeswoman BUSTED Appearing In Racist KKK Propaganda (VIDEO),"You know what s adorable? When a white supremacist  Christian  attempts to  Jesus  his or her way out of trouble after getting caught being him or herself. In this case, we re talking about West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey s now-former spokeswoman s participation in an extremely popular white supremacist propaganda video. THE  Stop White Genocide  Video  features a bunch of women reciting lines from  The Mantra,  a sort of ode to whiteness written by popular South Carolina racist Bob Whitaker. The video, which boasts that is has previously been removed from YouTube and that it is banned in 18 countries, features Carrie Bowe reciting many lines that will surely embarrass everyone she holds dear. One line spoken by Bowe lays the groundwork for a string of hate speech even your racist, drunk uncle wouldn t break out at Thanksgiving dinner:I ve been thinking a lot about a phrase I ve been hearing: that anti-racist is a code-word for anti-white.The women, including Bowe, complain about the  obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide  against the white race. In fact, the former spokeswoman even has the final speaking line:  Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white. Bowe, who started working for WV s Republican attorney general in January 2015, was fired within hours of the Charleston Gazette-Mail exposing her role in the racist video. The employee s conduct and statements, which occurred years before being employed by the attorney general s office, were not previously disclosed until today, which is contrary to the transparency requirements for being a member of this office, do not reflect the opinion or the perspective of the attorney general or this office,  Morrisey spokesman Curtis Johnson wrote in a statement regarding the termination.Bowe inexplicably claims that she didn t know what the finished product would look like despite the horrific phrases she personally spouts off in the white supremacist garbage video. In a post on Facebook, she attempts to garner sympathy from her friends by not even mentioning what she did:Bowe told West Virginia Public Broadcasting that she is embarrassed and heartbroken  because she thought the video was meant to further discussion on race relation from a white perspective  an  assertion easily disproved by the very choice phrases she spoke. Growing up, you could not question why some races could talk or behave a certain way and it was seen as OK, whereby if the behavior was repeated by a white person, it was automatically racist,  Bowe explained.  As a child and a teenager, the inability to even question this was confusing and, really, the opposite of the honest dialogue we need to have in order to understand different cultures and their history better. She has not explained how the  final solution to the black problem  she references ties into an open, healthy discussion on race relations.One must wonder: was she fired because she spouted off KKK rhetoric, or was it because Morissey wants to be re-elected?

 Maine’s Largest Newspaper Apologizes To America For The Embarrassment Named Governor Paul LePage,"This could easily be about Donald Trump should he get elected in November, except that the whole nation would be sorry instead of just a single state.Maine already has been dealing with their own version of the Republican nominee for years now and he somehow got elected and re-elected as the Governor and the results have been nothing short of embarrassing and disastrous.So the editorial board of the Portland Press Herald, Maine s largest newspaper, apologized to the entire country on Friday expressing regret that Paul Lepage was elevated to the office he currently occupies. Dear America: Maine here. Please forgive us   we made a terrible mistake. We managed to elect and re-elect a governor who is unfit for high office. He has a gruff exterior and blunt way of talking that some of us find refreshing, but he has shown again and again that he governs by grudge, and uses his power to beat up on people who cannot fight back. The people LePage beats up on the most are African-Americans and Hispanics, whom the Tea Party governor has repeatedly blamed for crimes and drugs in the state, even going so far as to accuse them of trying to take advantage of white women in the state after they are done delivering heroin.The hate and fear mongering has caused many people to think twice before relocating to the state, whose population is getting older. This has hurt industries that are desperate for new blood to remain in operation.But LePage doesn t give a damn about that. If he could hang a  whites only  sign on the  Welcome To Maine  billboard at the state line he would do it. LePage knows that his words are widely understood to mean that he thinks that the color of their skin makes some people more likely to commit crimes, the Press Herald continues.  Rather than clarify or withdraw those statements, he repeats them.And that s exactly what Donald Trump does. Just like LePage, Trump makes toxic remarks that have drawn white supremacists to his campaign while repulsing minority voters across the country.Only now is he pretending that he wants their votes after his poll numbers have imploded.Take out LePage s name and replace it with Donald Trump s throughout the editorial and it s a perfect match.Like LePage, Trump often blames the media for his own blunders and makes offensive remarks that make him look like a jackass who should never have been on the ballot in the first place. LePage also doesn t apologize and has a thin skin.After Democratic state Rep. Drew Gattine commented about LePage s racism, the Republican governor lashed out by leaving a nasty and threatening message on his voicemail I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you cocksucker,  LePage said.  I want to talk to you. I want you to prove that I m a racist. I ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. You   I need you to, just friggin    I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you. It would be nice to think that LePage would reflect on what he says and learn from these incidents, but he appears to be completely incapable of change,  the Press Herald lamented about the incident.  He will probably blame the media again for any embarrassment he suffers, but everyone has heard the tape and knows what the governor said. Unfortunately, LePage will be in office until 2019, which gives him plenty of time to do more damage and humiliate the state of Maine ever more. Somehow, that s the only  bright side  the Press Herald can think of.On the bright side, America, LePage isn t going to be governor forever, and when his successor takes office in 2019, Mainers of all political parties will have to work together to fix the damage he has done to our reputation. We hope that this person will be a leader who will welcome people of all races to live in Maine, and invest in our wonderful state.Until then, please accept our apology. We ll try not to do it again.America needs to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president. The last thing this country needs is a Paul LePage on the national level. It would be embarrassing and we would have to apologize to the entire world for all of the destruction Trump causes over the next four years assuming that he doesn t somehow get re-elected like LePage did in Maine.So let s make sure we don t have to make such an apology by making sure Hillary Clinton wins in November.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"August 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Campaign CEO Caught Committing Voter Fraud,"Republicans are great at creating controversy where there is none. They shut down the get out the vote organization, ACORN, because they fraudulently made people believe that ACORN was a criminal front (because, you know, black people). They ve also tried to strangle the life out of Planned Parenthood, again, for fraudulent reasons.One persistent non-problem that Republicans are manufacturing is voter fraud, which is virtually non-existent. This is actually pretty big deal. According to a poll released this week, more than half of respondents felt that voter fraud was real, and most of those were Republicans.Trump himself has been beating the drum about voter fraud when he proactively claims that the only way he d lose is if the election is rigged. Well, maybe Trump should look right under his nose. It appears that there is voter fraud, but it s coming from Trump s own newly hired campaign CEO, Steve Bannon. Bannon is registered in the swing state of Florida, but records show that no one actually lives at the address to which he s registered. In fact, it s set to be torn down. That makes him a criminal, at least according to Florida law.According to a report in The Guardian, Bannon has never lived in the house he claims as his residence. His ex-wife, Diane Clohesy once lived there. She moved out earlier in the year. The two divorced seven years ago.If you think that s just some sort of inadvertent paperwork error, well, it happened twice.Bannon previously rented another house for Clohesy in Miami from 2013 to 2015 and assigned his voter registration to the property during that period. But a source with direct knowledge of the rental agreement for this house said Bannon did not live there either, and that Bannon and Clohesy were not in a relationship.Bannon, Clohesy and Trump s campaign repeatedly declined to answer detailed questions about Bannon s voting arrangements. Jason Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, eventually said in an email:  Mr Bannon moved to another location in Florida.  Miller declined to answer further questions.According to neighbors, Bannon has been to the first house (which he paid $5,500 a month for), but only a few times and he certainly didn t live there. The neighbors at the second house say they ve never seen Bannon.Bannon does set up shop in what he calls  Breitbart embassy,  which is a $2.4 million townhouse right next to the Supreme Court building. Bannon lives upstairs while his staff works in the basement. That, however, is owned by Mostafa El-Gindy, who s an Egyptian businessman.This may be less about voter fraud than tax fraud. Florida has no income tax, so people often try to set up Florida addresses to escape taxes. Attorneys typically recommend that they also attach a voter registration address as some sort of evidence of residency. There is no record Bannon has voted from that address.If Bannon is found guilty of submitting false information on a Florida registration form, it s a third-degree felony and punishable by up to five years in prison. Of course, the odds of him actually being prosecuted are pretty damned slim, but it does put a big wrench in the Trump campaign s claims of voter fraud.Featured image via CNN video screen capture.

 America’s Stepdad Tim Kaine Just Burned Trump HARD On Colbert,"Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine spent his Thursday evening with Late Show host Stephen Colbert, and of course eventually the conversation turned to the absolutely destructive force that is the Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump. The first element of Trump s many outrageous statements to be discussed was his absurd description of Trump calling Kaine s running mate Hillary Clinton a bigot. Kaine reminded the audience the difference between the two candidates  records regarding America s race troubles: When Hillary Clinton got out of law school, she was working to help advance racial justice in the juvenile justice system in South Carolina and fight school segregation in Alabama, and I about that time got out of law school and was battling housing discrimination in the South and in Virginia. At his early career, Donald Trump was a real estate guy who got sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against people in housing (by) writing the letter C on applications if they were minority,  Kaine continued.  Hillary Clinton has got a track record all the way back to being a middle schooler in a Methodist youth group of trying to advance priorities for others   and Donald Trump s for himself. Kaine is right, of course. The contrast couldn t be more stark, and history speaks for itself. If anyone is the bigot in this scenario, it s Donald Trump, not Hillary Clinton.Briefly, Stephen Colbert turned to his and Kaine s shared faith, and asked Kaine to recite a New Testament verse he is fond of. Kaine responded with Philippians 2:3: Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind consider one another as more important than yourself. Colbert then cited  his own favorite verse in Latin. A backstage interview yielded more criticism of Trump from Kaine, when he said: This is fundamentally about the nation s promise of equality. If we are supposed to do a U-turn or not, so you got to take that seriously, and I m really glad she just reminded everybody that is what is at stake in November. Kaine says that if he ever gets to confront Trump, he d ask one simple question: How can you say the things you re saying? Kaine then continued  his final blistering blow: He is going around saying that the American military is a disaster, ridicules a Gold Star family, makes fun of John McCain because he was a POW   that kind of personality shouldn t be within 10 time zones of being commander-in-chief. So right, Senator Kaine, so right. Hopefully, people listen to you.Watch a clip below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Hey Conservatives, You Might Want To STFU About ‘Klansman’ Robert Byrd And Clinton","This might shock you, but in their clumsy and pathetic efforts to smear Hillary Clinton as a Ku Klux Klan supporter because she considered Democratic Senator Robert Byrd a  friend and mentor,  conservatives leave out a lot of relevant information.Clinton s opponent in the 2016 presidential race, Donald J. Trump, is pretty much the  KKKandidate.  Not only do white supremacists hang on his every word as he promises to build a wall to keep brown people he calls  rapists  and  murderers  out of the country and to force Muslims to wear special little badges to identify them (not to mention the national Muslim registry and concentration camps), but he has been endorsed by numerous KKK members, both past and present. This, of course, includes David Duke, who is no longer a member of the Klan but is involved with white supremacist group, the NAAWP: the National Association for the Advancement of White People.Hillary Clinton s recent campaign ad points out these associations, showing clips of actual Klansmen praising Donald Trump   and Trump and pals are just desperate to find something   anything   with which they can distract from the very real, verifiable fact that Trump is the official Klandidate.The very flimsy thread upon which they depend to make this case is Robert C. Byrd. Unlike Duke, who is an unabashed white supremacist, Byrd s time with the Klan was short-lived. Ultimately, as a thinking and learning human being he dropped out of the Klan in 1952, saying: After about a year, I became disinterested [in the KKK], quit paying my dues, and dropped my membership in the organization. Byrd spent much of his 57 years in Congress repeatedly apologizing for his involvement with the Klan: I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times   and I don t mind apologizing over and over again. I can t erase what happened. In other words, Byrd learned from his mistakes. In fact, after he passed away, the NAACP issued a statement in 2010 honoring him:The NAACP is saddened by the passing of United States Senator Robert Byrd. Byrd, the longest serving member of congress was first elected to the U.S. House from [West Virginia] in 1952 and was elected Senator in 1958. Byrd passed away this morning at the age of 92. Senator Byrd reflects the transformative power of this nation,  stated NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous.  Senator Byrd went from being an active member of the KKK to a being a stalwart supporter of the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and many other pieces of seminal legislation that advanced the civil rights and liberties of our country. Senator Byrd came to consistently support the NAACP civil rights agenda, doing well on the NAACP Annual Civil Rights Report Card. He stood with us on many issues of crucial importance to our members from the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, the historic health care legislation of 2010 and his support for the Hate Crimes Prevention legislation,  stated Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Advocacy and Policy.  Senator Byrd was a master of the Senate Rules, and helped strategize passage of legislation that helped millions of Americans. He will be sorely missed. You don t exactly see the NAACP praising Duke or Trump, do you?Nevertheless, Republicans have been accusing the media of  ignoring  this association between Clinton and Byrd, circulating a photo of this man the NAACP points to as an example of the  transformative power  of the United States, the ability for people with rather abhorrent prejudices to change their viewpoints, kissing Clinton on the cheek:And, of course, there s her praise of Byrd after his passing:Robert Byrd was not a perfect man, but he was always eager to learn from and make up for his mistakes. He spent most of his career tirelessly working to atone for the hate that once consumed him. To those who are not complete idiots, the story of Robert Byrd is one of healing, one of redemption, and certainly not a can of worms Republicans would want to open if they, like Byrd, were thinking individuals capable of change.Unfortunately, they are not. It s not the 1940s anymore. How many times must they be reminded of this?Featured image via Facebook",News,"August 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SEARING WaPo Op-Ed CRUSHES Rudy Giuliani’s Claims That Hillary Is Sick,"The rumors that Hillary Clinton is sick have been flying around the right as conservatives desperately search for any way possible to take her down and elevate the disaster that is Donald Trump. Even Katrina Pierson tried to claim that Hillary has a  rare brain disease  with no evidence whatsoever. These not-so lovely people point to videos of her coughing and appearing to have a seizure, criticize her for getting helped up some stairs, and even claim that her glasses are evidence that she s gravely ill.Rudy Giuliani, who s increasingly extreme and will do anything to remain endeared to Donald Trump, earned a lot of flak for claiming that Hillary Clinton is sick, too, without a any evidence other than online videos. The Washington Post decided to hit Giuliani back on that with an op-ed titled,  Is Rudy Giuliani Okay? The first three paragraphs of the op-ed are both scathing and sarcastic, and perfect for what Giuliani has done: During his 15-minute speech at the GOP convention last month in Cleveland, it was notable that when he said Donald Trump loves  all people, from the top to the bottom,  Mr. Giuliani animatedly gestured toward his knees as he said  top,  and above his head as he said  bottom.  Also, why did he say that he and his wife, Judith, have been friends with Mr. Trump for 30 years, though he met his wife in 1999, only 17 years ago?Also   we re noting this purely out of concern   during his speech he often licked his lips, indicating dry mouth, which, according to the Mayo Clinic, can be a symptom of nerve damage, stroke or Alzheimer s disease. At the end of his address, beads of sweat were visible on his pate   did that not suggest heart disease?Mr. Giuliani is just 72, but he seemed slightly stooped as he walked to the lectern, where his wide stance made us wonder if he s unsteady on his feet. Then there was his slurred diction, as when he referred to  jushtified  police shootings and Syrian  refyoongees.  More evidence of a stroke? Come to think of it, Giuliani did look a bit decrepit at the convention, didn t he?See how he can t seem to stand up straight? (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) And what is up with that squint? Did he have a a stroke that affected his vision? (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)We can make ludicrous claims like Giuliani, too.The Post wanted to give Giuliani and the rest of the right wing a taste of what it s like for people who aren t doctors of any sort, let alone their doctors, tell the world that they re obviously ill. The truth, however, is that we actually have less cause to question Hillary s health than The Donald s, because Hillary has had a real medical exam and released it.Trump, however, has not. The record he released was a complete sham (like literally everything else he s done), his doctor is a quack at best, and, like his taxes, he won t release his actual health records. So how are we to know how healthy he really is, despite his quack s assertions that he d be the healthiest president ever?Of course, the Post acknowledges that their assessment of Giuliani s health is ridiculous, as they should and as we did above. Their goal was to put the entire  Ermagherd Herllery ers serck  crowd on the right in their place, and they did an outstanding job of it.So how does it feel to have someone who is not your doctor, or a doctor of any kind, diagnosing you with health problems based solely on how you appeared on television, Mr. Giuliani?Featured image by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",News,"August 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 UH-OH: Sarah Palin Sounds Ready To Declare WAR On Trump,"Sarah Palin has stepped out of the shadows and sent a warning shot across Donald Trump s bow. Largely silent for most of the election since she endorsed Trump some months ago, Palin is speaking out after Trump made comments that have been interpreted as a change in his anti-immigration position.While there s no actual concrete policy shift, and just comments made on cable news, Trump has said he could back away from his proposed plan for a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.That has angered Palin, who went on the record with the Wall Street Journal.In recent days, Mr. Trump has shifted away from calling for mass deportation of illegal immigrants to suggesting some could stay if they paid back taxes. If Mr. Trump were to go down a path of wishy-washy positions taken on things that the core foundation of his support has so appreciated, and that is respecting our Constitution and respecting law and order in America, then yeah, there would be massive disappointment,  Mrs. Palin, the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008, said in a telephone interview with the Wall Street Journal.  Parts of that message we heard in the last week are clearly not consistent with the stringent position and message that supporters have received all along. Support from Palin undoubtedly helped Trump during the primaries, especially when she had previously been associated with more traditional conservatives like Senator Ted Cruz.But since then she has been on the backburner. He has done few campaign events with her, and she did not receive a speaking slot at the Republican Convention in Cleveland. When asked about the apparent snub, Trump made the bizarre claim,  It s a little bit difficult because of where she is. We love Sarah. Little bit difficult because of, you know, it s a long ways away.  Palin has previously spoken at conservative events like CPAC on the east coast without any transportation problems.Featured image via YouTube",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Alabama GOP Mayor Calls Opponent ‘N*****’ After Losing Election (SCREENSHOTS),"You know how we often jest, largely because it s true, that conservatives are racist? Well, maybe we ve misjudged them. The Republican mayor of Midland City, Alabama had a classy response when someone asked her how the election went. Breaking what seems to be an unending series of Trump supporters and other racists/Republicans saying horrible things about black people, Patsy Capshaw Skipper congratulated her opponent, Jo Ann Bennett Grimsley, on a hard-fought race and wished her well. Just kidding   she called her a n*gger, because Skipper is a Republican and what do you really expect from them these days?Skipper, with 148 votes, was soundly defeated by Grimsley s 233, with a third candidate managing 59.  I hope she does a great job for the city and I am very happy for her,  the current Mayor said publicly when asked how she feels about Grimsley being her new Mayor. But outside the spotlight, seemingly protected by her Facebook privacy settings, she had a slightly different opinion.A man named Don Thompson, apparently posting on his wife s account, asked how the election is going, leading Skipper to go from zero to racist in less than a second:The only response this received was  I m so sorry. It s appalling,  Arlissa Minniefield, who serves as town clerk and magistrate for the Town of Newton, said Thursday. It was she who shared the post.  As a former employee there, to know that you worked under people that had those kinds of feelings is very disheartening.  She has previously served as magistrate for Midland City.But never fear   Skipper claimed that her Facebook has been  messed up for several weeks  and adds  I think I ve been hacked. Facebook, of course, offers robust (and, at time, irritating) security features that force a person to enter a code that is sent to a user s cell phone if they attempt to log in from an unfamiliar device. Before this feature was implemented, the  hacked  excuse was viable, but not today, Skippy, not today.She says that she had just undergone heart surgery and had not even been out to campaign for re-election. Interestingly, she was able to remove the post from her  hacked  account   unless, of course, our mystery hacker felt bad about what he or she did and un-did the damage. You know, since hackers are typically known as being magnanimous.This is one epic f*ckup that can not be blamed on voters. When her husband, Virgil, retired in February due to health reasons, Midland City council voted 3-1 to appoint Skipper to fill his shoes. It is unclear if she also fills his Klan robe and hood, or if she picked those up herself.Featured image via screengrab",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Supporting KKK Leader Defends Trump And Alt-Right In Response To Hillary’s Brilliant Speech,"David Duke is a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard who also happens to be one of the most famous white supremacists in modern history. He is also, like many white supremacists, anti-semites, and other assorted despicable bigots, a Donald Trump supporter. Today, as we all know by now, Hillary Clinton issued a blistering takedown of Trump in a brilliant speech delivered in Reno, Nevada. She indicted the so-called  alt-right  movement   which is really nothing more than the new white supremacy   as well as Donald Trump himself for being nothing more than bigots, and bringing their bigotry into the mainstream via this presidential election. Well, of course, David Duke was most unhappy with this, and decided to issue a statement defending the alt-right   which of course means, at this point, that he is also defending Trump.Duke talked to Buzzfeed s Andrew Kaczynski and said:Kaczynski went on to tweet:Bottom line, the white nationalists trust Trump and don't find his condemnations of them to be sincere.  andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) August 26, 2016He s right, of course. They know that Trump is just doing what he has to do to get elected. He is their guy. They know that all of his pathetic and disingenuous attempts to reach out to communities of color is really just lip service; hell, he isn t even actually talking to communities of color. He s trying to assure more mainstream white people that he isn t quite as racist as they thought, and that they should still vote for him, because he s still their man.Trump s campaign has completely embraced the lunatic fringe, and they are welcoming him with open arms. No matter how much his campaign staff tries to  soften  his bombastic tone and gets him to read off of a teleprompter, the truth is already out there, via not just Trump s own words, associations, and actions, but also via the full throated endorsement and defense of Klan leaders and other white supremacist leaders like David Duke.GOP, if you ve any sense at all, you ll kick ALL of these racists out of your party. You can t just say you aren t racists. You have to prove it. Take the hit this election, and reject Trumpism before it is too late.Featured image via SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Has A Much Bigger Problem With Speaking Fees Than Clinton Ever Did,"For months now, the right and some on the left have been politicizing the fact that Hillary Clinton, like virtually all people who have been in positions of power, gets paid to speak for large audiences. Clinton earns large paychecks for the speaking engagements   around $200k a piece, much of which has been donated to the Clinton Foundation. So why doesn t anyone talk about the fact that Donald Trump made far more in speaking fees for a company that is essentially a pyramid scheme?Well, to be fair, the right-wing Daily Caller is talking about it.Trump s presidential financial disclosure, which was released on Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, shows that he has been paid $450,000 each for three speeches given on behalf of ACN Inc., a North Carolina-based  multi-level marketing  company. The celebrity and real estate billionaire spoke most recently at ACN s annual convention which was held in Charlotte in February.Trump first became involved with ACN in 2006. In 2009 and 2011, company executives appeared on the mogul s NBC reality show,  Celebrity Apprentice.  During one of those episodes, a video phone ACN was selling was a featured product.Like all multilevel marketing companies, ACN (American Communications Network) is more about recruiting people   people who have to pay $499 just for the privilege of selling products plus an annual fee and training expenses. That s all kind of standard, but Robert Fitzpatrick, who runs the website called Pyramid Scheme Alert, says ACN is one of the worst. They don t seem to care about sales at all, but they do care about offering false hope and Trump is part of that.I ll let this video tell you more:Here s another:There are negative reviews all over the internet about ACN. While they have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, that s only after the Bureau had to field 203 complaints over the last three years.It s doubtful Trump cares. Trump sells his name to anything that might give him a profit. Trump University should be enough to show that Trump is a scam artist and a fraudster. The fact that Trump chose to get in bed with a Multilevel Marketing Company with dubious, at best, ethics, says all we need to know about the man who could be president.Featured image via Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images.",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Clinton’s Devastating New Ad Puts Trump’s White Supremacist Ties On Full Display (VIDEO),"On the same day as Hillary Clinton denounced Donald Trump for his racist alt-right connections in a blistering speech, she released a devastating new ad that put his white supremacist ties on full display for the world to see.The ad opened with a clip of a Grand Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan declaring that he and other white supremacists support Trump because  a lot of what he believes in, we believe in.  It also featured robocalls that had been made by white supremacists on behalf of the Republican nominee during the primaries. Another clip in the ad has former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke announcing that  voting against Trump is treason to your heritage.  The ad also shows when Trump failed to disavow Duke and white supremacy in general.Clinton s campaign ad also calls out Trump s most recent campaign manager, Stephen Bannon, who is the CEO of alt-right Breitbart news. The alt-right is described in the ad as  the dressed-up-in-suits version of the neo-nazi and white supremacist movements. The racist white supremacist support Trump s campaign receives cannot be ignored, and Hillary Clinton is making sure that his bigotry doesn t slip through the cracks now that he has launched  minority outreach  efforts in the hopes of luring voters of color to the GOP. Trump has dog-whistled to white supremacists from the very beginning and has only gotten bolder as time has gone on. As a result, the racist extremists of the alt-right have flocked to his cause. As Clinton points out in this ad, if Trump wins in November,  they could be running the country.

 ‘Simpsons’ Creator Matt Groening Eerily Foresaw Today’s Republican Insanity 25 Years Ago,"Matt Groening loves to poke fun at everything conservative and Republican. From the hilarious Fox News motto on a news chopper that circles Springfield, home of The Simpsons, to his own comic, Life In Hell, he s been clear that Republicanism is not something to which he takes kindly. This is plainly in evidence in Life In Hell, where he rewrote the Pledge of Allegiance several times.The most amazing of these pledges captures right-wing bigotry, fundie Christian culture, and jingoism very well. It reads:Matt Groenig predicted the future in 1994 pic.twitter.com/VJ0joILC18  Butch Brodie (@butch_brodie) August 25, 2016 I pledge allegiance to and wrap myself in the flag of the United States against anything un-American, and to the Republicans for which it stands, two nations, under Jesus, rich against poor, with curtailed liberty and justice for all (except blacks, homosexuals, women ). Look at today s GOP. It has been hijacked by flag-waving, gun-toting pseudo-Christians who think  Murica is the greatest nation on earth, and woe to he who disagrees with any of that. In doing so, they ve co-opted our flag and turned it into a symbol of all that is wrong, not right, with this country.Groening may not have known it at the time, but he was predicting the future of the Republican Party with this particular pledge. However, it s not the only time he s made fun of the Pledge of Allegiance. He had this one, too, from 1991: I pledge impertinence to the flag-waving of the unindicted co-conspirators of America, and to the Republicans for which I can t stand, one abomination, underhanded fraud, indefensible, with liberty and justice, forget it. And this one: I plead alignment to the flakes of the untitled snakes of a merry cow and to the republicrats for which they scam: one nacho, underpants with licorice and jugs of wine for owls. Maybe Groening saw back then what we re actually living now? These nutbags are people who think they re  taking their country back,  and in the process, have pretty much stolen everything that made us the United States of America (except fundie Christianity and the oppression that comes with it, and ammosexuality. They can keep those two). These three pledges are beautiful examples of everything wrong with Republicans.Featured image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren Announces That A Major For Profit School Is Banned From Accepting Students,"If there s one thing Elizabeth Warren hates, it s when ordinary citizens get the wool pulled over their eyes and are taken advantage of by greedy corporations.In an effort to make at least one company no longer have the ability to cheat students out of a proper education and tens of thousands of dollars, ITT Tech will no longer be allowed to accept students.Warren took to Facebook to make the announcement: ITT Tech   a massive, for-profit college   is currently under investigation by 20 state and federal agencies for cheating students.

ITT Tech failed, again, to meet the scandalously low standards of its accrediting agency, but still sucked down a whopping $600 million in taxpayer dollars last year.Today, the Department of Education has finally declared that enough is enough, banning ITT Tech from enrolling any new students with federal student loan and grant dollars this fall. ITT s free ride is finally over, and the message couldn t be clearer: We will no longer stand by and allow these shady institutions to bilk taxpayers and cheat students. https://www.facebook.com/senatorelizabethwarren/posts/636549976507499Warren also posts a link that explains what is happening and what current students can do or expect. Part of the article explains:As a current ITT student with federal loans, you have some options:You can continue your courses at ITT with your federal student aid. There s no immediate change to your program.You can transfer your credits to a new school (if that school accepts them) and complete your education.You can pause your education and wait to see how this matter resolves itself in the coming months. If ITT closes before you finish your program and you don t transfer your credits, you will likely be eligible to discharge your federal loans.This is huge news, and long overdue. All too often these for-profit schools continue to take money while providing subpar education, often not properly accredited. These schools spend more on advertising than education and take advantage of people who may not necessarily realize they are being robbed.It is wonderful to finally see some justice be made and watch at least another one of these scam schools be given what is long overdue.Featured Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 These 2 Orlando Hospitals Just Saved Pulse Nightclub Shooting Victims Over $5 Million In Costs,"The two Orlando-area hospitals that treated the shooting victims from the tragic Pulse nightclub attack are doing something amazing: They won t bill those patients for their out-of-pocket costs. Considering the fact that ER visits and hospital stays can run tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars, and our healthcare industry prioritizes getting their due dollars in any way possible over care, this is amazing news indeed.Instead, Orlando Regional Medical Center, which treated most of the victims, will seek additional payment from insurance and from a victims  fund that city officials established in the wake of the shooting. Whatever insurance and the victims  fund don t cover will be written off.Florida Hospital, which treated 12 victims, said it actually won t bill any of them or their insurance, nor will it bill them for follow-up treatment stemming from the attack.The two hospitals together will write off at least $5.5 million in treatment and care.David Strong, president and CEO of Orlando Health, said: The pulse [sic] shooting was a horrendous tragedy for the victims, their families and our entire community. During this very trying time, many organizations, individuals and charities have reached out to Orlando Health to show their support. This is simply our way of paying that kindness forward. The families of those who died won t find themselves charged, either.The victims who received care are relieved   they were set to get fucked sideways with a rusty chainsaw by the abysmal payer structure that exists in our healthcare industry, which actually bankrupts entire families. Indeed, most of them (if not all of them) can t afford to pay for this level of hospital care.These are people who simply went out for a night of fun, and ended up badly hurt and in the hospital. They have to deal with the far more insidious mental and emotional trauma of the shooting in addition to healing from their physical injuries, and victims  families are in a lot of pain, too. Nobody should ever have to deal with the added stress of hugantic bills for medical care they need.Now these victims can relax a bit about their treatment, and focus more of their energy on healing in all ways. If only more in our greedy, for-profit healthcare system cared as much as these hospitals.Featured image by Gerardo Mora/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Bizarre Reaction To Hillary’s Speech Calling Him Racist Proves He’s Racist (TWEETS),"Donald Trump, besides being a classic narcissist, also exhibits classic projection behavior. Nearly everything that s been coming out of his mouth lately regarding Hillary Clinton is exactly what has been said about him. It s as if he doesn t think anyone will notice, and likely his imbecilic supporters won t.Now, in a move that is bizarre to most sane-minded individuals, Trump is trying to paint Hillary Clinton as a racist. You know, the woman with 90+% of the African-American vote locked up.Why does Hillary have such widespread support from the black community? Because she s worked her whole career to make life better for them. It s not rocket science.Well, it s that and the fact that Donald Trump, quite literally, is racist and is supported by white nationalists everywhere.Trump has been pandering to the black and Latino vote at almost every recent rally. It s obvious, pathetic, and kind of insulting to people s intelligence. Something he doesn t have to worry about among his pack of lemmings.So, when Hillary delivered a speech in Reno, Nevada highlighting how very racist Trump is with his incendiary remarks, and there s evidence to back it up with how he s treated the Latino community, and how he refused to rent property to African-Americans back in the 70s, his quick reaction was to say Hillary is actually the racist one.How did he deliver this reaction? Via his favorite medium of choice   Twitter, of course.Directly after a tweet pandering to the African-American community that read,  So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise  which assumes all black people live in poverty, Trump tweets out his reaction to Hillary slamming him.Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2016Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2016Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2016Take some time to really absorb that. He s literally saying what everyone is saying about him. He s proving to the world that he knows he s a racist, but thinks if he can say  I know you are, but what am I  no one will notice.The American people aren t that stupid, Donald, and we will make sure you get nowhere near the Oval Office come November at the voting booth.Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rachel Maddow Asked Trump’s Campaign Manager About His Muslim Ban–The Result Was Priceless (VIDEO),"By now most of us know that anytime a member of the Trump campaign gets confronted about one of their leader s disgusting policies, it does not go well for them. Wednesday night s segment of The Rachel Maddow Show was no different   host Rachel Maddow grilled Trump s new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway for a solid 40 minutes.Maddow made sure to take full advantage of the fact that she had a Trump operative right in front of her, and she didn t waste a second. For six intense minutes of the interview, Maddow confronted Conway about the Republican nominee s  total and complete  Muslim ban, which he d suggested in December. Bringing up the fact that Trump had partially backtracked and flip-flopped on the idea, Maddow asked Conway if Trump still intends to enforce that policy. Conway s response was just like all of Trump s   indirect and avoidant.Conway said that Trump had  clarified  his proposal recently, but that it had also stayed the same. While many interviewers might have accepted that answer and moved on, Maddow let Conway know that this wasn t going to be that kind of interview. Maddow wouldn t let it go, and pressed her: There s a reason why we keep not moving on from this stuff. December 7, when he made this statement, it was like every political firework went off at once. Because nobody could believe he was saying, if you are from a specific religion, you re not allowed to come here. If that s no longer the case, that s a big deal. Maddow also fired off several of Trump s previous offenses such as his racist, inappropriate attacks on the Khan family and the Curiel family, stating that out of both of the responses Conway was trying to give her,  only one of them can be true : In the same way that his statement of regret, if it s meant to apply to the Khan family, the Curiel family, we can t give him credit to that, unless he tells us that he s communicated that to them. This is stuff of his own making. If you want the campaign to not be about this stuff anymore, he s the one who has to end those controversies. You re in a position of trying to defend what he said last week, and not refer to what he said in December, but only one of them can be true. Conway responded by not answering the question and accusing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton of flip-flopping over 20 times. Conway also threw in an attack about the Clinton Foundation, accusing the former secretary of state of corruption. Maddow once again put Conway back on task,  But your own campaign is about your own candidate, right?Conway said: No. There s a choice.   yes, this campaign is about two candidates. If I can say one thing about the coverage, it s not that it s biased or slanted. It s incomplete. It s a referendum of Donald Trump, like you re going to the ballot box and it s going to be a big picture of Donald Trump with a light. You either put a black x over him, or you say yay. Maddow reminded Conway that  one candidate is planning on banning people from the United States.  When Conway accused Clinton of  hiding,   Maddow dropped this truth bomb: Not doing press conferences is one thing. But proposing a ban on people coming to the United States over a specific religion Conway said that Maddow could bring her cameras to interview The Donald himself, but it s doubtful that Trump would rise to the challenge   especially after watching Maddow destroy Conway in this interview.You can watch this segment below:Featured image is a screenshot",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Furious Trump Supporter Threatens To Kill Trump After He Changes Immigration Policy (VIDEO),"Republican nominee Donald Trump recently surprised everyone when he flip-flopped on the harsh immigration policy he d been promising his racist, hateful supporters since the beginning of his campaign. It turns out, not everyone is taking this news very well   especially the Trump lovers who wanted nothing more than to see millions of illegal immigrants heartlessly removed from the country they built their lives in.On Wednesday s segment of The Glenn Beck Program, a furious Trump supporter shared his reaction to Trump s recent softening on immigration   and it wasn t good. In speaking to host Glenn Beck,  Nate from Virginia  actually delivered a threat to Trump. The guest warned: As long as he does the basic things, the foundational things, which is build a wall, he s not going to have people like me coming after him. Beck wasn t alarmed at first, but was visibly stunned as angry Nate continued his rant. Seemingly speaking for all Trump supporters, Nate said: Oh, he s in so much trouble. You don t even understand the backlash of us, the ones who are so frustrated and angry and tired of all the political stuff. We re going to come after him, personally, you know what I mean? We re going to get him. Beck clarified,  I don t know what you mean. Hang on, what does that mean? Nate s response was far from comforting: You know, the most peaceful way you can get rid of a president When Beck hopefully suggested that Nate might have meant he wants to impeach Trump, Nate corrected him and said he definitely meant violence: Well, I mean, hey, you yourself said he s condoned violence in the past, hasn t he? He s appealing to people who are very frustrated and angry. Their frustration and anger can only be subsided if he makes his promises true. And he has a lot on his shoulders, maybe he himself doesn t even know how much. But if he doesn t come through for us, he s going to have bigger problems, bigger problems than what you know. Beck was so disturbed by  one of the spookiest phone calls I ve ever received  that he hung up on Nate.You can watch the call unfold below:A few weeks ago, Donald Trump had suggested that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton should be assassinated by the  Second Amendment people.  He might just be getting a taste of his own medicine now   by the very hate movement he created.Featured image via Jonathan Bachman / Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump ‘Promises’ To Fix Black People’s Problems And Gets Spectactularly Owned For It On Twitter,"Donald Trump must really think black people are stupid.The Republican nominee has been making a series of pathetic attempts to reach out to black voters on the campaign trail recently as his poll numbers continue to implode. What the hell do you have to lose,  Trump asked black voters in front of a white audience earlier this week as he claimed they all live in neighborhoods that are  war zones,  have bad schools, are unemployed, and live in poverty.Well, Trump took to Twitter on Thursday and made yet another pathetic effort to fool black voters into thinking that he actually gives a damn about them.Once again, Trump claimed poverty and crime are up in African-American communities while claiming that employment is down.  I will fix it, promise,  he tacked on at the end.So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2016Of course, Trump is talking out of his ass.As it turns out the black poverty rate over the last two decades favors Hillary Clinton and is really damning for Republicans.According to BlackDemographics.com: During the decade of the 1990s while the nation was experiencing an economic boom the poverty rate of Black families dropped from 29% in 1990 to 19% in 2000 virtually cutting the disparity in half. The economic downturn in the decade from 2000 to 2010 caused the increase of the Black family poverty rate to 24%. Since 2010 the Black family poverty rate began to decrease sightly reaching 23% in 2014, however the disparity has remained relatively unchanged since 2000.As we all know, Bill Clinton was president in the 1990s and he presided over a strong economy that benefited just about everyone, including African-Americans. But then George W. Bush took over and black families began to slip back below the poverty line, especially during the Great Recession.In addition, Trump over-exaggerates the crime in black communities and his claim that the unemployment rate among blacks is up is bullshit, too. In fact, it s been cut nearly in half since 2011.So Twitter ripped Trump a new one. .@realDonaldTrump just like you  fixed  the availability of all those apartment buildings so black tenants couldn t rent from you??

 Hillary Has BIG Lead Over Trump In Latest National Poll,"It appears Clinton s  post convention bump  has not ended quite yet. In a new national poll released from Quinnipiac, Hillary Clinton is trouncing Donald Trump by 10 points, which has been consistent with her post-convention spike in the polls.Not only is Clinton beating Trump by 10 points in this stage of the game, she has nabbed 51 percent of the vote, a milestone not reached in polling until now. With now a majority of the country supporting Clinton, Trump will have to work hard to overcome his self-inflicted controversies and multiple  shakeups  that have hardline conservatives anxious.The poll shows Clinton winning with the support of the Obama coalition:The Democratic nominee drew wide levels of support from women (60 percent to 36 percent), those between the ages of 18-34 (64 percent to 29 percent), and 35-49 (53 percent to 39 percent). Trump, meanwhile, holds a smaller advantage among men (48 percent to 42 percent) and a large lead over Clinton among whites who do not have a college degree (58 percent to 35 percent).Independent voters prefer Clinton slightly, 46 percent to 41 percent, while likely voters between the ages of 50-64 are split, with 46 percent behind Clinton and 47 percent backing Trump. Voters 65 and older supported Trump 49 percent to 45 percent.Clinton also holds a lead of 62 points among non-white voters, 77 percent to Trumps 15 percent. Looks like his African American outreach and immigration flip-flopping is going swimmingly.The poll, which was conducted on Aug. 18-24, surveying 1,498 likely voters, and with a margin of error of 2.5 percent, shows that nine of ten voters surveyed said they have made up their mind about who they were going to vote for.Even when factoring in third party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, Clinton still beats Trump by 5 points.The time for Trump to appeal to undecided, independent voters is quickly coming to a close, as early voting begins mid September.Clinton s RealClearPolitics average has her up by 5 points, and Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight gives her an 84 percent chance of winning the election, so the poll conducted by Quinnipiac is not an outlier.Featured image via Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Doctor Hilariously Tears Apart Donald Trump’s Ridiculous Health Letter,"Donald Trump is taking a lot of fire over the letter his alleged physician wrote about his health, but it got hilariously worse on Thursday.Dr. Jennifer Gunter appeared on CNN with Chris Cuomo to discuss the letter, which was written in December by Dr. Harold Bornstein in lieu of an actual medical report.In her own examination of the letter, Gunter questioned Bornstein s terminology and picked apart how he diagnosed the Republican nominee throughout. Being able to unequivocally state that somebody would be the  healthiest individual  is just not a factual statement, right?  Gunter said.  You would have had to examine every other president to be able to say that, so that s incorrect. And then Gunter hilariously hammered how Bornstein described Trump s lab test results. Lab results aren t reported as being  astonishingly excellent  or not   we give lab values of positive or negative. Then there s the fact that he says all of Mr. Trump s results are positive   which, of course, would be a bad thing. When I tell someone they have gonorrhea, when they have a positive test for gonorrhea, they re not happy about that. That s not  astonishingly excellent. Nope, I m guessing they would not be, doc,  Cuomo replied.  Interesting example you give there. So has Donald Trump ever had gonorrhea? It s definitely a question worth asking since Trump brags about how many women he has slept with. In 1997, Trump told radio host Howard Stern that sleeping around was his  personal Vietnam  and that he was  lucky  that he didn t contract any sexually transmitted diseases.Of course, Trump would never admit it if he did contract an STD, so who is to say he didn t lie when he talked to Stern?After all, all of his test results were apparently  positive  according to his physician. We don t know why Donald Trump lost 15 pounds   he says he likes to eat KFC a lot, so that s a concern,  Gunter continued.  That s really important, you can t put a piece of medical information out there and not follow it up. Gunter then called for Bornstein to explain the inaccuracies stated in the letter. There s a lot of inaccuracies, and I think that the doctor should explain why he wrote it that way. If that s his letter and that s how he writes, what s the big deal about saying,  This is me, and gosh, I made a mistake in saying which section that doesn t exist at Lenox Hospital that I thought I was in.  So I think there s a lot of a inconsistencies, and you have a document that s this important   it should be accurate. I want my health information to be accurate, I want the information I write about someone else to be accurate, and I guess we all wonder, if this part s inaccurate, what else is inaccurate, too? Here s the video via Twitter.Doctor lays out problems with Donald Trump s health letter:  There s a lot of inaccuracies  https://t.co/hex4QIjQDG https://t.co/690IMjNBom  New Day (@NewDay) August 25, 2016As Donald Trump and his minions continue to spread false claims about Hillary Clinton s health, it s only fair to start asking questions about his own. And that means Trump s doctor note is fair game.The fact is, however, that Hillary has released her own detailed medical report written by her doctor while Trump continues to hide his own medical history from the voting public. He hoped that a bullshit letter would be enough, but going after Hillary s health only brought up new questions about his own. Voters deserve to see Trump s real medical history. If he is as healthy as he brags he is then he should have nothing to fear. But just like his taxes, Trump clearly doesn t want his medical history revealed because it could damage him even more than he has done to himself already.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ann Coulter Turns On Trump Over His Immigration Flip Flop,"Just as her new book praising Donald Trump, In Trump We Must, hits the shelves, Ann Coulter appears to now be souring on the Republican nominee she calls our  only hope. After Trump appeared to flip flop on one of his biggest campaign promises   deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants   Coulter, who has made immigration her number one issue, sent out a frenzy of tweets mocking Trump for his perceived weakness on the issue:Only part he left out was the  hoops  they ll have to jump through! Trump: No citizenship. Let me go a step further they ll pay back-taxes  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 25, 2016 Trump:  they have to pay taxes, there s no amnesty  [Pro Tip:  Back taxes  means we pay illegals $30k apiece in EITC.}  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 25, 2016It s not  amnesty.  It s  comprehensive immigration reform !!!! Trump:  they have to pay taxes, there s no amnesty.  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 25, 2016 Well, if it s  hard,  then nevermind. Trump:   to take a person who s been here for 15 or 20 years  .It s a very, very hard thing.  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 25, 2016It s  hard  to deport someone who s been here FOUR YEARS! https://t.co/Ajbon3TcDP  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 25, 2016Coulter also told reporters that if Trump continues to back down on his immigration promises made during the primaries, she would cease her upcoming book tour for In Trump We Must. On MSNBC s Hardball Coulter told Chris Matthews that his softening tone was a  mistake  and said it  sounds like it s coming from advisors. Trump is in big trouble. Ann Coulter is basically severing ties with the xenophobic billionaire, and if Ann Coulter can t support you, then there goes a chunk of right-wing support.The impending Coulter-Trump war is a glorious gift from the political gods and it could not have come at a better time.

 Here’s What Black Voters Think Of Donald Trump’s Pathetic Attempt To Woo Them,"Donald Trump is arrogant and narcissistic enough that he probably thinks he convinced black voters to support him. He is very wrong.As it turns out, black voters are overwhelmingly unimpressed by Trump s pathetic outreach effort. And Republicans have no one to blame but themselves.For years, Republicans have stereotyped black people as poor people who live in violent neighborhoods and want free stuff. Donald Trump has made that view the centerpiece of his plea to African-Americans. You re living in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed   what the hell do you have to lose?  Trump asked during a speech earlier this week.And his message has only strengthened the resolve of black voters to NOT vote for him.The New York Times actually went out and talked to black voters, unlike Trump, who was speaking to an all white audience while telling black people what their lives are like. I hear him not talking to black people, but talking to white people about black people so they will think he cares about black people,  said former Atlanta Daily World publisher Alexis Scott.  The real thing that he s trying to do is to try to protect some of the white vote by suggesting to them that he cares. He is giving voice to every stereotype he s ever heard,  Scott continued.  I heard someone say,  It s like he only watches  The Wire,  and that s what he knows about black people. National Urban League president Marc Morial wasn t a fan of Trump s depiction of black people either. It s an inaccurate portrayal of the community that seeks to define the community by only its biggest challenges,  Morial told the Times.  Black America has deep problems   deep economic problems   but black America also has a large community of striving, successful, hard-working people: college educated, in the work force. Retired postal worker Demeitrus Williams concurs. Who s he talking about?  he wondered before answering his own question.  I don t know   most of the black people I know are educated and live in nice neighborhoods. Everybody in my family is required to have a degree. Indeed, characterizing all black people as living in poverty is a huge mistake that is not based in facts. While the percentage of blacks living in poverty is still high compared to white people, only 26 percent of African-Americans live that reality.And the criticism goes beyond the people the New York Times spoke to.Charlotte Observer columnist Eric Frazier slammed Trump and the Republican Party for trying to sucker black voters into voting for them even though they don t support any of the issues African-Americans care about. Blacks vote Democrat today because Democrats fought for their votes,  Frazier wrote. The party that once welcomed cross-burning Klansmen did an about-face on civil rights and earned the black vote.Are you fighting to get those votes back? Nope.The path to do so is clear, if you re interested. Embrace affirmative action   and let racist base voters walk. Pass criminal justice reform. Champion black entrepreneurship and the rebuilding of the inner cities. Reach out to churchgoing black families; their traditionalist social values mirror yours. In contrast, Republicans have only moved farther to the right into the open arms of white supremacists and are working constantly to weaken or destroy the Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Act.So what do black voters have to lose by voting for Trump? Their rights and their freedom, which is why Republicans can expect to continue losing the black vote for years to come.Featured image via Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Chicago Police Dept. Points Out TWO Huge Flaws In Trump’s Chicago Violence Lies,"Trump s wild lies continue unabated as he continues to say that he s met with people that have never once spoken to him. This time, he s claiming he talked to the Chicago Police Department about the city s violence, and a  top officer  told him that he could solve the problem in just a week. The problem, according to Trump, is that they don t have the authority to do so.Trump appeared on Bill O Reilly s show, where he was asked about how to solve Chicago s violent crime problem. Trump spun a whopper of a lie answering that: How? By being very much tougher than they are right now. They re right now not tough. I could tell you this very long and quite boring story. But when I was in Chicago, I got to meet a couple of very top police. I said,  How do you stop this? How do you stop this? If you were put in charge   to a specific person   do you think you could stop it?  He said,  Mr. Trump, I d be able to stop it in one week.  And I believed him 100 percent. Har de har har   Trump will say anything to convince people that he knows what he s talking about. There is no way to solve any city s violence problems in a single week. Of course, to avoid looking like the fool he is, he said that he didn t ask for this mysterious officer s strategy when O Reilly asked for it.That vagueness is one of the ways that Trump maintains credibility despite all his lies.CPD refuted his claim that he s spoken to them, and one of their spokespeople said: We ve discredited this claim months ago. No one in the senior command at CPD has ever met with Donald Trump or a member of his campaign  Beyond that, the best way to address crime is through a commitment to community policing and a commitment to stronger laws to keep illegal guns and repeat violent offenders off the street. Once all of this became common knowledge, Trump s campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, tried to turn it around on the media by saying that Trump had never said he met with top brass. She claims that s what the media said, which is in keeping with the campaign s assertions that the media intentionally twists his words.CPD has disputed claims from Trump before. Back in March, when he canceled a rally due to violence and said that CPD told him to do so, they said that nobody had ever met with him, let alone told him to cancel his rally for safety reasons.Trump doesn t even know when he s lying because he does it so much. This is another example of that.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Christian Fundie Has ASININE Idea For Making Bank Off Trying To Scare LGBT Community,"Christian fundamentalists all over the country are answering some kind of a  call to arms  to defend their faith from certain death. To that end, Jared Vallorani, CEO of Liberty Alliance, sent out a plaintive email to his  patriotic  followers, which contained an idea for scaring gay people straight. It s really quite simple: We want to see 1 MILLION cars on our streets and highways with this emblem. We are not hiding. We are right in front of you and we will not lay down and allow any more of this foolishness to destroy our country that our fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers fought and died for. I want every Christian Patriot in America to get the Star-Spangled Fish Emblem for their vehicle. Can you imagine driving through town and seeing 5 out of every 10 cars with the emblem on it? He went on to say: I assure you, they will take notice! Just like in any game, when the defense makes a big play, it strikes fear in the heart of their opponent. Because a fish on a car is such an instrument of fear and intimidation. Co-opting our flag for a hate-filled purpose is sooooooo totally terrifying that anybody reading this should be quaking in fear right now. Even the LGBT community. Especially the LGBT community. The horror of star-spangled fish adorning a million cars will certainly have all non-believers and sinners cowering before the Christian god, begging for his forgiveness and grace. When you see that fish on someone s car, will you bow down like they expect?Us either.The laughable idea that a silly fish emblem will scare people straight is only part of this, though. The emblems are available at Patriot Depot for $10 (regular price, $12.95) and Patriot Depot is part of, dun dun DUN, Liberty Alliance. The exact same letter that Vallorani sent out to his loyal fans accompanies this overpriced fish emblem, which is pictured below:Isn t that just frightening?This whole thing actually begs the question: Could this  call to arms  be just a way for Liberty Alliance to squeeze money out of their followers? Coerce your loyal followers into buying an overpriced chrome sticker and reap the financial rewards. Or, at least, be able to keep running your site for another day and a half.This email came to Joe My God through Matt Barber s BarbWire, which is one of the many Christian fundie websites that are part of Liberty Alliance. That, predictably, is made up of people who only want liberty for themselves.Also predictably, they have an astonishingly hypocritical description of themselves: Liberty Alliance is a network of web sites dedicated to advancing Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. Given the sites listed on Liberty Alliance s website, including BarbWire, Freedom Outpost, Allen West Republic, Minutemen News, Patriot Tribune, Girls Just Wanna Have Guns, Red Right Republic and more, it s very, very clear that they mean  life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness  only for themselves, and fuck everyone who doesn t fall in line. Those people can perish in hell.We ll be rolling our eyes and giggling uncontrollably the whole way down through those fiery gates. Liberty Alliance no doubt believes that they ve come up with a fool-proof way to make money off their followers and get the added benefit of scaring the LGBT community into oblivion. Their efforts will likely prove fruitless.Featured image via LinkedIn",News,"August 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 HILARIOUS: What A Trump Ad For Black Voters Would REALLY Look Like (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s presidential campaign has been trying hard to convince the media and (white) voters that he is wholeheartedly making an appeal to black voters. But in reality the Trump attempt to speak about the issues that black Americans have been insulting and ham-fisted at best.Taking that into consideration, Conan O Brien broadcast an ad poking fun at what Trump outreach to black voters would really look like:Like the real Trump campaign s efforts, the hilarious ad comes across more as something that a white person who has never interacted with a black person would come up with. It starts out echoing Trump in the way he has argued that black people have terrible lives, then ratchets up to point out different ways that Trump could pander to black voters   including appointing Denzel Washington to run the FAA.The comedic bit points out how bad the actual Trump work has been, showcasing just how little attention Trump gives to how real black Americans are dealing with life. Instead, Trump treats these voters as simpletons who are looking to him to be their savior. His pitch has literally been to ask black voters what else they have to lose, a far cry from a positive sales job.And black voters are   understandably   not responding to the Trump come-on. Polls show that Trump is on track to have less black vote support in the election than either John McCain or Mitt Romney did in their elections, although President Obama was on the ballot in those contests.Some polling in swing states has shown Trump polling at zero percent with black voters. They have largely been turned off by a campaign using the most nakedly racist appeals seen in such an effort since the pro-segregation  Dixiecrat  party was a player in the 1960s.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Support For Hillary Probably Just Got This Texas Family’s Dog Killed (VIDEO),"It s not surprising that Hillary Clinton signs don t last long in tomato red Richardson, Texas, but this is not a normal political year and heated rhetoric and violence have become so commonplace that a family dog might be the victim of a political disagreement.Matt Steadman and his wife are proud Hillary Clinton supporters. They ve put up yard sign after yard sign after yard sign (three) and each one disappeared almost as fast as they appeared. That didn t surprise Steadman, who said it was,  no big deal. Then, things changed. It began with sign stuck under their door that said  Hillary for Prison 2016.  Then, their SUV was vandalized with bleach in the gas tank. The car can t be repaired. Smelled the inside of my gas tank and there was bleach,  said Steadman.  I ve never heard about bleach and gas tanks and cars. Source: CBS DFWThen things got even worse, much worse. The Steadman s adorable 2-year-old Shepard mix named Abby got sick. She started tremoring and she started shaking, I called Beth around 4 and said  I think somethings wrong with Abby.   Abby had ingested a neurotoxin and there was nothing the veterinarian could do. She started tremoring and she started shaking, I called Beth around 4 and said  I think somethings wrong with Abby.   Abby didn t make it.Here s the video:The Steadmans don t know for sure that the same people who targeted their signs also targeted their SUV and killed their dog, but it s a pretty logical leap. They also don t know for sure that these people are Trump supporters, but that is also a pretty logical leap.Trump rallies are turning into a page out of Lord of the Flies. At any given time, you can hear the audience, spurred on by the GOP candidate, chanting,  lock her up  and  kill her.  Trump himself hinted at Clinton s assassination when he compelled  Second Amendment people  to  do something  about Clinton. In other words, watch for violence, like that that was perpetrated against sweet Abby, to escalate before it gets better.As for the Steadmans, well, the police are dropping the ball. They aren t investigating.Featured image via video screen capture.

" Ryan Lochte Is About To Be Rewarded For His Douchebaggery, And It’s Gonna Piss You Off","You d think we would no longer be surprised when an athlete or someone famous gets away with being in trouble, especially a white, male athlete. However, nope, this is still pretty damn awful.After Ryan Lochte s drunken douchebaggery vandalizing a gas station in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, then subsequently lying about it, and then getting away with it, he s now likely about to join the ABC hit show Dancing with the Stars.According to US Weekly: Multiple sources tell Us Weekly that Ryan Lochte signed on for season 23 of Dancing With the Stars following his Rio robbery scandal, in which he said he overexaggerated  his story about being robbed at gunpoint. Apparently, an  insider  has said: Doing DWTS will be great for Ryan s image! He will be able to show America that he s a good guy who made a mistake. He s still an Olympic champion! He will be great on the show. A good guy who made a mistake.  Ha!It must be nice to be able to get away with that sort of behavior and then given the opportunity to make money with a reality television celebrity dance competition show.The cast for the upcoming season hasn t been announced but according to US,  reps for the show never comment on casting rumors, but this season will likely include a few Olympic athletes. And unfortunately, a scandal always intrigues the masses and people would likely tune in to see a douchebag act like a fool on the dance floor. Who cares about principles, really?Lochte did apologize, saying: I want to apologize for my behavior last weekend   for not being more careful and candid in how I described the events of that early morning and for my role in taking the focus away from the many athletes fulfilling their dreams of participating in the Olympics. So, basically, he s sorry he got caught. He also did a sorry, not sorry, because he added: It s traumatic to be out late with your friends in a foreign country   with a language barrier   and have a stranger point a gun at you and demand money to let you leave You still lied about it, Lochte, and you re a 32-year-old man   grow up.We, as a society, really need to stop rewarding those who do bad things. It perpetuates the dialogue, the very true dialogue, that some are above the law and not worth of condemnation, and in some cases, punishment.Hopefully, it s just a rumor that Lochte with appear on the ABC hit show, but if not, maybe they ll come to their senses and choose someone else who children can look up to.Featured Photo by Matt Hazlett/Getty Images",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Shady Medical Note Was Written By A ‘Doctor’ With False Credentials (VIDEO),"The GOP has been having a field day spreading false rumors about Hillary Clinton s health, and it looks like karma has finally arrived. On Tuesday morning, CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta called out Donald Trump s personal  doctor  after noticing a questionable note about the  extraordinary  health of the Republican nominee.Trump s doctor, Dr. Harold Bornstein, had previously said that Trump would  be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency    but Gupta was here to dispel that statement. Delving into Bornstein s sketchy history, Gupta told host Chris Cuomo: He s been a doctor with Trump for 36 years, between him and his father. He says he s a fellow of the American College of Gastroenterology, so a GI doc. Interestingly, we called that particular organization (and) they said he was a member   but he hasn t been a member there in over 20 years, since  95 now. Suddenly, Trump s medical records and his physician seem just as untrustworthy as his campaign   and yet no one should be surprised because Trump s campaign has been entirely comprised of lies and scams.The letter Gupta is referring to is a note which Trump released instead of real medical records (not sketchy at all, right?).BornsteinIn examining the letter closely, Gupta said his instincts were set off by the fact that the  doctor  had used the word  positive  as a synonym for normal and several other terms in the letter didn t seem right. To top it all off, Gupta discovered that the younger Bornstein wasn t telling the truth about his credentials, either: In fact, the hospital, Lenox Hill Hospital, says he s part of the section of gastroenterology   he s not actually a member of that section. He does have admitting privileges at the hospital but he s not (part of that section). So there are some things in the letter with regard to his qualifications that are a little bit questionable. Really, it was more, sort of, the language of this letter that I thought was quite surprising. It wasn t written the way that many typical medical letters are written.

 Desperate Lindsey Graham Calls Clinton Foundation Controversy A “Gift From The Political Gods” (VIDEO),"Senator Lindsey Graham has had an on-again, off-again relationship with Donald Trump, having first condemned and opposed the Republican nominee, then endorsed, un-endorsed, tried to get his other GOP buddies to also stop supporting him, and now he seems to be back on the Trump bandwagon in hopes that by getting The Donald elected, Republicans can keep the Senate.That s why Graham is particularly thrilled about a recent report on the Clinton Foundation that outlines that  more than half of the private individuals who met with Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State were also donors to the Clinton Foundation in some capacity  and that Clinton had given those donors favorable treatment.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Graham celebrated this  gift from the political gods , claiming that this might actually help Trump  close the gap  with the Democratic nominee   but only if Trump plays his cards right (and we all know what the slim chances of that happening are). Graham said: If Mr. Trump can up his game   and he is, he s doing much better. If he can control   if he can close the gap I think the chance of keeping the Senate goes up. Graham also criticized the Clinton report, saying that it reeks of wrong, it reeks of insider benefits, the inside versus the outside, and Trump represents the outside and he s in a pretty good spot.  Obviously, Graham isn t considering that Trump s own business and charity record is filled with unethical, fraudulent activity.This interview gets somewhat comical when Graham said, with a straight face, that if only Trump could harness his  temperament , demonstrate  judgment  and show that he was  qualified  to be the next President of the United States, he might be able to make the Republican Party proud. Unfortunately, we all know that Trump is just going to disappoint Graham and break his heart   again.You can watch the interview below:Featured image via Darren McCollester / Getty Images",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Video Proof Trump Just Absolutely Lied About His Crowd Size While Speaking,"During Donald Trump s most recent rally in Tampa, Florida, he went on and one about the size of his dick crowd. As if that is representative of poll numbers, which ironically show him losing nationwide.Because the cameras shooting the event didn t show the entire crowd size, Trump thought it wise to say that the room was packed to the corners and beats any crowd his opponent Hillary Clinton gets.What Trump didn t think to realize would be that reporters, like the Washington Post s Ed O Keefe, would quickly prove Trump to be a pants on fire liar McLiarface.Watch O Keefe s video here:VIDEO (again): Trump state fair hall not packed full as he falsely claims. pic.twitter.com/RqnKoPJzHz  Ed O'Keefe (@edatpost) August 24, 2016Not only is Trump lying, he s doing a horrific job of it. It s as if he doesn t think any of the press would quickly scan the room to notice that the room not only isn t packed but is barely filled at all.It s amazing that Trump will tout lie after lie after lie and his supporters eat it up with a spoon. All the while believing that it s Hillary Clinton who is the actual liar. Even though she was found to be the most fundamentally honest candidate out of anyone who ran on either side.You can, quite literally, listen to Trump and everything out of his mouth speaking against Hillary is what someone has said about him. It s classic projecting and it s not even hidden well. It s actually quite sad that so many are still falling for it. However, those people vote and we need to make sure to get out the vote ourselves and make sure Trump doesn t get anywhere near the Oval Office.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Catholic Insurance Company Refused To Allow Woman With IUD To Be Treated,"It s not even a slight exaggeration to say that when the Supreme Court decided that right-wing religious bigotry can take precedence above pretty much everything else, including common sense, they were setting some people up to die.28-year-old Melanie Jones, who lives near Chicago, didn t die, but only because she was lucky. She made the mistake of visiting her doctor, one her healthcare plan wanted her to visit, when she began bleeding heavily because her IUD became dislodged. Her doctor refused to remove her IUD, even though something more dire could still happen, because the doctor was Catholic. I think my first feeling was shock,  Jones told Rewire in an interview.  I thought that eventually they were going to recognize that my health was the top priority. It wasn t just her doctor. According to Jones and two complaints filed by the ACLU, the entire hospital couldn t help Jones out because it was a Catholic hospital. In fact, no one in her entire insurance network could help her. She had no idea that she had signed up with a Catholic healthcare network (Blue Cross Blue Shield).The doctor left Jones to confer with colleagues, before returning to confirm that her  hands [were] tied,  according to two complaints filed by the ACLU of Illinois. Not only could she not help her, the doctor said, but no one in Jones  health insurance network could remove the IUD, because all of them followed similar restrictions. Mercy, like many Catholic providers, follows directives issued by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that restrict access to an array of services, including abortion care, tubal ligations, and contraception.The only way Jones had left to get her IUD removed and to stop the bleeding was to spend $1,000 out of pocket in the emergency room. She did successfully contact the ACLU, who intervened on her behalf with the insurance company. They finally, five days after her initial appointment, found a doctor who would remove the IUD.Now, we all know that current Catholic doctrine, at least how it s currently interpreted, is that birth control is strictly out of the question, but what about removing birth control? That, apparently, is a gray area. Her doctor maybe could have removed the IUD without violating policy, but she apparently didn t want to risk it.Now, to be fair, IUD expulsions are rarely dangerous, but they can perforate organs. There are plenty of situations, though, when saving a life could violate religious law (Christian Scientists don t believe in blood transfusions, any religious person can claim they can t treat an LGBT person, or sometimes even an LGBT couple s children).Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Caught Illegally Buying $55,000 Worth Of His Own Book… With Campaign Donations","Donald Trump has been caught buying $55,000 worth of his own books and he paid this hefty bill with money from campaign donations, which is flat out illegal if he gets any royalties from the sales.As reported by The Daily Beast: On May 10, the Trump campaign paid Barnes & Noble $55,055, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. That amounts to more than 3,500 copies of the hardcover version of Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again, or just over 5,000 copies of the renamed paperback release, Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America. According to a spokesperson for Trump, these books were purchased for gift bags given to delegates at the Republican National Convention. Indeed, delegates did each receive a copy of Crippled America along with miscellaneous Make America Great Again gear and a plastic fetus, all neatly stuffed into tote bags bearing the same trademark slogan.But here is where the problem lies, under Federal Elections Committee rules, Trump cannot legally be paid royalties on the books bought by the campaign. Paul Ryan (not the one you are thinking of), from the nonpartisan nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, explains: It s fine for a candidate s book to be purchased by his committee, but it s impermissible to receive royalties from the publisher,  Ryan said.  That amounts to an illegal conversion of campaign funds to personal use. There s a well established precedent from the FEC that funds from the campaign account can t end up in your own pocket. Neither the Trump campaign nor the book s publisher, Simon & Schuster, has been willing to comment. Regardless, federal campaign law clearly states that campaign spending cannot  result in the conversion of campaign funds to the personal use of the candidate or any other person. It may be the case for a candidate to instead donate those royalties to charity that might be a permissible arrangement,  said the CLC s Ryan.  But the bottom line is, no money of this $55,000 from the book can end up in Donald Trump s pocket without violating federal law. It isn t exactly unusual for celebrities or politicians to buy copies of their own books, or to give them away. However, Ben Bruton, who has spent the past 25 years working in publishing public relations, the circumstances surrounding Trump s purchase is suspicious. What any author that I know would most likely do is go to the publisher and say,  I want a bunch of these in the goody bag.  [The author would] come to the publisher and say he needed books for a charity or an event, and we would donate 500 all the time. And we ll sell more to you at a 40 percent discount,  said Bruton. The red flag, I think, would be that they re trying to get back on The[New York] Times Best Sellers list, or they re trying to buy them at retail for royalties. If Trump s books were bought at a brick and mortar store like Barnes and Noble, then they will count towards best-seller lists. I ve worked at four different of the major six publishing houses and a lot of times people want to buy a bunch of books to get on the list. You can t do it from Amazon. You can t buy them from the publisher,  said Bruton.  Only buying from place likes Barnes & Noble at full price is looked at as sales. Bruton added that at least the Times list is aware of the possibility of authors buying their way to the top with bulk sales and has penalties in place to prevent this. That s how the Times keeps that sort of in check, so you can t just buy your way onto the Best Sellers list,  he said. However, I do believe that was definitely an attempt to both make money and to get onto the best-seller list,  Bruton added.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Children’s Home Rejects Atheist’s Cash Donation Because He’s Not A Christian,"A children s home in Oklahoma literally refused to take a donation from a man because he isn t a Christian.The Murrow Indian Children s Home claims to care about helping orphaned children but when Matt Wilbourn tried to make a $100 donation on behalf of the Muskogee Atheist Community an employee called him and rejected his donation. I filed out the paperwork and I put my wife and I s name on the paperwork,  Wilbourn recounted.  At the bottom, it asks if there is any person or organization you want to put it in memory of and I put the Muskogee Atheist Community. She called my desk phone at work and told me that they would not be accepting our donation because it would go against everything they believe in,  he continued.Founded in 1865 by Reverend J.S. Murrow to take in and care for orphaned Native American children, the home was taken over by the American Baptist Mission Home Societies and moved to Bacone College in Muskogee, where it houses dozens of children in need of a home.In 2014, it was reported that the Murrow Children s Home was in desperate need of supplies including  laundry detergent, 13-gallon garbage bags, sandwich bags, one-gallon and quart freezer bags, serving tongs, snacks, toothpaste, band aides, dishwashing soap, napkins, Comet cleaner, Pine Sol, Lysol, bleach, furniture polish and storage bags. So if any organization needs donations, it s the Murrow Children s Home. And that s what makes their rejection of Wilbourn s donation so outrageous.He donated $100, which would go a long way toward purchasing many of the items on that list.But his donation was rejected simply because he isn t a Christian, which makes one wonder just exactly what the Murrow Children s Home employees are teaching the kids in their care.Undeterred, Wilbourn came up with an idea. In fact, it s a fantastic idea.He decided to start a GoFundMe with the support of the Muskogee Atheist Community to raise more money for the Children s Home to see exactly how much money it will take for them to ignore his non-belief and accept the donation.But it appears the Murrow Home cares more about religion than they do about making sure the children have everything they need. I emailed the director of the Murrow Home and told her that I m raising the amount to $250,  Wilbourn said.  No reply from her. So far, the GoFundMe has raised a whopping $5,612 and the Murrow Home still won t accept because Wilbourn and his group are atheists. It s taken food off their plate, clothes off their back and shelter over their heads,  Wilbourn said.It s truly sad that an organization would reject perfectly good donations just because the person doing the giving is not a Christian. That amounts to stealing from children. The Murrow Home is a non-profit so clearly they are only able to care for children solely out of the kindness of people who open their wallets and donate money. The Bible says  judge not lest ye be judged  and there s this part called the  Golden Rule  that commands us to treat people the way we want to be treated. Thus far, the  Christians  at the Murrow Home have failed to adhere to both. They judged Wilbourn to be a bad person because he s an atheist and even when he treated them with kindness and generosity the Murrow Home continued to do the opposite to him.Frankly, it sounds like these kids need new caretakers because the Murrow Home is clearly failing them and their best interests.To contact the Murrow Home, visit their Facebook page.To contribute to the GoFundMe, click here. Because even if the Murrow Home rejects the amount raised, it will still go toward a great cause called Camp Quest, which is a non-religious summer camp for kids.Murrow Home ought to be ashamed of themselves for choosing bigotry and hate over the well-being of the kids they claim to care about.Featured Image: Facebook",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Delusional Trump Campaign Manager Makes Craziest Claim Yet To Deny Trump Is Losing,"This is the craziest explanation of why Donald Trump is getting his ass handed to him in the polls and you have to hear it for yourself.The Republican nominee s newst campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was interviewed by the UK s Channel 4, where she was grilled about Trump s poll numbers and whether he can really win.Once again, Trump s minion dismissed the polls as being  cherry-picked  by the media because they supposedly want to destroy him.Conway claimed that online polls are more accurate because they allegedly show Trump in the lead and she argued that college students are keeping their support of Trump secret so they aren t alienated on campus. Donald Trump performs consistently better in online polling where a human being is not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the election. It s because it s become socially desirable, if you re a college educated person in the United States of America, to say that you re against Donald Trump. The problem with online polls, however, is that anyone can take them and they can be easily skewed if a bunch of people take it with the intention of making the results lean one way or the other. In short, they aren t scientific, like real polls conducted by CNN, Gallup, NBC, and Quinnipiac, all of which show Trump losing badly to Hillary Clinton.Furthermore, polls are anonymous so there is no need to hide one s support of a candidate. But polls overwhelmingly show that Trump is getting trounced by Hillary among young voters, so it s pretty clear why Conway would make any excuse to explain the wide gap there.Conway then claimed that Trump will win the election in November because most of his voters are supposedly  undercover. Yeah, you read that right. She literally said Trump has  undercover voters  that are in hiding until they can rush to the voting booth and cast their votes. The hidden Trump vote in this country is a very significant proposition,  she said.When asked if she has numbers to back up her claims, Conway said she does but refused to share them. I can t discuss it,  Conway said.  It s a project we re doing internally. I call it the undercover Trump voter, but it s real. Here s the video via Youtube:Someone get this woman a straight jacket and a rubber room, because this claim is as delusional as the claim that the government will send black helicopters to whisk critics away in the middle of the night or that the government is going to take way all of our guns.Seriously, this a crock of bullshit. The idea that voters are  undercover  is totally ridiculous. Donald Trump s campaign is imploding and the best his new campaign manager can do is cite the vote of imaginary voters as proof that Trump will win? It s pathetic and it sounds like Trump needs yet another new campaign manager.Featured image via screenshot",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Stephen Colbert HUMILIATES Rudy Giuliani With A Diagnosis Of His Own,"Rudy Giuliani s health insurance won t cover this burn.The former New York City mayor who now forgets about 9/11 has been repeatedly peddling conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton s health on behalf of Donald Trump, insisting that she is too sick to be president and the only proof he offers is to tell people to go on the Internet and do a search on Google.During The Late Show on Tuesday night, Stephen Colbert took Giuliani to the woodshed for spreading unsubstantiated bullshit. Yes, Rudy Giuliani says just diagnose Hillary on the Internet,  Colbert said.  Because if it s on the internet you know it s true. For instance, I put my symptoms into WebMD and found out I have menopause. Colbert then did exactly what Giuliani told everyone to do and found hilarious results.As it turns out, the first thing Colbert found was a video of Giuliani saying that Hillary is sick. And that led to Colbert hilariously diagnosing Giuliani. So, let me get this straight, let me explain this to you. Here s what s happening: Giuliani says she s not healthy and then look it up on the Internet. And when you look it up on the Internet it says Giuliani says she s not healthy and to look it up on the Internet. It s like it s an endless loop. It s like a snake with its tail in its mouth. Or a man with his head up his own ass. Trump and his minions have been pushing the lie about Clinton s health for weeks now. Fox News host Sean Hannity started this witch hunt when he interpreted a video of Hillary being playful and joking around as her having seizures, something which a real journalist who has real seizures called him out for in Newsweek.And then Giuliani started peddling the conspiracy theory despite the fact that it has been thoroughly debunked. Even Hillary s own doctor released a detailed statement on her overall health.Colbert opined that Giuliani and Trump know so much about Hillary s health because they are  experts on female anatomy,  which he  proved  by showing a video of Giuliani dressed in drag being motorboated by the Republican nominee. You re going to want to verify that video. Just go online and put down  Donald Trump Rudy Giuliani motorboat,  Colbert quipped.But Colbert saved the most devastating diagnosis for last, and let s just say the truth is going to hurt Trump and Giuliani below the belt. I don t know why they keep saying things like  frail  or  weak  or  low-energy.  You re just tip-toeing around the medical condition that you re really upset about. One that she has that no other president in history has ever faced. Hillary Clinton has chronic  no penis. Here s the video via YouTube.Republicans need to stop peddling their false claims about Hillary s health. They are not real doctors and claiming that every little twitch or cough somehow disqualifies her from being president is completely asinine. FDR suffered from polio and led the nation through the Great Depression and World War II and served longer than any other president in American history. Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke while in office and served out his second term. Dwight Eisenhower had a serious heart attack in 1955 and a mild stroke in 1957 but still was re-elected in 1956 and served his second term. Ronald Reagan underwent surgery several times to remove cancer.By Trump and Giuliani s logic, none of these men should have ever been president simply because of their various health problems, and those health issues were verifiable facts, not the garbage Republicans are claiming now about Hillary Clinton s health.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Plans To Destroy Trump In Upcoming Speech Tying Him To ‘Disturbing’ Alt-Right,"The alt-right political movement is not something most mainstream voters know much about, but this year it is imperative that they do. This brand of conservativism is one that is disturbing on many levels, and made up of neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and other assorted racist extremists. What s more is that Steve Bannon, head of the insanely bigoted conservative website Breitbart, is now heading up Donald Trump s campaign for president. Therefore, Hillary Clinton is planning to do the people of America a favor this coming Thursday and give a speech educating the people on this fringe movement that is definitely a big player in the Trump campaign.The Clinton campaign says of the speech: This  alt-right  brand is embracing extremism and presenting a divisive and dystopian view of America which should concern all Americans, regardless of party. They go on to remind everyone that Trump s entire campaign staff is made up of people who embrace this bigoted garbage. Indeed, this is something that used to be on the fringes, in the bowels of the interwebs where only basement-dwelling imbeciles who embrace the new white supremacy even knew anything about this largely online  movement. However, Donald Trump has changed all of that, and empowered these dangerous idiots to come into the light. They see him as an inspiration. They have definitely picked up on Trump s dog whistling. After all, we all know that  Make America Great Again,  is really just code for  Make America WHITE Again.  Despite Trump s recent pathetic efforts to reach out to minority voters, we all know what he is REALLY doing   trying to make white people uncomfortable with such blatant racism believe he s just not-racist enough for them to be able to pull the lever for him this November.Thank you, Secretary Clinton, for this public service. Hopefully, people listen.Featured image via Mark Makela/Getty Images",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Pop Legend Cher BURNS Trump in GLORIOUS Takedown: ‘He’s A F*cking Idiot’,"Cher is a legend among pop singers. She is also no fan of Donald Trump. The gorgeous pop diva has fully endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and is now hitting the campaign trail to make sure that Clinton defeats the racist, bigoted demagogue that the Republicans have nominated. In her latest attack, Cher appeared at a Clinton event in Provincetown, Massachusetts and issues a blistering indictment of Donald Trump. She said: I just think he s a f ing idiot. Cher was just getting started with that one, though. She went on to say that Trump s  Make America Great Again  campaign slogan is what we all know it to be: coded language to bring back the times when straight, white, Christians ruled all and women stayed in their place, saying He means we want to make America straight and white. Truer words were never spoken with regards to Trump s travesty of a presidential run, but Cher wasn t done yet. She continued: He just says like the weirdest sh-t. And also, I love this, he s like  L-G-B-T   and Q?  Like he just learned it, you know? Cher went on to invoke Fun with Dick and Jane, a throwback series from the 1970s: It s like  Racist Fun with Dick and Jane.  We re going to build walls! After that, Cher turned her sights to praising Hillary Clinton, and again warning of the dangers of Trump: I believe in her so much,  Cher said, referring to Clinton. I know that if he got into office, our world would be the worst place,  Cher said.  I don t think we could imagine how bad it could get. If breaking news ever happened and he had to go to the podium, we would just all go f k. She s right, of course. As an American who takes pride in and loves my country, I really, really hope that this scenario never comes to life.Watch the epic remarks below:Featured image via Cher Twitter",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You Really Don’t Want To Miss This Drag Queen Interviewing Trump Minions (VIDEO),"When thinking about who would be the perfect person to send to a Donald Trump campaign rally to interview supporters, there really is no one better than Drag Queen Courtney Act, previously of Rupaul s Drag Race.She left the comforts of Provincetown, MA, and went over to Fairfield, CT, to talk to Trump minions.It was there that she met all sorts of interesting folks  Islamophobes, racists, misogynists  You know, pretty much everyone you think you d find at a Trump rally.Courtney talked to quite a few people, including a man with  Trump that B*tch  t-shirts, another man with a  Made in China  Trump hat, as well as a white supremacy group, but one woman really embodied everything Trump.This lady told Courtney: It doesn t matter what your religion is, but I do believe that the Muslim is not a religion. I believe it s more of a cult and if people got together and sacrificed a human baby or sacrificed a woman at the stake, I would say that people would probably say that s not a good religion. Like Satanic cults, for instance, they re not legal in our country and therefore I don t believe Sharia law should be legal either. Besides all the factual inaccuracies and crazy within all that, it doesn t quite seem to be understandable English either. And she calls herself American.One of the best parts of the video was when some protesters at the rally recognized Courtney from her time on Rupaul s Drag Race. It was probably a nice relief for her to run into sane people in that crowd of nincompoops.All in all, this video is pretty damn hilarious, yet it s still kinda scary knowing there are people in the U.S. who think this way. However, these people vote. Which is all the more reason to make sure we all get out this November and VOTE BLUE.Watch the video here:https://www.facebook.com/junkeedotcom/videos/971933766252421/Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CNN Guests Get Into INSANE Fight Over Trump’s Black Outreach: ‘You’re Supporting A Bigot!’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has been raising a lot of eyebrows lately with his new and pathetic attempts to win over African American voters, despite the fact that he only has about 2 percent of the black vote as of right now. As usual, Trump s delivery has been nothing but problematic, because he s been giving his speeches to mostly-white crowds in mostly-white areas because he doesn t feel safe in urban neighborhoods. This sparked a conversation on CNN that erupted into a heated exchange of words between guests Charles Blow and Bruce LeVell.Don Lemon started the discussion by rolling a ridiculous clip of Trump claiming that he would be able to win 95 percent of the black vote after he serves four years in the White House. LeVell, who was representing the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, got into an argument with Blow so intense that Lemon could hardly contain it and the two men forced CNN to skip a commercial break.Many of the two guests  jabs at each other were delivered in low voices but things got extra heated when Blow, a New York Times columnist, accurately called Trump out for being a bigot and then accused LeVell for supporting bigotry. LeVell responded by trying to place blame on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign by saying that they had purposely portrayed Trump to look like a bigot. This was all too much for Blow to handle. He erupted and laid into LeVell: I m not part of the Clinton campaign. I m a black man in America and I know a bigot when I see a bigot and you are supporting a bigot and that makes you part of the bigotry that s Donald Trump. LeVell fired back,  I know someone who doesn t tell the truth on national TV when I see it, sir. Lemon eventually had to jump in and mediate, and was probably thankful that his guests hadn t been in the same studio for this discussion.

 GOP Lobbyist Takes A COMPLETELY Unexpected Step In Order To Take Down Trump,"A GOP lobbyist who s known for his own brand of bigotry has denounced Trump in a completely unprecedented way. Instead of vowing to vote for Hillary, or, at least, saying Trump isn t fit to be president like other Republicans have, he s actually called on Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate Trump for corruption.Yes, he really did that. Jack Burkman, who s president of his own lobbying firm, is primarily concerned with Trump s penchant for expecting favors from people to whom he s donated campaign money. In fact, as LawNewz said, he used that exact thing to prove that our political system is broken during the first GOP debate in August of last year: I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. He also said those words to Rolling Stone. Other instances of Trump s admissions to possible corruption are listed in Burkman s letter to Lynch, including an interview with the Wall Street Journal, and when he formally accepted the Republican nomination for president. Trump has made a habit of talking about how he knows that lawmakers will do anything for anyone who gives them money.Burkman, who wrote the letter on his lobbying firm s stationery, said: In Florida, Attorney General Pam Bondi considered joining a New York suit against the real estate mogul over the allegedly fraudulent Trump University. Ms. Bondi received a $25,000 donation to her campaign. And Florida did not join that suit against Trump University. An aide to Bondi said that she actually solicited that donation, which makes it worse.As galling as it is to side with a Republican lobbyist on anything at all, Burkman is making a good point. While nobody can make specific accusations of corruption against Trump right now, just the situation in Florida is very suspicious. It s so suspicious that Burkman isn t the only person to call for an investigation into that. Boston attorney Whitfield Larrabee has called on the IRS to investigate that, too, since the donation came from Trump s non-profit foundation.When combined with his bragging that he s repeatedly gamed the system, along with all the money he s given to other lawmakers representing districts in which he s got business interests, it paints a very grim picture indeed.It s not like we don t have an idea that Trump is corrupt. That s almost a given at this point. What s surprising is that we have a GOP lobbyist calling on a Democratic attorney general, appointed by a president that Republicans hate with the fire of a thousand suns, to investigate the man at the top of their ticket.Burkman concluded his letter with this: If Mr. Trump has never engaged in any political corruption, why would he repeatedly gloat about his gaming of the system? If he did, then he should be investigated, prosecuted and if convicted, imprisoned.The blatant effusive nature of his public statements should be considered nothing short of a challenge to the U.S. Department of Justice and whether the agency would bother to investigate whether he has, In fact, crossed the line between politics as usual and corruption. Lynch should at least take this seriously enough to look into it. There s just too much there to ignore.Featured image by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images ",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Congressional Black Caucus Condemns Trump: He’s A Racist Who Cozies Up To White Supremacists,"Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) condemned Donald Trump and his unbelievably tone-deaf attempt at African-American  outreach,  slamming him as a racist who has spent his entire campaign cozying up to white supremacists.The CBC convened a conference call on Tuesday to denounce Trump, and accused his campaign of not only perpetuating stereotypes but also deliberately dog whistling to white supremacists in an effort to turn their bigotry into votes.Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) said that the Republican nominee is  one of the most racist, sexist and bigoted candidates  to launch a bid for the White House in modern history, and accused Trump of having a  kinship with white supremacists. He knows the audience he s trying to reach out to and it s not African-Americans,  Meeks said.  He s trying to appeal to David Duke and the racists of the world with what they think are stereotypes.   He s trying to appeal to the worst of the white supremacists and others he s been catering to in the campaign to try and help them with turnout. In the past few days, Trump has attempted to pander to minority voters but has done an exceedingly poor job of it. In an effort to garner votes from African-Americans he claimed that their communities are  war zones  and that they live in fear of being shot at any moment. Trump s big selling point was that since black Americans live in poverty, have poor education, and a lack of job opportunities they might as well vote for him. After all, it isn t like they have anything to lose, right?Trump s blatant racism and p*ss poor excuse for minority outreach aren t going over well with African-American voters or lawmakers.CBC Chairman G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) blasted Trump for giving speeches supposedly meant to draw black voters to crowds that are overwhelmingly white and said that the GOP nominee s so-called outreach is  a slap in the face  to the African-American community. If Donald Trump truly cared about African-Americans, he d disavow his long history of hateful and racist attacks against our community, he d apologize for having discriminated against black families   he d disavow his support for white supremacists and white supremacy,  Butterfield said.The Democrats taking part in Tuesday s call ripped Trump s past history of discriminatory housing practices during his years as a real estate investor and his habit of exploiting minority workers as a builder.They noted that his campaign has been littered with bigotry from the very beginning when he announced his candidacy by calling all Mexicans  rapists.  Since then, he has been reluctant to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke, called for all Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, accused a judge of being incapable of impartiality because of his Mexican heritage, and has refused to believe that President Obama was born in America.In response to Trump and his racist rhetoric, Democrats say they are pushing their minority voter registration efforts into overdrive and plan to set records with black and Hispanic turnout at the polls in November. To say that minority voters are eager to cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton to make sure that Trump never gets anywhere near the White House would be an understatement. Donald Trump is a voter registration machine and a citizenship-advocating engine,  said Rep. Luis Guti rrez (D-Ill.).  This is a little bit of thank you, because our community has never been so united or energized since that moment you set foot in national arena. Trump has said repeatedly that he will do great with African-Americans and Hispanics. It is hard to know what in the world ever gave him that idea, but his  outreach  isn t helping his cause and surely won t convince minority voters to turn a blind eye to the fact that he has built his entire campaign on bigotry.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Right-Wing Radio Host Gets Owned By Neil deGrasse Tyson For Lying About Him,"Note to conservatives who want to pretend to be journalists: be sure that where you get your information is not a satirical site, or you ll be humiliated like this idiot.This is especially true if you decide to attack a professional scientist, because if you haven t done your research properly you can rest assured they will discover that fact when they research your claims.In this case, that s exactly what popular scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson did to right-wing radio host Neal Larson this week after the conservative mouthpiece repeated the charge that Tyson  mocked  a little girl for wanting to live on Jupiter, a planet where no human could survive.The alleged  mocking  supposedly took place in front of a crowd and on Twitter, Larson crowed in the vicious hit job on Tyson and his character in an op-ed criticizing Tyson for simply inserting math into the Olympic medal count. The scientist pointed out that while America earned more medals than Hungary, Hungary is actually beating us when we adjust to account for total population. Then the victory for medals to population ratio goes to Hungary.Larson believes this is Tyson attacking America when in reality he was only stating a mathematical fact that also happenes to be interesting.Larson went on to whine about Tyson because he constantly calls out conservatives for getting science wrong. He also attempted to assassinate Tyson s character by using the following tale as an example. I ve listened to Neil deGrasse Tyson before. And what I observe is a smart guy who consistently enjoys asserting his intellectual supremacy over others more than he actually likes educating. In one of his worse moments, Tyson mocked a 12-year-old girl who suggested she d like to live on Jupiter. He ridiculed her in the midst of a crowd, then later, several times, on Twitter. That told me everything I needed to know about Neil deGrasse Tyson.For that moment he was just a horse s astrophysicist. The only problem is that the story never actually happened, and Tyson schooled Larson for it. The  incident  with a 9yr old girl never happened,  Tyson responded.And he s right. As it turns out, the story relayed by Larson is complete satire. It looks to be a hoax,  Tyson continued.  No such tweets ever existed on November 29th, 2015, or on any other day. So you abrogated your journalistic integrity by not verifying what you read in somebody else s article, before using it as a foundational pillar in yours. In short, Larson just got lit up by Tyson and those pesky things called facts that conservatives are allergic to for some reason.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NBC Insults The Hell Out Of Trump With Tagline For New ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s biggest claim to fame, The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice, were endangered last year when he revealed himself to be nothing but a horrible, childish bigot in presidential candidates  clothing. At that time, NBC fired him and began looking at who might replace him, and now they have their answer, along with a very insulting tagline.NBC tapped Arnold Schwarzenegger to replace Trump last fall, but made it official with a new promo they released over the weekend. It says, on The Apprentice s YouTube channel: Brains, brawn and business acumen   we re building a better boss.  [emphasis mine]Ouch. That can be taken several different ways   the most obvious being that they think Schwarzenegger s more rounded personality is a better fit than Trump ever was.That s insulting enough. However, NBC specifically fired Trump over his comments about Mexican immigrants last year, at the same time other companies cut ties with him for the same reason. So this could also be seen as a dig at him for what s proven to be his severe lack of even a modicum of professionalism pretty much anywhere.NBC also won t bring Trump back, even if he loses the election and comes crawling back on his hands and knees. NBC s entertainment chair, Robert Greenblatt, said earlier this month: No. He would never be back on  Celebrity Apprentice,  as long as I m here. Woe to Trump if whatever new business ventures on which he embarks after losing in November fail, just like so many of his other businesses have failed.Rumors are swirling that Trump may be using this election cycle to help launch his own television network, rather than making a serious run at the White House. However, Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka, Trump University, Trump Taj Mahal, and more, were all such dismal failures it s a wonder Trump thinks he can even pull off a new business venture. Despite possibly having help from Roger Ailes and Steve Bannon, a Trump television network might fail just as hard.Oh, Trumplestiltskin. His days of fame are numbered, and NBC is trying to make that number shrink.

 GOP Senator Says Trump Doesn’t Deserve To Win,"Another Republican senator has soured on Donald Trump. First it was Mark Kirk, then it was Susan Collins, and now it s Jeff Flake.Flake, who serves with John McCain from the quickly turning purple Arizona, has for months been holding out an endorsement of Trump, citing concerns over the tone and rhetoric of his campaign and of the candidate himself.Well now Flake has had enough, and has basically thrown up his hands in exasperation. Speaking to an Allstate town hall meeting, Flake told the insurance group: One, I don t think he can win if he continues to run this kind of campaign. And two, I don t think he should win as he continues to campaign as he is, taking the kinds of positions he s taking and the language he s using. Flake, who has publicly denounced Trump multiple times for his comments on Muslims and Mexican immigrants, warned that should Trump continue his dangerous and racist rhetoric, millions of young voters will turn against the GOP for the long haul, not just in November: Only one in five voters under age 35 plans to pull the Republican lever. If we don t change that, we consign ourselves to political oblivion in the future. And we have a candidate that is not reaching out but is instead finding new ways to offend just about every demographic we have out there. The implications will be far bigger than just losing the presidency in November. If anyone should be scared, it s Flake. Arizona is increasingly becoming competitive for Democrats, with the state s rising Hispanic and Latino population close to outnumbering its traditionally white, conservative base. Several polls have Clinton beating Trump by four points, and John McCain is currently trailing Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick in the polls for the upcoming Senate election. Not only is McCain on the verge of losing, Sheriff Joe Arpaio is also trailing in the polls to his Democratic challenger.Flake admits his vocal criticism of Trump may hurt his political future, but he has stood firm, telling reporters  there are a lot of people that appreciate somebody pushing back, too. While John McCain has sold out, Jeff Flake has decided to push back hard against bigotry, racism and fear (for now). Although not a full on condemnation and snub, a welcomed point of view nonetheless.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Former Trump Campaign Manager Says It’s Too Dangerous For Trump To Be Around Black People (VIDEO),"After being fired from the Trump campaign, Trump s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is still spreading hate on behalf of his former boss. This time, when asked about why Trump had virtually no African-Americans at a rally where he was talking about African-Americans, Lewandowski answered that it would be too dangerous to have African-Americans in the crowd. As a campaign manager, wouldn t you want your candidate saying some of these things directly to the people he s supposedly addressing?  Anderson Cooper asked. You know what s amazing to me, is no one remembers Donald Trump went to go have a rally in Chicago at the university,  responded Lewandoski. And do you remember what happened? It was so chaotic, and it was so out of control, Secret Service and the Chicago Police Department told him you could not get in and out of that facility safely, and that rally was canceled. And you showed the footage many times of the individuals who attended that rally. Donald Trump had that rally booked,  Lewandowski said. That is a black community. He went to the heart of Chicago to go and give a speech to the University of Chicago in a campus, which is predominantly African-American, to make that argument. And you know what happened? The campus was overrun, and it was not a safe environment,  he said.Source: The HillThe rally Lewandowski was speaking of occurred in Chicago in March   or rather, it didn t occur in Chicago in March because it was shut down over protests. The largely African-American protesters objected to the violence that has been occurring at Trump rallies, but I guess it s okay if white people are violent.Here s the video:Trump, who has a zero percent approval rating with African-Americans, is trying to appear less racist. Lewandowski isn t helping, but to be fair, neither is Trump. His African-American outreach has been nothing but empty, insulting attempts at pandering. It was Trump, not Lewandowski, who appeared on Bill O Reilly to say that he d give Chicago police carte blanche to do whatever it takes to stop black crime.Perhaps Trump should focus on the crimes that are taking place right under his nose, whether that be the violence at his rallies or the alleged crimes taking place right in his offices.Featured image via video screen capture.

 Ana Navarro Lets Trump Know EXACTLY What Latinos ‘Have To Lose’ By Voting For Him (VIDEO),"Donald Trump and his campaign know that they stand an ice cube s chance in hell at winning the presidential election unless they can sway some of the minority vote. As it stands now the campaign has next to nothing in the realm of that voting block.So, what is Trump doing to try to get some of that vote? He s pandering to African-Americans and Latinos, of course. However, he s doing a terrible job of it.He s literally asking minority voters: What do you have to lose? As though that s all the reasoning they d ever need to vote for him. As if minority voters are going to show up to the voting booth in November, look at the ballot, and say,  eh, why not Trump? What do I have to lose? Well, the answer to that is everything considering Trump is currently endorsed by white supremacists and has regularly compared Latinos to rapists and murderers.Does Trump really think that line is going to work? I mean, he can t be that dumb, right? Who knows, really. Clearly, his current supporters are.Well, not letting Trump get away with being such a pathetic pandering fool, Ana Navarro, a conservative mind you, tells Trump exactly what they have to lose.On CNN Navarro stated: I don t speak for all Hispanics. I speak for myself. Maybe the eighty plus percent of Hispanics who don t approve of him, some of them may agree with me. I think what we have to lose, is our dignity. Our sense of self-worth. I think what we have to lose is our moral compass. I think that if we allow ourselves to vote for a man who has been making textbook racist remarks, and in my book that makes him a racist, for over a year, against Hispanics. Against immigrants. You are voting against your own self-interests. I think that we would lose our political leverage. We would lose any power. If we allow somebody who has been bashing us for over a year to win the presidency. It means the Hispanic vote does not matter. So, that s my answer to Donald Trump. What do we have to lose by voting for you? Our dignity. It really doesn t get more perfect than that. Well said, Ana.Watch Navarro explain what Latinos have to lose by voting for Trump here:.@ananavarro's answer to Donald Trump: ""What we have to lose by voting for you?

 Obama Just SCHOOLED Trump On How To Act Presidential In Louisiana (VIDEO),"Ever since Trump first seized on the flooding in Louisiana as an opportunity to pretend he s presidential, it has been abundantly clear that he has no idea what the f*ck he s doing. Though Gov. John Bel Edwards specifically asked Trump to volunteer or donate rather than show up for a photo op, The Donald has the biggest hands, the best brain, and the hugest ideas, so he popped by anyway to spend about a minute handing out Play Doh and other items to flood victims who were much in need of water, food, clothing, and other items typically needed by people who just lost everything in a natural disaster.Trump has spent a good deal of time whining that President Obama did not immediately rush off to Louisiana, but Obama was simply respecting the wishes of the Governor, who said he d  rather he give us another week or two. And then he can visit. President Obama complied, while Trump showed up anyway. After all, he was busy crafting a narrative that Barack Obama hates flood victims. Isn t that more important?Trump, facing criticism for failing to donate money to help, ultimately gave $100 million to a church run by a hate group leader.On Tuesday, after respecting the Governor s wishes and the needs of the people, President Obama toured the flood-damaged areas. To him, this wasn t a photo op. To him, this was a tragedy whose victims needed as much support as they could get. We are heartbroken by the loss of life,  Obama told reporters after surveying the devastation that left 13 dead, more than 60,000 homes damaged, and more than 106,000 residents in a position that they applied for aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. I think anybody who can see just the streets, much less the inside of the homes here, people s lives have been upended by this flood. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told CNN that $120 million in aid has already been approved. But President Obama made it clear that the effort to fix the damage is only just beginning: Sometimes once the flood waters pass, people s attention spans pass. This is not a one off. This is not a photo-op issue. This is how do you make sure that a month from now, three months from now, six months from now, people still are getting the help that they need. I need all Americans to stay focused on this. If you re watching this today, make sure that you find out how you can help. You can go to volunteers.louisiana.gov, or you can go to fema.gov, or you can go to whitehouse.gov. We ll tell you. We ll direct you how you can help. President Obama is correct. A natural disaster, especially of this scale, is not an excuse to rush there for a photo op. It s a reason for the community and the country to come together to fix things. It s a time for the President to step up and focus on the long-term response rather than looking good for the media   and it s especially not the time to pander to Donald Trump s wishes.Let s hope Trump learns something about acting  presidential  from this.

 Newest WikiLeaks Data Dump Could Literally Be A Death Sentence For Some,"When WikiLeaks arrived on the scene, it seemed to many that they would be the savior of democracy. After all, they have the hacking power to keep the people whose salaries we are paying in check. Unfortunately, it s becoming more and more apparent that WikiLeaks is as self-interested as any one of their targets and they can be far more dangerous. Their latest leak will mean dire consequences and even death to some in Saudi Arabia.Julian Assange and his organization, WikiLeaks, is on a mission to destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. It s suspected that his information has come from Russian hackers   nothing at all democratic there. One of the big problems with Assange, besides his trying to influence an American election, is the fact that his data dumps are indiscriminate   either that or he doesn t care who he hurts. WikiLeaks has apparently outed (or at least made the information searchable) at least one gay man, several rape victims and several people living with HIV. The one gay man we know was outed lives in Saudi Arabia, a country where being gay can call for stoning or worse. They published everything: my phone, address, name, details,  said a Saudi man who told AP he was bewildered that WikiLeaks had revealed the details of a paternity dispute with a former partner.  If the family of my wife saw this   Publishing personal stuff like that could destroy people. In Saudi Arabia, any married man who s caught having sex with a man can be stoned to death.WikiLeak s latest data dumps are about as scatological as the name indicates. There is no respect or even expectation of personal privacy when it comes to WikiLeaks. Many people are finding that their personal medical histories, their phone numbers and other personal information has been released by WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks has indiscriminately targeted sick children, abuse survivors and the mentally ill.The AP independently found three dozen records pertaining to family issues in the cables   including messages about marriages, divorces, missing children, elopements and custody battles. Many are very personal, like the marital certificates which reveal whether the bride was a virgin. Others deal with Saudis who are deeply in debt, including one man who says his wife stole his money. One divorce document details a male partner s infertility. Others identify the partners of women suffering from sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C.It s bad enough that Julian Assange is attempting to put his finger on the scale of our electoral system, but when he starts outing private citizens, he should lose everyone s trust.Featured image via Carl Court/Getty Images",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Contradicts Himself In Latest Whiny Tweet, And It’s Pretty Damn Hilarious (TWEET)","In case you haven t noticed, because maybe you ve been living away at sea with no contact to the rest of humanity, Donald Trump likes to tweet a lot, especially about what he loves the most   the media.Oh, he ll say he hates the media, but he s been given hundreds and hundreds of free press coverage hours and air time to spew his hatred and lies, you d think, maybe sometimes, that the media was pulling for Trump to win.However, Trump doesn t see it that way. He doesn t like it when people don t say nice things about him at all times. Of course, he can pay people to do that on his campaign team. Thus the revolving door of campaign managers. Yet, when it comes to the press, they re pretty much just going to report the words coming out of his mouth, and he really doesn t like that, because, well, he s an ass, and honest reporting highlights that fact.In yet another whiny tweet, Trump unloads on the media, but this time around his  source  for the media being unfair to him is, well, the media.He tweeted: It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact, that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history! It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact, that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2016So, let me get this perfectly clear: Trump is whining that the media is piling on against him, and his proof of that is   the media.Okay there, buddy. Way to fully contradict yourself. Sad!How in the hell does he think he can be president if he can t handle criticism?If only there were a tiny violin to play him a sad, sad song.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images; Twitter",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ann Coulter Admits: If Clinton Wins, Republicans Will Go Out Of Business","If there is one reason to vote for Hillary Clinton, it will be because of one thing: Republicans will become obsolete.At least that s what Ann Coulter thinks. The polemic, bigoted and hateful author, a firebrand in the conservative arena, gave us the best possible reason to choose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Should Clinton win, everyone on the Republican side from talk radio hosts, to Fox News, to future candidates, will be out of the game, and Democrats will reign supreme.Clinton contends that Clinton, if elected, will grant amnesty to 30, 40 million  illegal immigrants (even though the number may be lower than 11 million), and will quadruple the number of Muslim refugees coming into the country. Should that happen,  there will be no hope for any Republican ever winning another election.  Not only that, but Coulter predicted her future if Clinton becomes president: There s no point to what I do, what talk radio hosts do, what Fox News does. Nobody goes to the game when you can t win. For once, Coulter and I agree on something. There is no point to anything she or Fox News does. So forget the Supreme Court, forget income inequality, forget our standing in the world   there is now at least one reason why all Democrats, liberals, progressives and Independents alike should come together vote for Hillary Clinton come November: To put Ann Coulter out of business.The 10-time New York Times bestselling author has already gone on the record saying she will instead write cookbooks and crime novels if Trump loses.Some liberal writers and pundits would lose material with her gone, but for the greater good, the trade off isn t shabby.Coulter has been one of Trump s biggest supporters and surrogates, even going as far as writing a new book, completely dedicated to holding up the billionaire candidate as a god-like figure, called  In Trump We Must. Released just in the last few days, it s already a bestseller.Fellow Democrats, let s make this her last bestseller and finally rid ourselves of the cancer that is Ann Coulter and others.Get out and vote, and vote for Hillary Clinton.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Black Voter SCHOOLS Trump And Republican Party For Their Pathetic Outreach Effort,"If the Republican Party actually took this guy s advice they wouldn t be a party on the verge of extinction.Donald Trump and the GOP are waging a pathetic effort to reach out to black voters, but a black voter who writes a column for the Charlotte Observer took the Republican Party to task on Tuesday by teaching them a lesson on how they can attract minority voters if they are really serious about getting votes beyond the old white male demographic. Hey, Republican Party. African-American voter here,  Eric Frazier began.  I hear you ve been looking for me, but you re sending out such wildly mixed messages that I m not sure if I should be flattered or furious. Hat No. 2 fits me pretty snugly right now. Here s why.Your national standard-bearer, Donald Trump, is making an explicit appeal for my vote. He came to Charlotte last week and said the Democratic Party plays black voters for suckers while black neighborhoods rot. Trump asked African-Americans what they have to lose by voting for someone new, which Frazier called a  fair question. Too bad the guy asking it ranks as the most racially inflammatory presidential candidate since arch-segregationist George Wallace,  he snapped back.  Instead of making his black-voter sales pitch by talking to us, he s doing it by talking about us to white audiences. That tells me a hell of a lot more than the words on his Teleprompter do. Someone call the burn unit because Trump just got torched.Frazier called Trump out for calling all black people poor when, in fact, 74 percent of African-Americans live above the poverty line. Frazier concedes that a 26 percent poverty rate is still too high, especially when compared to white people, but the statistics clearly show that Trump was wrong to make such a claim. Frazier opined that Trump is only making a pitch to black voters because he is trying to just give  cover to embarrassed white supporters who are sick of answering for his racial provocations. He then pointed out that Republicans in North Carolina, where Trump made his pitch, are working hard to suppress black voters by cutting Sunday voting and early voting, both of which are popular among black communities.Frazier even gave Republicans a quick lesson on how they can truly convince black voters to vote for them. But they probably aren t going to like it. Blacks vote Democrat today because Democrats fought for their votes. The party that once welcomed cross-burning Klansmen did an about-face on civil rights and earned the black vote.Are you fighting to get those votes back? Nope.The path to do so is clear, if you re interested. Embrace affirmative action   and let racist base voters walk. Pass criminal justice reform. Champion black entrepreneurship and the rebuilding of the inner cities. Reach out to churchgoing black families; their traditionalist social values mirror yours.Even viewed through the lens of small-government conservatism, this agenda is do-able.You ll lose old voters. And you ll gain new ones. Just as the Democrats did 50 years ago.In a changing America, you ll be in position to compete for real minority votes, instead of just complaining about imaginary fraudulent ones. To conclude, Frazier told Republicans to stop thinking black people are stupid and to start treating them like a serious voting block who damn well know who and what policies they are voting for. Concerned about black votes this November, GOP?  Frazier asked.  Quit whining. Stop provoking. Start competing. The question is will Republicans take this advice seriously or will they ignore it like they usually do? Because the white conservative base Republicans have been relying on for years is dying off and there are not enough young conservatives to replace them.Winning national elections no longer comes down to who wins the white vote. Donald Trump is seriously courting the old white male demographic, but his alienation of young people, blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, and women have seriously crippled his campaign. It has also crippled the Republican Party down the ticket and could have serious repercussions for the GOP for many years to come.If Republicans ever want to sit in the White House again, they are going to have to kick out the racists and get back to being the Party of Lincoln. Because right now, Lincoln is spinning in his grave due to the fact that white supremacists have taken over the party and are bragging about it.Black voters definitely do NOT want to support a political party that is infested and controlled by people who hate them. And pretending that black voters will do exactly that is insulting and is a big reason why Republicans can count on losing the black vote for decades to come if they continue to refuse to change.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Calls On White Supporters To Intimidate Voters At The Polls,"Earlier this month, the Trump campaign posted on its website an advertisement seeking election observers to monitor locations. The move, which is unusual for private campaigns, comes from the irrational fear that should Hillary Clinton win, the election would be rigged. So Trump s solution? Have his rabid, conspiracy theory believing supporters intimidate voters in poll lines.In Pennsylvania, where polls have Clinton ahead by as much as nine points, Trump claims the only way Clinton could win is if she cheats or those in the Democratic Party  rig  the election in her favor. So his initial call was to have his supporters monitor the stations in the predominantly black and minority -voting urban areas of the state.It was very reminiscent of the 1960s Jim Crow intimidation of the South.After facing some backlash for the dangerous and archaic call to suppress and intimidate voters, Trump doubled down on his claim that the election will be rigged and that supporters should  watch  the polling locations very closely on election day:You ve got to get every one of your friends. You ve got to get every one of your family. You ve got to get everybody to go out and watch. And go out and vote. And when I say watch, you know what I m talking about, right? You know what I m taking about. I think you got to go out and you got to watch.The question is just what should his people be watching for? Should they be watching and  observing  people of color? Should they be monitoring young, college-aged millenials? Should they be asking voters their personal information so they can play Sherlock Holmes?Once again, Trump sounds his dog whistle. When he tells his predominantly white audience,  you know what I m talking about,  the innuendo could not be more clear: watch, intimidate and disenfranchise minority voters.Of course, Republicans, who have been pushing the now widely debunked myth of rampant voter fraud, will be mum on this. In justification, they will point to the said myth that is rampant voter fraud as why they support this dangerous, racist and damaging call to action.Trump s call to intimidate voters should be a warning to all Americans: don t get complacent. Get out, vote, and take this monstrosity down.Featured image via Angelo Meredino/Getty Images",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Hillary CRUSHES Trump On Kimmel, Will Draw On Elementary School Experience To Debate Him","Hillary Clinton appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night and absolutely killed it.Jimmy Kimmel has spent a lot of time on his show mocking Donald Trump, so it was only natural for him to talk to the Democratic nominee about him.The first segment of the interview was dedicated entirely to discussing the imploding Republican nominee.Right after Hillary sat down Kimmel remarked that the crowd was cheering quite enthusiastically for the  co-founder of ISIS,  which drew laughter from the former Secretary of State, who replied that the claim was one of the crazier things that Trump has said during his campaign.And with all the ridiculous things Trump has said on the campaign trail, Kimmel asked if she gets upset. I don t get upset anymore,  Clinton said,  because I d be upset all the time. Hillary pointed out that Trump s rhetoric is music to the terrorists  ears because they would love to influence our elections in any way they can. It also gives them advertising material to use to draw new recruits.Considering Trump s unpredictability and insanity throughout his run for the presidency, Kimmel wondered how Hillary is preparing to debate him, which drew a very interesting and hilarious response. I watched a lot of his debates during the primaries and he insulted all of his opponents, he insulted all the moderators, he insulted, I guess about 80 percent of the American people and the rest of the world  You gotta be prepared for all the wacky stuff that comes at you. I am drawing on my experience in elementary school. Kimmel also asked Hillary about her health and the claims of Trump and his team that she is unfit to serve because she is not well. Hillary compared Trump s attack to a tabloid story, remarking that the National Enquirer once said she would be dead in six months, but that was a long time ago and she s still full of life. I don t know why they are saying this,  Clinton said.  I think on the one hand, it s part of the wacky strategy. Just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you. On the other hand, it just absolutely makes no sense. I don t go around questioning Donald Trump s health. Kimmel then challenged her to open a pickle jar to prove her fitness, and she opened it.Hillary then admitted that she had hoped to be running against someone more serious and qualified to do the job of President of the United States. I would prefer to be running against somebody who I thought was qualified to be president and temperamentally fit to be commander-in-chief I don t think we ve ever been confronted with somebody who we see right now in the midst of this election is unqualified and temperamentally unfit. Hillary went on to name three Republicans who have endorsed her and praised their decision to put country first.And at the end of the interview, she read some mean quotes uttered by Donald Trump. But she refused to read the one of Trump saying he would date his own daughter.This was an excellent interview for Hillary Clinton. She dispelled the rampant falsehoods being pushed by Trump and his minions while at the same time showing the American people that she is a positive person who is qualified for the office she seeks. Now it s just a matter of waiting for the thin-skinned Trump to throw a hissy fit about on Twitter.Featured image via Screenshot",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Is Collapsing Like A House Of Cards As Andrea Tantaros Names Bill O’Reilly In Lawsuit,"The women of Fox News are sick and tired of putting up with the sexist bullshit of their male colleagues and bosses.After Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Roger Ailes it became clear that sexism and misogyny ran deeper within the company than anyone realized. As it turns out, it went way beyond on-air comments made by male anchors like Bill O Reilly.Once Megyn Kelly backed Carlson up, Ailes was up a creek without a paddle and was soon ousted from his position. The scandal rocked the conservative network as former female reporters came forward to tell their own stories of non-stop harassment that turned the workplace into a personal hell.And now Carlson is not the only one filing a lawsuit. Andrea Tantaros has as well.Tantaros filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court on Monday hammering the network for punishing her when she went to the top brass to complain about Ailes sexually harassing her. Fox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny,  her lawsuit says according to the New York Times. As it turns out, Tantaros also named Bill O Reilly in the lawsuit for making unwanted advances toward her.Fox executives attempted to pay Tantaros off if she renounced her claims but she told them to go f*ck themselves.The lawsuit details how Roger Ailes treated her, including being barred from wearing pants on set because Ailes wanted to see her legs and he often asked her to turn around in his office so her could ogle her. She refused and was punished as a result by being yanked off  The Five  and placed on  Outnumbered,  which is a lower rated show.Tantaros attempted to seek help within the company from Bill Shine, who was recently named co-president of the network after Ailes departed but he told her to  let this one go  because Ailes is too powerful. Ailes did not act alone,  the lawsuit continues.  He may have been the primary culprit, but his actions were condoned by his most senior lieutenants, who engaged in a concerted effort to silence Tantaros by threats, humiliation and retaliation. In short, Bill O Reilly and Bill Shine have been named alongside Ailes. And even Steve Doocy was named in Carlson s lawsuit. These are some huge names at Fox News, which means the network that preached family values while spitting on women for years in front of the camera are now getting outed for being pricks toward their own female colleagues behind the camera as well.One has to wonder how many more women will come forward and how long Fox News can survive if more of their big stars fall in utter disgrace.While I disagree with Tantaros politically, no woman should have to deal with discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. But it sounds like the men of Fox News treated their workplace like a frat house and treated women like objects meant to be demeaned and disrespected.Fox News is starting to fall apart like a house of cards, but let s be honest, it was only a matter of time.Featured image via Dangerous Minds",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SCAMPAIGN: Here’s How GOP Donors Are Making Trump Rich (But They Don’t Know That),"Donald Trump is making a lot of money thanks to the donors giving money to his presidential campaign, and it s all legal. Even though Trump s actual wealth is still a secret thanks to his refusal to release his tax returns, he is required by law to submit annual spending reports on the behalf of his campaign to the Federal Elections Commission.The latest filing from the Trump campaign shows a new way that Trump has found to make money, and it comes directly from those who believe he should be president and are giving them his money.Trump nearly quintupled the monthly rent his presidential campaign pays for its headquarters at Trump Tower to $169,758 in July, when he was raising funds from donors, compared with March, when he was self-funding his campaign, according to a Huffington Post review of Federal Election Commission filings. The rent jumped even though he was paying fewer staff in July than he did in March.The Trump campaign paid Trump Tower Commercial LLC $35,458 in March   the same amount it had been paying since last summer   and had 197 paid employees and consultants. In July, it paid 172 employees and consultants.The filing is the latest piece in the ongoing mystery that has bedeviled campaign observers. Trump is bringing in millions of dollars, but so far has barely spent any money on advertising or basic campaign infrastructure like field offices in key swing states. Instead, as this filing shows, Trump has funneled a lot of the campaign dollars right into his own pockets by using Trump businesses as vendors to the campaign.What ends up happening is that the array of Trump businesses ends up sucking up all the money that donors think is going to a political campaign.Like his other businesses that went belly-up   Trump Steaks, Trump Water, Trump University, the Trump Taj Mahal and various other real estate projects   Trump profits while the investors (and now donors) are hung out to dry.Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Founder Of Bush Institute Endorses Hillary Clinton – Even He’s With Her Now,"Former President George W. Bush s Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy joined the ranks of an ever-growing list of Republicans who find themselves backing the Democratic nominee when he announced on Monday that he is endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.Speaking with MSNBC on Monday night, James Glassman, who also happens to be the founding director of the George W. Bush Institute at the former president s library in Dallas, officially announced he was backing Clinton and hailed her as by far the superior candidate. She has the experience. She s got the character. She has the values,  Glassman said.  She is the kind of candidate I support and that, as I say, millions of republicans are supporting. Glassman may be the highest ranking Republican to decide that he would have to be batshit crazy to support Donald Trump, but he is far from alone. He joins a growing number of other Bush administration officials who have endorsed Clinton and denounced Trump s bid for the presidency. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, former aide to President Bush Lezlee Westine, and former Bush State Dept. and NSC official Kori Schake have all said that they are backing Clinton over Trump.Sally Bradshaw, who managed two campaigns for Jeb Bush when he was running for governor, has said that because she lives in a swing state, she will cast her vote for Clinton if the race in Florida is close in November. Other former Bush officials, including former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, have strongly criticized the GOP nominee but have stopped just short of officially announcing their support for Clinton over Trump.Republican Rep. Richard Hanna, who decided a while ago that he would retire when his term is up, is currently the only elected Republican to officially declare that he is endorsing Clinton. However, there are many prominent conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill who have said that they refuse to vote for Trump even though they have not officially come out in support of Clinton.Featured image via YouTube",News,"August 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch John Oliver Speak Directly To Donald Trump To Ask A VERY Important Question (VIDEO),"If there s anyone who is absolutely tired of Donald Trump s shenanigans running for office, it s Last Week Tonight host John Oliver.On Sunday s show he had a simple request of Trump: Drop out. Simply drop out and tell America this entire candidacy was a stunt. A satire designed to expose the flaws in the system. He also added: You re either going to win, or you re going to lose, and I think both those scenarios end pretty badly for you. Oliver then went on to explain that if Trump were to win that he would absolutely unqualified and his candidacy is very reminiscent of a fiction book that is about a class clown who ran for president as a joke.Speaking directly to Trump, he also says: Although your campaign was the political equivalent of a bigoted clown s blazing funeral pyre, you have accidentally made upwards of four good points during this campaign. Adding: If you dropped out in order to teach America a lesson, you would not be a loser, you would be a legend. It would actually be something quite extraordinary if Trump were to just drop out, because it would absolutely expose how flawed not only our system is, but also how flawed many of the citizens are living within it.Oliver wants Trump to admit that it s all been a joke, and to come on his show, but under one condition, he must read the speech from the book  The Kid Who Ran For President. That speech reads: I have a question for the grown-ups of America  Are you out of your minds? Are you expecting me to enforce the Constitution? I never even read it. I was absent from school that day. You want me as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces? What if somebody attacks the United States? Would you really want me in charge? America must be in really bad shape if you elected me president. You better get it together and find some qualified people to run this country or we ll all be in big trouble. It s a speech that one could quite literally imagine Trump saying.Now it s up to Trump to own up to pulling a fast one over on the United States and appear on Oliver s show, OR continue on being the schmuck that he may truly be. It s really up to him.Watch the segment here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDqDKfBvirQFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"August 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Campaign Manager Got Asked About His Tax Returns And It Was A DISASTER (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s new campaign manager is just a few days into her role, but already Kellyanne Conway is having difficulty defending her presidential candidate   and is basically showing us that she is just as much of a flip-flopper as Trump.Trump s refusal to release his tax returns has become a massive talking point against him at this point of the election, with people from both parties asking him to be transparent. On Sunday night, Conway went on CNN to tell Americans that Trump would be releasing his tax returns after they were done being audited. But just seconds later, Conway seemed to contradict that statement and say that the campaign had no plans to release tax returns that were not being audited.CNN host Dana Bash had cornered Conway at the beginning of the interview, calling her out by stating that before she became Trump s campaign manager, she had been an advocate for releasing the tax returns. According to Conway, however, this all changed when she accepted her new role. Conway said: So, now that I am on the inside, I know something I didn t know then, which is, he is under audit and what that means. And he has said very clearly   and I back him up completely   that when the audit is completed, he will release the tax returns. Bash reminded Conway that not all of Trump s tax returns were being audited by the IRS   some were finished. Bash asked, You mentioned the audit. According to his lawyers, the years 2002 to 2008 are no longer under audit. So, would you release those tax returns? Conway backtracked and said,  No, I would not,  and then rushed to change topics and blame Obama for something   just like her boss. She said: And this entire tax return debate is somewhat confounding to me, in the following sense. I don t think that it creates one job, gets one more individual who does not have health insurance covered by health insurance, particularly under the disaster that has been Obamacare with these private insurers pulling out our exchanges now and reporting billions of dollars of losses. What I think happened   I think people are most concerned about is, how would a President Trump or how would a President Hillary affect their tax bill? Everyday life is becoming increasingly unaffordable for Americans, and they deserve the kind of relief that he laid very strongly out in his speech. Ironically, Conway then talked about transparency: If we want transparency, if we want specifics, the most relevant thing that people can look at is, what is his plan for their tax bill to make everyday affordability, job security and rebuilding the American economy.

 Florida Republican Has An INSANE Meltdown After Being Called Out In Interview: ‘Go F*** Yourself!’ (VIDEO),"Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent, is trying to run for Congress again, but he might have a hard time if word of his insane temper gets out.Bongino had lost a Maryland Senate election four years ago and a congressional election in the same state two years after that, but Bongino refused to give up. This time, the GOPer is trying to get elected in Florida s 19th district   which he doesn t even live in. In fact, Bongino s residence is actually on the opposite side of Florida. This strange strategy came into question in an interview with Politico reporter Marc Caputo, and quickly went downhill as Caputo tried to ask the innocent question of just why Bongino would be running for Congress in a district that is nowhere near his home. Bongino did what basically any Republican does when they re exposed and called out   he had an epic, profanity-laced meltdown.Caputo inquired, So why are you running for office in a city you don t live in, in a county you don t live in, in a district you don t live in? Bongino tried to dance around the question, but Caputo eventually got Bongino to confess that he wasn t a registered voter in the district. So Caputo did what any reporter is supposed to do   call him out: So let s see: You move down to Florida after losing two campaigns in Maryland; you say you re going to stay in Maryland and fight; you tuck tail and run away to Florida; you go look to run in District 18, you see you re not going to be able to win there; you try to run in District 19, you re losing there. You re like a professional political candidate who loses. For Bongino, the truth was just too much. The GOP candidate lost all self-control and unleashed a temper tantrum that might have made Donald Trump a little bit jealous. Some of it went like this: You re a disgusting real piece of sh*t. Go f*ck yourself, you piece of sh*t! You don t know why I moved to Florida, motherf*cker! You shut your mouth, you f*cking coward! The interview ended with Bongino hanging up on Caputo, who was stunned but amused.

 JUST IN: Trump Wants To Bring Reality Television To The White House (AUDIO),"It would appear Donald Trump not only wants to become President of the United States, but he wants to make a lot of money off of it as well, because of course he does.While speaking on the podcast  The Takeaway, Vanity Fair contributing editor Sarah Ellison revealed that Trump refers to the electorate as an  audience.  In fact, Ellison has been talking about this since June when it s been shown that Trump doesn t so much want to win the White House, but build a media empire, and grow an audience from his popularity in the election.According to Ellison s piece in Vanity Fair: Trump is indeed considering creating his own media business, built on the audience that has supported him thus far in his bid to become the next president of the United States. According to several people briefed on the discussions, the presumptive Republican nominee is examining the opportunity presented by the  audience  currently supporting him. Trump basically wants to create his own right-wing media empire. Ellison added: He has also discussed the possibility of launching a  mini-media conglomerate  outside of his existing TV-production business, Trump Productions LLC. He has, according to one of these people, enlisted the consultation of his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who owns the The New York Observer. Trump s rationale, according to this person, is that, win or lose, we are onto something here. We ve triggered a base of the population that hasn t had a voice in a long time.  For his part, Kushner was heard at a New York dinner party saying that  the people here don t understand what I m seeing. You go to these arenas and people go crazy for him.' And now, according to The Hill, Trump has been in talks with an NBC executive to continue on with The Apprentice from the White House if he were to win. [NBCUniversal Chief Executive Steve Burke and Trump] outlined, presumably fantastically, that Trump should run for president; and on the off chance that he won, he would continue to star in  The Apprentice  from within the White House,  Ellison wrote about a 2011 conversation between the two. I don t know about you, but the only job the President of the United States should be worried about is being the President of the United States. Add this to the reasons to make sure he doesn t win this November.Here s audio revealing Trump s intentions:Featured Photo by Sara D.

 Melania Trump BUSTED Committing Perjury – Lied About Having College Degree While Under Oath,"Melania Trump has proved over the past year that she is just as dishonest as her husband. Now it appears that she committed perjury by lying under oath about her nonexistent college degree.Shortly after she was busted plagiarizing her speech at the Republican National Convention, stealing an entire paragraph from Michelle Obama, it came to light that she was also full of sh*t when she claimed that she had graduated from the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia with a degree in architecture. In truth, Melania dropped out after her freshman year when she moved to the United States to pursue her modeling career, possibly under a visa that was less than legal. When the blatant lie surfaced, her website promptly pulled her bio.But now, it looks like she didn t just lie to the general public about having a degree, she also lied in court while testifying under oath, which happens to make her guilty of committing perjury.According to a report by Racked.com, the case involved her caviar skincare line, which never made it off the ground. The line was promoted on Good Morning America, her husband s show The Apprentice and on CNBC. But when all was said and done, the skin care products never became a reality. The contract for the line was trashed when Steve Hilbert, who was a personal friend, was fired from the cosmetic company she was working with, New Sunshine LLC.The situation eventually resulted in a lawsuit and Melania was asked to testify in court. She told the judge how angry and frustrated she was that she had worked so hard to promote the product line that the company ultimately never launched. And here s where it gets interesting.The attorney asked Melania various questions about her personal background and according to the transcripts, she was less than truthful. Where were you born, Mrs. Trump?  the attorney asked. I was born in Slovenia,  she answered.

 WATCH: Donald Trump Throws A Hissy Fit About Morning Joe And Gets Hilariously Buried,"Despite claiming that he never watches Morning Joe on MSNBC, it became very clear on Monday morning that Donald Trump lied about that.Political analyst Rick Tyler joined the panel and had a field day mocking the Republican nominee for finally toning down his campaign rhetoric instead of continuing to act like a petulant child. Reince Priebus has been particularly happy about the change and Tyler couldn t resist comparing him to a dad who had just successfully potty trained his toddler. He s sort of talking about his candidate as if he graduated from diapers to big boy pants,  Tyler quipped as the studio broke out in laughter.  This is not great progress,  he continued.  His new tone, I don t understand what the new tone is. Tyler went on to question whether Trump s new pivot is the real Donald Trump since he s only doing it late into the campaign after weeks of disastrous poll numbers.Mika Brzezinski chimed in later on that Trump s claim that Hillary Clinton would cause Americans to  lose everything  sounded like it came from someone who loaded up on alcohol prior to the rally. He belted like, honestly, like he s had a lot to drink,  Brzezinski said.  His delivery is very  Blaaaaaagh! Here s the video via Twitter..@rickwtyler: Reince Preibus sort of talked about Trump  as if he graduated from diapers to big boy pants  https://t.co/5NlRA9O5L7  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) August 22, 2016As it turns out, Donald Trump was watching Morning Joe while they were mocking him, so of course the thin-skinned businessman lashed out on Twitter by attacking Mika and threatened to reveal secrets about her and Joe Scarborough.

One of the reasons why Trump s campaign has been imploding is because he can t control his reactions towards those who mock or criticize him.

 WATCH: Mike Pence Laughs At His Own Running Mate When Asked About Pathetic Black Voter Outreach,"Donald Trump has his sights set on a voting bloc he has not a chance in hell of winning: black people. Despite Trump s blatant racism and other assorted forms of bigotry, he made the crazy claim that if elected, he d have 95% of the African American support by the time he runs for reelection in 2020. Of course all sane people know this to be false. It also seems that his own running mate thinks such an idea is pretty funny, too.Vice presidential candidate Mike Pence appeared on Fox News with host Ainsley Earhardt, and she asked him about The Donald s extraordinary statement. Pence, of course, tried to spin and cover up his chuckling, and actually pretended he believes Donald Trump cares about black people. Well, that s Donald Trump. He has a heart for every American and he also, he s a truth-teller. He speaks the truth. It s been the failed policies of Democrat politicians that have, that have harmed people living in the cities in this country now for generations. And it s had special impact on the African-American community.And his optimistic view about 2020 when he s running for reelection, that s pure Donald Trump. He s speaking the truth but s also doing what a leader should do. As President John F. Kennedy] said,  We re going to advance policies that cause all ships to rise, to create new opportunities for every American. Haha, good one, Governor Pence. You know good and damn well that Donald Trump doesn t care about anyone but Donald Trump, and his lengthy and well documented history of racism shows that he especially doesn t care about black people. You might be fooling yourself here, but you re sure as hell not fooling us.Watch the exchange below, via The Hill: Why are you laughing?

 Donald Trump Colorado Campaign Office Is Literally Run By A Kid (VIDEO),"The Donald Trump campaign is relying heavily on a 12 year old to help open a field office in one of the most important counties in the swing state of Colorado. You read that right. A 12-year-old is being relied upon to ensure that the thin-skinned man-baby candidate obtains keys to the White House.Weston Imer is co-chair of the campaign in Jefferson County, but his mother, the official field coordinator, said that she gave her son the bulk of the work in order to help teach him responsibility.Weston sits in the office instructing volunteers on what to do, as well as making phone calls to Trump supporters. Get involved   kids need to be educated,  Weston said, according to KDVR. Parents have the responsibility to educate their kids,  Laurel Imer said.Weston will be at the field office every day until he has to start school in September. At the tender age of 12-years-old, Weston is likely in the 7th grade. Do you want to be President of the United States one day?  a reporter asked Weston. Definitely, 2040 watch for me and Baron Trump if you re watching. I ll take ya as my running mate,  Imer said.Watch:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn9Zx8yUkXY]The 12-year-old would like to become President of the free world one day. We re pretty sure that Donald, his idol, never dreamed he would get this close to the White House since he s done everything possible to discourage that.Donald trails Hillary Clinton by ten points in Colorado, according to a Fox News poll. Again, we re talking about a Fox News poll. It s not exactly surprising since Donald s campaign doled out $7.7 million to his family and Trump-owned companies. Instead of increasing spending on staff or organizing   like in crucial states such as Colorado   the campaign spent $1.8 million on hats and other merchandise.It s commendable that Mrs. Imer wants to teach her child responsibility but this is a presidential election in important battleground territory. Aside from that, educating her child while using Donald as a model for responsibility is counterproductive. Donald is a scam artist, nothing more.Image via screen capture.

 Washed-Up Actress Kirstie Alley Whines About Obama’s Flood Response In Pathetic Tweets,"Kirstie Alley hasn t been relevant in the world of acting in many years. Usually, the only way she can get any news attention is by either appearing on the cover of The National Enquirer or by making outrageous statements   which is just what she did on this weekend when she tweeted out complaints regarding President Obama s response to the flooding situation in Louisiana.Everyone is well aware that the people of Louisiana are hurting due to a massive amount of flooding that swept the state. However, due to the fact that the President or any presidential candidates visiting the area would be nothing but a distraction and a drain on resources, the Governor of Louisiana has asked the president and the presidential candidates to not go to the state until things are more controlled. This information somehow missed Kirstie Alley, who, of course, supports Donald Trump for president. It s no wonder she supports him; after all it seems that her tweeting style is just like his   ignorant and self-congratulatory to the extreme.Or on a golf course in Martha's Vineyard instead of in Louisiana? pic.twitter.com/YJukzqW8bz  Kirstie Alley (@kirstiealley) August 19, 2016My point is..Do u think USA wants to C him playing golf while Louisiana is 20 feet under water & people R dying? https://t.co/jNJldU4eLU  Kirstie Alley (@kirstiealley) August 19, 2016I thought Bush waited too long also!

 WATCH: White Lives Matter Group Carries Assault Rifles Outside Houston NAACP Building (VIDEO),"A group of  White Lives Matter  protestors held a protest outside of the building of the Houston chapter of the NAACP on Sunday morning. Members of the group indicated that they were angry that the NAACP has not spoken out against the Black Lives Matter movement. We came out here to protest against the NAACP and their failure in speaking out against the atrocities that organizations like Black Lives Matter and other pro-black organizations have caused the attack and killing of white police officers, the burning down of cities and things of that nature,  a member of the White Lives Matter group said.  If they re going to be a civil rights organization and defend their people, they also need to hold their people accountable. During the protest, protestors carried assault rifles and other firearms, as well as a giant Confederate flag. We re not out here to instigate or start any problems,  Reed said.  Obviously we re exercising our Second Amendment rights but that s because we have to defend ourselves. Their organizations and their people are shooting people based on the color of their skin. We re not. We definitely will defend ourselves, but we re not out here to start any problems. We came here because the NAACP headquarters is here and that s one of the most racist groups in America,  a protestor named Scott Lacey said.Police eventually arrived at the protest and created a barricade.

 WATCH: Rudy Giuliani Begs People To Search For Clinton Conspiracy Videos,"On Sunday, Rudy Giuliani appeared on Fox News Sunday, where he decided to push the right-wing conspiracy theory that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is suffering from severe health problems. The right-wing myth was pushed heavily by Fox News  Sean Hannity.Despite the fact that the conspiracy was debunked almost immediately, Giuliani insisted that Clinton is in fact at death s door with some kind of illness. He alleged that there is vast media conspiracy out to silence those who want to expose the truth about Clinton s health. She doesn t need to campaign. She has The New York Times, she has the [New York] Daily News, she has ABC, she has CBS, she has NBC. She has an entire media empire that constantly demonizes Donald Trump and fails to point out that she hasn t had a press conference in 300 days, 200 days, 100 days, I don t know how long,  Giuliani said.  Fails to point out several signs of illness by her. All you got to do is go online. All you have to do  The show s host Shannon Bream interrupted Giuliani to say: Which her campaign and a number of people defending her saying there s nothing factual to the claims about her health, and that that s speculation at best. Here s where Giuliani really goes off the rails. He asks for viewers to look up videos from Clinton health truthers, rather than listen to what is reported on in the news. Go online and put down Hillary Clinton illness and take a look at the videos for yourself,  Giuliani insisted.You can watch the segment from the broadcast below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"August 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Newest Foreign Policy Advisor Is One Of The Dumbest People To Ever Serve In Congress,"If you weren t having nightmares before about Donald Trump potentially having the nuclear codes, his latest choice for national security advisor should keep you up for months, or at least until November 9th. He has chosen, as a national security advisor, a woman who believes the earth is six million years old and that the world is ending very, very soon anyway. That woman is the former Congresswoman from Minnesota, Michele Bachmann.The campaign hasn t yet confirmed that Bachmann is advising on matters of foreign policy, but she is advising him on evangelical matters and she was, in a bit of tragic irony, part of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence when she was still in Congress. To some who have no idea about anything outside the borders of our country (Donald Trump), it would be logical to believe that she s an expert on foreign policy. She s not.As for her reputed position as a foreign policy advisor on Trump s team, Bachmann says this:The former Minnesota congresswoman attended a fundraiser in the state for Trump on Saturday, where she revealed to the press that she has his ear on foreign policy. He also recognizes there is a threat around the world, not just here in Minnesota, of radical Islam,  she said, according to MPR News.  I wish our President Obama also understood the threat of radical Islam and took it seriously. He s a common-sense guy, not into political correctness,  Bachmann added, according to the Star Tribune.Source: The HillLet s forget for a moment that Bachmann is a disaster on social issues. She hates gay people. She thinks the Founding Fathers outlawed slavery. She is anti-science. She s an anti-government conspiracy theorist. She thinks half of all African-American pregnancies end in abortion. She thinks that there would be no unemployment if there were no minimum wage. She thinks the U.S. is running out of rich people.As for her foreign expertise, she believes that the United States wants some sort of global currency. She believes Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. That would be Tel Aviv. She believes Sharia Law is around every corner. More significantly, she believes that there s no point in making the world a better place because Jesus will come vacuum everyone up to Heaven within the very near future. We know that there is more prophecy of Jesus  second coming even than there was in the first,  she said.  We also should be encouraged and empowered as believers in Jesus Christ   now more than ever   with the Bible in one hand, the newspaper in another, to say to our neighbors and co-workers and people at church, this is about the Lord speaking to the world that,  I am coming soon.

 WATCH: Reliable Sources Explains ‘Trumpbart’ And How It Will Shape The Election (VIDEO),"Steve Bannon, Donald Trump s new campaign CEO, is the former chairman of the radical alt-right media company Breitbart. On Sunday, Reliable Sources host Brian Stelter and former Breitbart spokesman Kurt Bardella explained that the site is the  de facto SuperPAC of Donald Trump.  The two, along with former NPR CEO, Ken Stern explained the significance of the merger.Stelter begins the segment by describing the political merger as  Trumpbart. We could call it a political merger,  Trumpbart.  This week, GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway became the new face of Donald Trump s campaign, appearing all across TV. But it s Steve Bannon who may be the new inner voice of the campaign. Until Tuesday, he was the executive chairman of the far-right website Breitbart. On Wednesday, he became the Trump campaign s CEO. Stelter asks Bardell to describe Breitbart to people who may not be familiar with the media site. Bardell responds, saying: I think you look at it as the de facto SuperPAC of Donald Trump. And really for the last year, year and a half in the Republican primary, they have been the rapid response arm of the Trump campaign. Anytime anything,  Bardell says before being interrupted by Stelter. Rapid response arm of the Trump campaign? Let s underscore that You re saying it s even, what, further to the right than Fox News? Oh my gosh, it s not even a   they make Fox News look like MSNBC,  Bardella clarifies.  I think that any time that there was a controversy, something that Trump may have said that was generating headlines, Breitbart was the first destination that you could go to to see in real time what the Trump line of thinking was. It was the most sympathetic voice for Trump, and anytime that anyone in the mainstream media would in any way, characterize, or attack, or question Trump s tactics, they were the place that you could go to for that sympathetic ear for Trump. This merger comes at an odd time for the Trump campaign it might end up being Breitbart that benefits from the merger. Trump has already tried and failed to pivot to the center multiple times on his most controversial positions. Having Bannon on board his campaign is only going to make that task that much more difficult. Breitbart, on the other hand, has a spokesman who they can use to make whatever reactionary conspiracy they might have go mainstream.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot ",News,"August 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Louisiana Governor Slams Giuliani For Criticizing His Response To Trump Visit,"Rudy Giuliani threw a hissy fit over Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards  reaction to Donald Trump visiting the flood damage in his state, and Edwards called him out for it.On Friday, the former New York mayor who now forgets about 9/11 posted a statement on Twitter whining about Bel Edwards asking the Republican nominee to do something to help the victims of the flooding instead of just showing up to do a photo-op.Instead of following Gov. Bel Edwards s advice, Trump proceeded to get that photo-op, which consisted of him handing out play-doh instead of real supplies such as food and water.But Giuliani criticized Bel Edwards for making such a request and said that reaction towards President Obama is not the same negative reaction President Bush received after Hurricane Katrina.Giuliani said that Trump showed  true leadership  by going to the flood ravaged state and then plugged his book in the same breath.Then he bragged about being the mayor of NYC during the September 11th attacks.Here s the full post via Twitter.Giuliani statement on Louisiana s governor criticizing Trump trip:  During the September 11 attacks, I welcomed  pic.twitter.com/wFDRW5qhyi  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) August 19, 2016On Sunday, Bel Edwards fired back by telling CNN s Dana Bash that there is not a double standard here. I believe Mayor Giuliani got it completely wrong. I have not been critical of Mr. Trump s visit. I have tried not to comment because I don t want to get tied up in the politics of whether it s the president, whether it s Hillary Clinton or whether it s Donald Trump. I have tried not to comment. And the comments that I have made have been very reserved. So I think he was off base there with that comment. So I think he was off base there with that comment. Bel Edwards went on to point out that the reason President Obama has not visited Baton Rouge yet is because he asked him to come next week instead.Here s the video via CNN.But Edwards explained why President Obama was right not to visit yet during an interview with Rachel Maddow on Thursday. It is a major ordeal, they free up the interstate for him. We have to take hundreds of local first responders, police officers, sheriffs, deputies and state troopers to provide security for that type of visit. I would just as soon have those people engaged in the response rather than trying to secure the president. So I d ask him to wait, if he would, another couple weeks. So President Obama s presence would have been a major distraction and would have kept first responders from doing their jobs to help those in need.But that doesn t mean President Obama has done nothing like Republicans would have us believe. Gov. Edwards said on that point: I do want you to know, and your viewers to know, that within hours of me making a request for a federal declaration I got it from the president. He called me. I want you to know that I ve been speaking to Valerie Jarrett just about every day. He dispatched the FEMA administrator to meet with me for an entire day. Today I had the Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. We ve also had the four-star general who runs all of the guard for the country here today. And that s in addition to FEMA workers who have been embedded in the state in preparation for the relief effort.President Bush was not so much criticized for not visiting as much as he was criticized for not being prepared and not doing enough to help the victims in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, a storm that took the lives of nearly 2,000 people. FEMA was completely disorganized under Bush s watch. But President Obama has been on top of this latest disaster in Louisiana since the beginning.So Giuliani is out of line for criticizing President Obama. And he is out of line for criticizing Bel Edwards for making a reasonable request of Trump. Louisiana needs help, not photo-ops. Trump visited a Republican dominated area to make it look like he was universally welcomed in the state when it is clear that he wasn t. President Obama s presence would have only hindered the rescue and recovery effort. And you know Republicans would have whined about that if he had visited.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GOP Senator Compares Obama To ‘Drug Dealer’,"A Republican senator has compared President Obama to a  drug dealer  in controversial remarks just coming to light.The Senator in question is Illinois  Mark Kirk, who is in a tight fight for re-election this year. Kirk s comments came as part of ongoing criticism of the Obama administration s actions to stop Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. We can t have the president of the United States acting like the drug dealer in chief,  Kirk said.  Giving clean packs of money to a   state sponsor of terror. Those 500-euro notes will pop up across the Middle East.  . We re going to see problems in multiple (countries) because of that money given to them. Kirk was responding to reports that the administration paid $400 million in cash to Iran in January as Iran released Americans that had been held as prisoners. The money was part of a previously announced settlement in a case stemming from money owed since 1979, but the timing had not been known until this month.The State Department has debunked conservative conspiracies about the money given to Iran, pointing out that the money was Iran s own and frozen as a result of sanctions that were previously put in place. Releasing them was part of the negotiation process for the Iran deal. Republicans have falsely claimed that the money was a  ransom  paid to the Islamic nation.Kirk s harsh comments and their racially charged context comes at an unusual time for the senator. He has distanced himself from the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, as his opponent Rep. Tammy Duckworth leads him by 7% in the most recent poll.Illinois is a heavily Democratic state and is of course the home state of President Obama. Hillary Clinton is expected to easily win there this fall, and the already endangered Kirk may further injure his campaign with these new allegations.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 KKK Leader Brags That White Supremacists Have Taken Over The Republican Party (AUDIO),"White supremacists are celebrating Donald Trump s rise to the top of the Republican Party and KKK leader David Duke bragged about it on the radio.Speaking with Don Advo this week about Trump s decision to hire Breitbart boss Stephen K. Bannon to be his campaign CEO, Duke, who is a racist former KKK Grand Wizard, roared his approval of the choice as both Advo and Duke cheered that white supremacists had taken over the GOP, although he lamented that there were still  boll weevils in the cotton.  You know, because cotton is white and boll weevils are black or brown insects. So, something astonishing has happened. We appear to have taken over the Republican Party,  Advo declared to the delight of his Stormfront fans. Well, rank and file, but a lot of those boll weevils are still in those cotton balls, and, uh, the Republican Party may be a European-American populated party, but like a ball of cotton, you can have boll weevils in there that are going to rot it out from the inside,  Duke replied.Here s the audio via Daily Motion. duke alt right by DailyPoliticsDuke has been emboldened so much by Trump s successful seizure of the Republican Party crown that he is now running for the US Senate in Louisiana.Should he win, Republicans would have a unapologetic racist as part of their Senate caucus and would be a strong ally of Donald Trump should he win the presidency. A racist in the White House and a racist in the Senate is probably not exactly what Republicans were planning but that s what they got. And that s because Republicans created the atmosphere that allowed racists like Trump and Duke to rise.White supremacists love Donald Trump, and Duke has supported the Republican nominee throughout his campaign run.Not only does Trump and Duke need to be defeated, the Republican Party needs to be taken back from the racists who took it over. Because right now, Abraham Lincoln is spinning in his grave about what the GOP has become. The party that ended slavery and fought for civil rights has now become the party of white hoods.Featured image via Houston Chronicle",News,"August 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: CNN Host Makes Trump’s Campaign Manager Regret She Took The Job,"We re just days into experiencing the leadership skills Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump s new campaign manager, has to offer, and so far it s a disaster. An interview on CNN s State of the Union gave us a taste of Conway s ability to handle a little bit of grilling from the press.Before her rise to the top, Conway had called out Trump for his refusal to release his tax returns. Dana Bash, the show s host, wasted no time bringing up the matter during the interview. OK, now you re in charge of Donald Trump s campaign. Given that, given how you feel, are we going to see Donald Trump s tax returns soon? Conway, who is apparently not interested in creating any original talking points, went straight to the  there s a media conspiracy against Trump  line. Conway insisted that CNN should be more concerned with covering corruption relating to the Clinton Foundation.  Which, seeing as there is no real conspiracy against Trump, they did. Conway said: So, now that I m on the inside, I know something I didn t know then, which is he is under audit and what that means. And, he has said very clearly, and I back him up completely, that when the audit is completed he will release the tax returns. And let me just say something about transparency. It comes in many different forms, Dana, as does accountability and as does truthfulness. And we can t imagine going up against a less transparent, less accountable, more sort of rigged and corrupt individual as our political opponent than Hillary Clinton. She s had a terrible week when it comes to being transparent and accountable. Whether it s the revelations of the pay-for-play at the   in the State Department, that I know that CNN is very much on top of and your reporting is, Dana. As well as, as well as, the   what happened at the Clinton Foundation, which is a big hot mess. Bash responds saying: And we are talking about that for sure, but in this particular interview and these questions are about Donald Trump. And you mentioned the audit. According to his lawyers, the years 2002 to 2008 are no longer under audit. So would you release those tax returns? Conway continues to evade the question, saying: No, I would not. And this entire tax return debate is somewhat confounding to me in the following sense. I don t think that it creates one job, gets one more individual who does not have health insurance covered by health insurance, particularly under the disaster that has been Obamacare with these private insurers pulling out of our exchanges now and reporting billions of dollars of losses. What I think people are most concerned about is; how would a President Trump, or how would a President Hillary, affect their tax bill? Conway just proved that she is going to offer more of the same from the Trump campaign as we saw under the Manafort era. Same messaging and words, just a new mouth saying them.You can watch the exchange below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApplceC4RtUFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"August 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Black Trump Adviser: Staff Doesn’t Care About Reaching Out To Black Voters,"It s no secret that Team Trump has a problem with minorities   and that is putting it kindly. Despite Trump s recent attempts to fake caring about black people by speaking to black voters in a mostly white Wisconsin suburb, it couldn t be more clear that it s all just an attempt to save face. Well, now, one black Trump adviser has actually admitted what we already knew: the Trump camp couldn t give two shits about minority outreach.Sean Jackson leads the Black Republican Caucus of Florida, and somehow he thinks that Trump actually likes black people. Jackson actually blames Trump s campaign staff rather than the Great Orange Racist himself for the abysmal polling results when it comes to African American voters. Jackson says: Mr. Trump really does have a sincere, passionate interest in black outreach, but his campaign staff has dropped the ball. I have been saying repeatedly that you cannot go into a black community in the ninth hour of a campaign and ask them to vote for a GOP candidate. The party has done a piss-poor job of courting the black vote over 50 years. So you have to have more vested interest in time and in your financial effort for the whole campaign, not just in the last 100 days. Well, Mr. Jackson, you got one thing right here: The GOP HAS done a piss poor job of reaching out to black voters for decades. There s a reason for that, though: the party is full of racists. That s just the truth, but being a black Republican yourself, I suppose that you either refuse to see or choose to overlook that fact. Just a couple of examples, to remind you. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise is the number three ranking Republican in the House of Representatives. He also once bragged to a reporter that he is, quote,  David Duke without the baggage. Then you have Rep. Steve King, who literally floated white supremacist theories on live television during convention coverage. And that s just TWO examples. We won t even get started on just how racist The Donald himself is.Wake up, man   Donald Trump and the GOP don t give a damn about black people. They just want our votes, and you ve fallen for their line of bullshit hook, line, and sinker.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"August 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Campaign Manager: ‘I’m White, I Was Moved’ By Trump’s Remarks About Black People (VIDEO)","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump decided to reach out to black voters by traveling to an almost all-white town to tell African-Americans that they are uneducated, jobless and poor. Donald used inaccurate statistics, too. That was his minority outreach effort to black voters.On Sunday morning, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway attempted to defend The Donald s remarks.Mediaite reports that host George Stephanopoulos of ABC s This Week told Conway that many people found Trump s comments offensive. But many in the African American community saw that as insulting because they say most African Americans don t live in poverty and that Mr. Trump was making those comments in communities that are more than 90 percent white,  Stephanopoulos remarked.But Conway explained that she lives in a white community and said she was very  moved  by the remarks. Those comments are for all Americans. And I live in a white community. I m white. I was very moved by his comment,  she said.  In other words, he is trying to tell Americans that we can do better. And the thing that he said that I think got a great deal of resonance is that maybe Hillary Clinton looks at you as voters as your   takes you for granted. I look at you as people. Once again, we see that others within the Trump camp have to clarify their candidate s controversial remarks. We re going to need a Donald Translator if this babbling man-baby gets the keys to the White House. And you   again, George, if you think 58 percent of unemployment in the African American youth community is a good idea,  she continued, adding,  then absolutely please go vote for Hillary Clinton, everyone. She actually repeated the false statistics that Donald used that have already been debunked. In order to arrive at  58 percent, one would have to add in all black youth who are currently enrolled in high school and college. But that s not racist at all, mkay? But he s saying, you can t do any worse,  she concluded.Watch:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EH3zk0NShI]There s nothing like a white person explaining to black people how they should live   and by using false statitisitics. In 2014, Donald tweeted,  President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community   they have fared so poorly under his presidency. We re sure Ms. Conway doesn t find that offensive either.A 70-year-old white man feels that African-Americans should be  controlled  and that s the same white supremacist thinking that also supports his candidacy. Imagine that. What a coincidence.In June, Trump was found to have garnered a whopping one percent among African-American voters. It s only surprising that he has any support at all.Featured image via screen capture.

 WATCH: Louisiana Governor Tells Republicans To Stop Whining About President Obama,"Once again, Republicans are throwing a hissy fit because President Obama did not cut his vacation short to go immediately to Louisiana, but Governor John Bel Edwards put them in their place.As Louisiana deals with historic flooding that has broken records while killing 13 people and destroying tens of thousands of home, Republicans have been complaining about President Obama not dropping everything to visit the state.But during an appearance on The Rachel Maddow Show on Thursday night, Governor Bel Edwards set the record straight.As it turns out, Bel Edwards thinks President Obama s presence would be a distraction that would force the state to shift people and resources to prepare for the visit instead of remaining where they belong.First responders and emergency personnel are still involved in the rescue and recovery phase of the disaster, so pulling them away from that effort would be unwise. Therefore, Bel Edwards appreciates that President Obama did not jump on the first plane to Baton Rouge. The president is welcome anytime he wants to come,  Bel Edwards said. I do want you to know, and your viewers to know, that within hours of me making a request for a federal declaration I got it from the president. He called me. I want you to know that I ve been speaking to Valerie Jarrett just about every day. He dispatched the FEMA administrator to meet with me for an entire day. Today I had the Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. We ve also had the four-star general who runs all of the guard for the country here today. Bel Edwards said he would prefer if President Obama waited a week or two before coming to tour the flood damage and gave an example of what has to done to prepare for such a visit by pointing out how the state prepared for Vice-President Joe Biden s visit when he attended a memorial service three weeks ago for slain police officers. It is a major ordeal, they free up the interstate for him. We have to take hundreds of local first responders, police officers, sheriffs, deputies and state troopers to provide security for that type of visit. I would just as soon have those people engaged in the response rather than trying to secure the president. So I d ask him to wait, if he would, another couple weeks. Bel Edwards also noted that FEMA has been embedded in Baton Rouge since last Thursday, so President Obama and the federal government were well prepared to respond to the flooding unlike President Bush was for Hurricane Katrina, which killed 1,836 people.Rachel Maddow also pointed out that the state would have had emergency funding for this disaster had former Governor Bobby Jindal and Republican lawmakers not crippled state revenue by giving massive tax cuts to the wealthy.Here s the video via MSNBC:In short, President Obama has not ignored Louisiana s struggle. He has done everything short of visiting the state. And if he did visit, it would only do more harm then good.Donald Trump, on the other hand, visited the state and he couldn t even be bothered to cut a check to help those in need. The only  help  he provided was to assist in unloading play-doh from a truck instead of food or water or any other useful supply that people actually need.Meanwhile, President Obama has given Louisiana all the assistance they could possibly ask for in order to help people affected by the flooding. That s what real leadership is all about. Republicans would be well-advised to follow his example.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 MAJOR Scientific Magazine’s Editorial Board Just BLASTED Trump’s ‘Lack Of Respect For Science’,"In July, a Washington Post editorial called Donald Trump  a unique threat to democracy.  This is entirely true. Trump has suggested building a wall to protect from  rapists  and  murderers  Mexico is  sending  to America. He has suggested rounding up members of a religious group, forcing them to be entered into a national database and wear a special little badge, and then be thrown into concentration camps.Trump has ordered his supporters to beat African-American protesters at his hate rallies, even suggesting that he will pay their legal fees if they are arrested while acting as his attack dogs. Hell,he even kicks his own supporters out of his events if he thinks they might be a little too dark for the room. But award-winning monthly science magazine, Scientific American, wants to remind you that he has about as much respect for science as he does a well-educated, black, gay journalist who recently converted to Islam.Four years ago, the magazine s Shawn Otto warned that  the new science denialism is creating an existential crisis like few the country has faced before. Otto wrote those words in the heat of a presidential election race that now seems quaint by comparison to the one the nation now finds itself in,  the magazine s editorial board wrote in a piece that will appear in September s print edition:Scientific American is not in the business of endorsing political candidates. But we do take a stand for science the most reliable path to objective knowledge the world has seen and the Enlightenment values that gave rise to it. For more than 170 years we have documented, for better and for worse, the rise of science and technology and their impact on the nation and the world. We have strived to assert in our reporting, writing and editing the principle that decision making in the sphere of public policy should accept the conclusions that evidence, gathered in the spirit and with the methods of science, tells us to be true.It won t come as a surprise to anyone who pays even superficial attention to politics that over the past few decades facts have become an undervalued commodity. Many politicians are hostile to science, on both sides of the political aisle. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has a routine practice of meddling in petty science-funding matters to score political points. Science has not played nearly as prominent a role as it should in informing debates over the labeling of genetically modified foods, end of life care and energy policy, among many issues.The current presidential race, however, is something special. It takes antiscience to previously unexplored terrain. When the major Republican candidate for president has tweeted that global warming is a Chinese plot, threatens to dismantle a climate agreement 20 years in the making and to eliminate an agency that enforces clean air and water regulations, and speaks passionately about a link between vaccines and autism that was utterly discredited years ago, we can only hope that there is nowhere to go but up.In October, as we did four years previously, we will assemble answers from the campaigns of the Democratic and Republican nominees on the public policy questions that touch on science, technology and public health and then publish them online. We will support ScienceDebate.org s efforts to persuade moderators to ask important science-related questions during the presidential debates. We encourage the nation s political leaders to demonstrate a respect for scientific truths in word and deed. And we urge the people who vote to hold them to that standard.If Donald Trump is elected President, it will be a precarious position for scientific research in general, and this is something that is important to remember.When you are speaking out against Donald Trump, remember to mention that he doesn t care about scientific progress.Featured image via Getty Images/Jeff Swanson",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" As Trump Collapses, Clinton Donations SURGE","As Donald Trump s support has crumbled in the past month, donations to Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign have been surging. In the most recent reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC), Clinton has just reported her best month yet of fundraising.The campaign ended July with $58.5 million on hand, up from $44.4 million on June 30, according to its report released by the Federal Election Commission on Saturday. Its $52.3 million raised and $38.2 million spent were both the highest of any month this cycle.Even more positive for Clinton, most of those donors were first time small-dollar donors, of the sort that have been so important to other candidates like Senator Bernie Sanders and President Obama. 58% of the money Clinton raised in July was under $200. Before, those donors represented 31% of her base.Clinton has spent most of the money on campaign ads in swing states, while Trump only announced plans for a meager advertising buy in the last week. He did not advertise during the Olympics, which most experts believe is a crucial time to reach prospective voters who aren t news junkies. Clinton bought time for an ad which highlighted Trump s habit of outsourcing the manufacturing of his clothing lines to other countries.According to the RealClearPolitics current average of polling, Clinton has a 5.7% lead against Trump nationally. He hasn t had the lead in a single national poll since the week of July 22, when the Republican National Convention was underway.Since then Trump has been involved in a series of controversies, including his repeated attack on the family of a fallen U.S. soldier. Allegations of underhanded dealings and connections to the Russian government eventually led to the ouster of his top campaign official, Paul Manafort. Trump has brought in the head of the bigoted website Breitbart.com, Stephen Bannon, to run his campaign in an emergency shakeup.Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Louisiana Flood Relief Worker Rips Donald Trump For Doing Nothing To Help Victims,"All Donald Trump did is unload some play-doh for a photo-op in flood ravaged Louisiana instead of doing anything tangible to help. And he just got shredded for it.Trump traveled to the state this week in order to boast that he somehow cares about the flood victims because President Obama and Hillary Clinton have yet to make the trip down. However, that s only because Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards asked them not to come because first responders are still rescuing people and their arrival would only divert effort and resources away from those who need it.Trump, however, doesn t care about anyone but himself so he visited anyway. Edwards said that Trump is welcome but he has to volunteer or write a check to help victims.But Trump barely did anything at all, and he certainly didn t write a check.Neva Butkus is a relief worker who has been on the ground in Louisiana working hard to help those in need. And when she found out about Trump s visit she ripped him a new one on Facebook for exploiting people who are hurting in a desperate attempt to save his imploding campaign. Alright, y all. I need to clear some things up as a BATON ROUGE RESIDENT who  has spent this entire week running donation centers, organizing volunteer efforts, and will be doing demo work on houses all this weekend,  Butkus began. Our Governor has explicitly asked Obama to NOT VISIT at this moment because our first responders are STILL saving people s lives. YES, It has been a week and there is still standing water. Tens of thousands of people are displaced. This is a NIGHTMARE and our governor does not want to shut down interstates that are BRINGING IN SUPPLIES just to escort our President into the city. Butkus pointed out that Donald Trump visited a Republican part of the state so that it would look like he is welcome there in the midst of the natural disaster going on.  He is exploiting an opportunity to look as if he is welcomed during a tragedy,  she said. Our Governor literally told him,  she continued,  that Trump is welcome in our state but if he s coming he better be volunteering or writing a sizable check to assist with recovery. A 60 second video of him unloading play-doh from a truck does not count. Indeed, one would think he would at least get a photo-op of himself unloading food or water or something. That s a Trump fail on a spectacular level.And then Butkus really lit Trump up. Trump. Seriously. Where is the check. Like where is the fucking check. My people are drowning. My co-workers and family and friends have lost everything. My friends and co-workers that haven t lost everything are taking off work (my boyfriend is taking PTO) to clean out people s homes and rip out sheet rock and carpet. Give us money or GTFO. I don t want to see you in your suit in AUGUST carrying boxes off a truck like you care about us. Louisiana is an incredible place. Baton Rouge is my home and I have watched people drop EVERYTHING to help one another during this time. The whole country seems to be floored by the generosity and love that our residents show each other during tough times, but to us this is normal. This is Louisiana. And you do not belong here. Here s a screenshot of the full Facebook smackdown.Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself for exploiting a tragedy to make himself look good. And Republicans should be embarrassed for letting him. President Obama s presence in Louisiana would not have done anything to help those in need of assistance. And in the end, Donald Trump s presence did nothing except distract from the rescue and recovery effort that should have been the focus. But as usual, Trump only cares about himself.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Adviser: Trump Should’ve Had A ‘Backdrop With A Burning Car’ To Appeal To Black Voters (VIDEO),"Donald Trump campaign senior advisor Jack Kingston appeared on CNN Friday to discuss Trump s efforts to reach out to voters of color. During the segment, Kingston said that  maybe it would have been nice if he [Trump] went and had a backdrop with a burning car  while speaking at a campaign event in Wisconsin in order to appeal to black voters. As a reminder, you are not reading The Onion  those are the real words that Kingston said while on television for the entire world to hear.During the segment, CNN host Brianna Keiler attempted to explain to Kingston that it isn t a good idea to try and reach out to voters of color by speaking to a nearly entirely white community. She also questioned the decision to reach out to a voting bloc that overwhelmingly supports the Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton. As per usual when talking to a Trump fan, Kingston says that Trump is doing far better with a group than polls show.Here s a transcript of the conversation:Keilar: He s polling right now at 2 percent with African-American voters. Is that the right way to attract a voting block that obviously favors Hillary Clinton much more than him?Kingston: Well first of all, our internal poll show us doing better than 2 percent, but the reality is he s going there and he s taking it to them. He s giving them a proposal. He s saying,  You know what? I m interested, I went to Milwaukee, I m here tonight, I want to talk to you.  And one of the things he actually said last night in North Carolina that kind of went uncovered, but he says  I don t want to preside over another generation of children who are left out of the American dream. Keilar: I have to stop you because you said he s going there. He s not, he s in Diamondale, which is 93 percent white. When he was in Milwaukee the other day, it was part of Milwaukee that wasn t dealing   I mean he, it s  Kingston: Well yeah, but Brianna he went  Keilar: It s almost completely white.Kingston: I mean, maybe it would have been nice if he went and had a backdrop with a burning car, but the reality is  Keilar: No no no no no, I m not talking about a burning car. I m talking about meeting with black voters.Kingston: Well, he met with David Clarke, who as you know is the African-American Sheriff of Milwaukee, and he s engaged with him. And his rallies are open to the public. Last night in North Carolina, we saw a lot of African-Americans. I wasn t sure about the crowd content tonight, but the reality is  Keilar: It s white. We checked.Wow. It s hard to imagine Trump s polling numbers being able to go down from a measly 2% from black voters. However, they might plummet to zero if they keep up with this pathetic voter outreach effort.You can watch the segment below, via Media Matters:Featured image from video screenshot",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH Trump’s Former Campaign Manager TOTALLY Forget That John Kerry Lost In 2004,"Corey Lewandowski is still beating the Trump drum on CNN, including defending Trump s campaign shakeup this late in the game. There s just one tiny problem   he s doing so by comparing this shakeup to John Kerry s shakeup in 2004 and we all remember how that election turned out.The comments came just after now-former campaign chair Paul Manafort resigned from the campaign, which just strengthened all the talk that Trump is past the point of no return and cannot win this election no matter what he does. Lewandowski tried to counter that by saying: This campaign is not the first campaign to make staff changes. If you look at John Kerry s campaign, when he was running, he was making changes as late as Labor Day, and don t forget we re still in August  No, I understand, but the change in 2004 that John Kerry made helped him actually do significantly better than what he was doing. So? Kerry still lost. There is no getting around that fact. Kerry lost by about 3 million votes and 35 electoral votes. Yes, it was a close election, but really? He still lost and we still got four more years of George W. Bush. It s hard to imagine that anybody of Lewandowski s age and background doesn t see that.This is the kind of ignorance that s pervading Trump s campaign. Things have gotten so pathetically bad that there are people saying the polls don t matter because his social media followings are huge and attendance at his rallies is huge. Tens of millions don t attend his rallies, and it should be patently obvious that his social media following is very heavily biased.Lewandowski is a perfect Trump proxy with his head full of cotton. The main difference between him and those currently on Trump s staff is that the cotton filling their heads is a little more coarse. Watch him completely screw up history below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Report: Hillary Clinton To Raise $1 Billion To Unseat GOP Reps. And Senators,"As crunch time nears and states are having their primary contests, the Clinton campaign is wasting no time in getting further ahead than the Republicans.In a new report detailed by Politico, Hillary Clinton and her campaign are setting course to raise over $1 billion to unseat vulnerable House and Senate Republicans, with the aim of knocking off 10 to 25 House seats from Republicans and taking back the Senate.Hillary Clinton will raise $1 billion for Democrats and the party will train some of their efforts   and that money   on defeating House and Senate Republicans. Party leaders privately concede that the Senate could be lost either way. But senior House Republicans say they re in good shape across the country, and see no evidence that the control of the chamber is in playRepublicans are especially antsy at these revelations, considering the Republican National Committee fell almost $10 million short in their July fundraising predications (they only conjured up $27 million). In that same month, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fundraising arm of the Democratic National Committee, raised over $35 million (not including the total $90 million in joint fundraising with Clinton), and has raised almost $20 million more than the RNC for the 2016 fiscal year so far.In contrast, Trump had a very good month for fundraising. Counter that with the RNC s pathetic monthly numbers, the money speaks for itself: the GOP is putting its trust (and money) in Trump and Trump alone.So while Trump is hurting down-ballot candidates and their efforts for re-election, Clinton is set to raise unprecedented amounts of money for the Democrats, all while having her own campaign to fund.Back in May 2015, Politico reported that Clinton s campaign sought to raise over $2 billion by the time the November general election rolled around. Considering the Clinton campaign has raised, per OpenSecrets, $375 million for her own personal campaign, $100 million in 2015 for down-ballot candidates in 2015, and over $60 million through the summer of 2016 (coupled with the goal of $1 billion by November), that leaves the campaign roughly $465 million off target.Still, the Clinton machine is dominating Republicans in fundraising, not just for the presidential candidate, but for everyone else involved.Clinton is serious about getting stuff done   she knows her policies will be  pie-in-the-sky  without support from Congress. So what does she do? She raises more money for other Democrats than she does for herself. Trump, on the other hand, hoards the money for himself while he s a billionaire. See how that concentration of wealth screws everyone over, Republicans? Ironic, isn t it.Featured image Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Here’s Proof Top Republicans Have Already Given Up On Trump,"Republican strategists and party officials are circulating a plan of action that they are close to enacting, based on the premise that Donald Trump will almost certainly lose the presidential election. The plan is a way for congressional campaigns to untangle themselves from the Trump campaign, saving their own skins in November.Party strategists are mapping out blueprints for down-ballot candidates, in TV ads and on the campaign trail, to present themselves as checks on a Hillary Clinton presidency. It s an approach that would essentially admit a Trump loss. In interviews, nearly one dozen Republican operatives said they had begun poll-testing the idea   which one labeled a  break glass in case of emergency  strategy   to gauge how the public would react to it.The last time Republicans essentially abandoned their nominee was in 1996, when it became clear that Senator Bob Dole would lose to President Bill Clinton. Clinton went on to win that race with 379 electoral votes and victories in 31 states and Washington, D.C. But Republicans were able to stop the bleeding and held on to House and Senate seats.Politico reports that the emergency election plan involves an appeal based on telling voters that Republicans want congressional seats in order to provide a check on the power that Hillary Clinton would have as President. Infamous Republican political operative Karl Rove seems to be on board.The deliberations extend to the highest levels of the party. American Crossroads, the influential conservative group that was co-founded by Karl Rove, has tested to see how voters would feel about Republicans casting themselves as being a check and balance to Hillary Clinton, according to four sources familiar with the deliberations.The existence of this plan, and the fact that so much of it is already mapped out, is very nearly a concession in the presidential race before it s even September.Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Embarrassing: NY Times Reveals Trump’s Companies Are In MASSIVE Debt,"A new report from the New York Times finds that Donald Trump owes twice as much debt as he reported on his public election filings.The NY Times reports: Beyond finding that companies owned by Mr. Trump had debts of at least $650 million, The Times Discovered that a substantial portion of his wealth is tied up in three passive partnerships that owe an additional $2 billion to a string of lenders, including those that hold the loan on the Avenue of the Americas building. If those loans were to go into default, Mr. trump might not be held personally liable, but the value of his investments would sink. The NY Times points out that Trump probably didn t lie about the amount of debt he has in his public filings, it s just a matter of the forms that were filled out not being designed for a person who has as complex financial holdings as Trump does.What s really interesting about the report, is that it also shows Trump s one of the very few criticisms of Hillary Clinton shared by some on the left (which he stole from progressives anyway) is now rendered completely invalid for him to make, due to it being completely hypocritical.The NY Times reports: An office building on Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, of which Mr. Trump is part owner, carries a $950 million loan. Among the lenders: the Bank of China, one of the largest banks in a country that Mr. Trump has railed against as an economic foe of the United States, and Goldman Sachs, a financial institution he has said controls Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, after it paid her $675,000 in speaking fees. Trump has positioned himself as a strong businessman throughout his presidential campaign. However, he has come under fire from Democrats as report after report comes out showing that he is actually a huge failure in the world of business. Most notably from Elizabeth Warren who has said that  Donald Trump is a loser. Count all his failed businesses. See how he kept his father s empire afloat by cheating people with scams like Trump University and by using strategic corporate bankruptcy (excuse me, bankruptcies) to skip out on debt. The report is damning and should give Democrats a few more talking points that show just how dangerous a Trump presidency would be for the United States.Featured image from Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 RBG BLASTS Republicans For Crippling The Supreme Court,"Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is blasting the Republican obstructionism that has crippled the United States Supreme Court. Ginsburg said that having only eight justices sitting on the high court is simply  not good enough  to deal with the crucial issues at hand.Speaking to New Mexico State Bar Association members who had gathered on Friday, Ginsburg explained that the short-handed court had been faced with important decisions in recent months that were unable to be dealt with properly because the court does not have the intended number of justices.When we are evenly divided, it is equivalent to denying review,  Ginsburg said.  There were important issues in these four cases that we were unable to decide, and they will come back again and one of them was the president s immigration policy.Ginsburg spoke of several recent cases that had been before the court but had resulted in 4-4 deadlock rather than a final decision, which left the ruling of lower courts in place. The cases she referenced included a key case on immigration, organized labor fees, and the ability of Native American tribal courts to decide controversies involving visitors.The Supreme Court has been operating with only eight justices rather than nine since the unexpected death of Antonin Scalia in February. Before his body had even had a chance to get cold, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that Senate Republicans would refuse to consider any nomination put forth by President Obama. So far, they have held true to their word and have refused to hold a confirmation hearing for Obama s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.Last month, Garland made history and now holds the record for the longest wait for a confirmation hearing of anyone who has ever been nominated to the Supreme Court. There is no justifiable reason that Senate Republicans have refused to give Obama s nominee a straight up or down vote. Meanwhile, the highest court in the land has been crippled by their absurd obstructionism.Featured image via Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Joy Reid Shuts Down Right-Wing Pastor For Lying In Defense Of Racist Trump,"A pastor shamefully lied in defense of Donald Trump on Saturday and Joy Reid shut him down HARD.During an interview on MSNBC, conservative  Christian  pastor Darrell Scott, who is one of the few black people in America who support the Republican nominee, pretended that Trump is not a racist and denied that Trump had anything to do with the birther movement against President Obama.Trump tried to sell himself to black voters on Friday in front of an audience of white people by telling them they have  nothing to lose  by voting for him. That led Reid to ask,  If Donald Trump makes a speech to black people when there are none around to hear it, did he make a sound? Reid turned to Scott and noted that Trump has made two appeals to black voters in recent days in places where the black population only makes up about 1 percent of the total.  Why is he making those appeals in front of almost exclusively white audiences?  she asked.Scott made excuses for Trump, claiming that it doesn t matter where he speaks because all African-Americans hear him. When pressed on why Trump has not accepted invitations from the NAACP, the Urban League, and the National Association of Black Journalists because he supposedly had better things to do already on his schedule.Reid smiled as Scott called Trump  a cultural phenomenon  who draws rock star crowds. Reid then zinged back that those crowds are devoid of black people.Reid slammed Trump for pushing the false notion that every black person in America is living in poverty and going to failing schools and then asked Scott about Trump s history of housing discrimination, which has been cited by the Justice Department because the Republican nominee refused to rent to black people.Scott claimed that it was just an accusation and denied that Trump discriminated against black people, but the record shows that Trump settled the case with the government because there was a strong case against him, hardly the action of a man who didn t commit such an offense.Reid then asked Scott about Trump s prominent role in the birther movement. Despite multiple video tapes of Trump pushing the birther conspiracy and demanding President Obama s birth certificate, Scott also denied that Trump had anything to do with the movement. Don t tell me you agree with the bitherism, sir,  Reid pleaded.  Don t tell me you agree with that. Scott replied by claiming that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement, a notion that is totally false. And Reid shut Scott down for blatantly lying on her show. That s wrong. Even a pastor cannot make things up on this show,  she cautioned. I respect you as a pastor, but you re not going to come on and make things up. Here s the video via MSNBC.Donald Trump is desperately trying to save his flailing campaign and that s the only reason why he is making feeble attempts to court black voters now. If he really cared about black people he would have been courting them from the beginning. Instead, he has been palling around with white supremacists and encouraging violence against black protesters at his rallies. Scott can t sit there and call himself a man of God while lying through his teeth to defend a bloated racist. It s just not going to fly.Featured image via screenshot",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Black Panelists SHUT DOWN Trump Fan For Saying Trump Is A Civil Rights Leader (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s efforts to reach out to voters of color has been going about as terrible as one might expect it to go. Kayleigh McEnany, an avid Trump supporter, took part in a panel discussion on CNN s Anderson Cooper 360   where she attempted to continue that campaign. Not surprisingly, all she did was got shut down by the black members of the panel, Bakari Sellers and Angela Rae.McEnary began the panel discussion which revolved around black issues, by shouting down the black panelists, citing statistics about black people and poverty, saying that: You might think a 27.2% poverty rate among African American individuals is a good thing but  At that point, McEnary is interrupted by Rae who insists that no one had made that claim, asking her to retract the statement.That s when the panel really began to go into melt-down. McEnery tried to position Trump as a civil rights leader who  was on the cutting edge of civil rights  because he fought for inclusiveness in his clubs. While Trump might have expanded his customer base to include black and Jewish Americans. the other panelists were not buying it for a moment that Trump was a civil rights leader.What McEnery failed to mention, but Rae didn t, is that Trump only began to allow black and Jewish Americans into his clubs after he had been sued for housing discrimination.The best moment of the panel discussion is when Rae lays her thoughts out on the matter. She does not hold back, saying: If you want Donald Trump to say something that s meaningful to black people, and I m not going to be the spokesperson for all black people tonight, but what I m going to tell you is this. Plain and simple. He can disavow his racist butler. He can apologize for those two housing discriminations from the Department of Justice. He can tell me that that Black Lives Matter protester who he said deserves to get beat up, he can retract that and apologize for that. He can tell me that he never meant to say those legal fees of that guy that punched that black man in the face at his rally, should ve happened. He can apologize for the Indian man that was thrown out of his rally today. He can apologize to the Central Park Five  Sellers interrupts to say  All five of them. for taking out that full-page ad on them   I m not done, I m just getting started and I haven t even got to last July,  Rae continues.  My only point to you is this: Donald Trump doesn t just have a messaging problem. He has a message and belief problem, Kayleigh, and he has to   he has to hear it from more than Rhinestones and Polyester, his two little imps that go out on the trail for him.

 #NeverTrump GOP Rep.: ‘Not One Character Trait In Trump I’d Want My Son To Emulate’,"There has been a lot of talk about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s character and temperament when it comes to his being fit to serve as president. There is good reason for this, considering the unending litany of offensive things he s said and done over the last year or so during his travesty of a presidential campaign. He has accused former rival Ted Cruz s father of being in on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, mocked a disabled reporter, accused Fox host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly of being menstrual when she challenged his derogatory comments about women, picked a fight with a Muslim military family who lost a son in the Iraq war the list literally is too long to even scratch the surface of the appalling and horrific statements here.Well, people in Trump s own party are unhappy with their standard-bearer on a pretty big level, and many are refusing to support him. Some, including a former Romney 2012 official, are even supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton just to keep Trump out of office. That is how bad it is.There s now one more Republican to add to that list: Rep. Scott Rigell (R-VA). Rigell is no moderate, either. He gained his congressional seat as a Tea Partier, so he s as right wing as they come and then some. However, he simply cannot stomach Trump. Rigell has been firmly #NeverTrump for quite some time, and vocally so. In his latest blasting of his party s nominee, Rep. Rigell spoke with TIME Magazine, and said the following:Featured image via Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sheriff Joe Arpaio Is FINALLY Facing Criminal Prosecution,"After 20 years of corruption, millions of dollars wasted in ethics charges, and a stain on the integrity of law enforcement, Sheriff Joe Arpaio will finally be facing criminal prosecution.After being found guilty in civil court for being in contempt of court, U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow, a Republican appointee, recommended that prosecutors bring forth criminal charges against Arpaio, second-in-command Gerard Sheridan, and Maricopa County Sheriff s Office Captain Steve Bailey. Also recommended for prosecution is Arpaio s attorney, Michele Iafrate.Two months ago, Arpaio, Sheridan, Bailey and Iafrate were found guilty in civil court of violating court orders to halt a process used by the Maricopa County Sheriff s Office that included elements of racial profiling. Not only did the Office, at the behest of Arpaio, intentionally disregard the orders, those named in the civil suit lied about doing so, even while under oath.In his order, Snow, who wrote 22 times that the defendants had  intentionally  broke the law and court order, said:Criminal contempt serves to vindicate the Court s authority by punishing the intentional disregard for that authority.In other words: Arpaio and his thugs aren t above the law.Congratulations, Republicans, while you all were screaming  lock her up  at the RNC, one of your keynote speakers, Mr. Arpaio himself, is being dragged into court to face criminal charges.Arpaio s legal team said they of course would be appealing the decision in civil court and challenging the recommendation for criminal charges.Even with Trump on the ticket, Arpaio is in the fight of his life to retain his seat as Sheriff of Maricopa County. After seeing his support shrink in every election since his first one   1994   Arpaio faces his toughest re-election bid yet, with multiple polls showing Democratic challenger Paul Penzone ahead in the race, something that has never happened to Arpaio (and similarly with John McCain in his race against Ann Kirkpatrick).If all goes according to plan, the voters will kick Arpaio out of office and a criminal court will finally find him guilty of abusing his power. Nothing would be better than seeing Arpaio in the pink underwear in Tent City.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump To Black Voters: You’re Poor, Your Schools Suck, And You Don’t Work","Donald Trump has once again showed why he will only have white, male support. In a recent  shakeup  which entails  staying on script,  the GOP nominee made his much anticipated pitch to African American voters.And just as one would expect, it went horribly, horribly wrong.Trump actually said no joking around   that black people should vote for him because they have nothing left to lose: What do you have to lose? You re living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What do you have to lose? This speech was delivered in a community   Lansing, Michigan   which is 93 percent white and less than one percent black. If Trump is serious about courting black voters and sympathizing with their struggles, he should go to Harlem, Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit, and other areas where the black population is at least above 25 percent.After telling black voters that their livelihood sucks and that they all belong in low-income socio-economic conditions, Trump made the bold prediction that he, with less than three months to go until election day, would win 95 percent of the black vote. The sheer arrogance and misguided gobbledygook espoused out of his mouth should alone be the disqualifying factor.Trump is polling at 1 percent with black voters. In less than three months, he s going to have to convince 94 percent of the black population he s  with  them. Like everything else, Trump is setting himself up for failure.The man who has been sued for housing discrimination against blacks is now all of a sudden going to be their savior, just like middle class America s? The man who pointed to a random black man and screamed  look at my African American  is the one who will  produce  for the black community?Trump missed one very key (and detrimental) point in his speech: not every black person is in poverty. Not every black person goes to a broken school. Not every black person is unemployed. The dog whistle stereotypes that Trump perpetuated were not meant to showcase black plight   it was political red meat for his racist base of support.And to answer Trump s question of  what do you have to lose?  the answer is quite simple: everything.With his candidacy breathing new life into the white nationalist movement, anybody who isn t a white, Christian male has something to lose from a Trump presidency, and that especially includes African Americans.The Clinton campaign commented swiftly on Trump s racist, offensive and misleading remarks, saying:Donald Trump asks what the African American community has to lose by voting for him. The answer is everything from a man who questions the citizenship of the first African American President, courts white supremacists, and has been sued for housing discrimination against communities of color. Trump painting the entire community as living in poverty with no jobs continues to show he is completely out of touch with the African American community.Trump may have just cemented his losing streak with black voters.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"August 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Even Trump’s New Campaign Manager Demanded He Release His Taxes (VIDEO),"The problem with running for President in the 21st Century is that nearly everyone has a Google page or 1,000 about them, and often, video to back it up. That s the case with Kellyanne Conway, who was named Donald Trump s new campaign manager in his second attempt to shake things up.In April, Conway appeared on CNN, where host Don Lemon asked her about an  alliance  between John Kasich and Ted Cruz. Conway, who wasn t working for Trump, or apparently even supporting Trump, at the time, thought the alliance was fine, but Trump s refusal to release his taxes wasn t.Then head of a super-PAC supporting Trump rival Ted Cruz, Conway was asked in an April 25 CNN interview if the  alliance  between John Kasich and Ted Cruz was fair.  Of course it s fair game,  she said.  Oh absolutely. It s completely transparent. Donald Trump s tax returns aren t, and I would like to see those be transparent. Here s the video:And here s Donald Trump s new campaign manager in April call for Trump to release his tax returns pic.twitter.com/pIxCCm39xj  John Whitehouse (@existentialfish) August 19, 2016That wasn t the first time Conway was critical of Trump, nor was it the last. Here she is talking about Trump s damaging rhetoric: Here s Donald Trump s new campaign manager in February saying Trump s rhetoric was  unfortunate for children  pic.twitter.com/zb0LwwX5Mg  John Whitehouse (@existentialfish) August 19, 2016On Feb. 10, Conway blasted Trump s claim that he is  for the little guy,  questioning his business ethics.Trump  actually built a lot of his business on the backs of the little guy  she said on CNN, adding that Trump is known for  not paying contractors after [they have helped him] build something. She also sharply critiqued the businessman in the past over Trump University, his use of personal insults, and simply  saying things that aren t true,  the left-leaning group said.Source: The HillIn other words, it s becoming increasingly clear that Trump surrogates souls can be bought and sold, although it s not clear for how much. As for Trump, perhaps the appeal is that as a lawyer, Conway once helped Paula Jones in her sexual harassment case against Bill Clinton.Featured image via Gage Skidmore at Flickr",News,"August 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Kaiser CEO LOVES Obamacare – Thinks Aetna Did It Wrong,"You ve probably seen the headlines that Aetna, one of the largest providers in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, has pulled out. Critics of Obamacare had nothing but schadenfreude. They told us Obamacare was doomed and this was proof. As it turns out, Aetna s move was less about the viability of Obamacare (as they claimed) than about a personal and political vendetta against the President, whose administration denied a merger between Aetna and Humana.The CEO of one of the largest providers in the network thinks Aetna is completely wrong. Bernard Tyson of Kaiser Permanente thinks Obamacare has been great for his bottom line and that if Aetna was in fact losing money, it was because they were bad at managing it.Tyson does understand that it s a tough market. People have been sicker than anticipated, which makes sense. If you give millions of people who haven t been able to afford medical care medical care, it will take a few years to bring their health up to that of people who have had insurance. Congress hasn t helped either. Republicans have blocked the assistance that was being offered to the insurance companies to help with the transition.But, according to Tyson, that DOES NOT mean that Obamacare is a failure. The idea that I would turn my back on a segment of the American population who really needs the coverage and the care I m in for the long haul,  Tyson said.  And I m cautiously optimistic that at some point, we begin to make sure we have the right regulations, meaning oversight, to make sure the market is behaving like it was intended. Kaiser has made a  slight margin  overall on its ACA plans, Tyson said. Centene Corp., Molina Healthcare and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida similarly have found ways to make money on the exchanges. Narrow networks of hospital and doctors, as well as high deductibles, have worked for Medicaid plans like Centene and Molina. Florida Blue has relied on higher premiums than its peers.Source: Modern Health Care</blockquote>Another problem is that the insurers themselves may be pricing themselves out of the market because of the *drum roll* free market. There were conscious decisions made in the pricing of the product when it first started that did not hold logic to the marketplace,  Tyson said.  This is not rocket science. There s a pool of people to take care of, there s an underwriting process, and there were decisions made that   I m going to consciously underprice, and what I m going to do is gain market share and over time it s going to work itself out. Here s the full interview. It s quite interesting, and if you live in a Kaiser market, it might be worth supporting them:Featured image via video screen capture.

 Democrats Are Pushing A Bill On Tax Returns That Has Donald Trump Scared Sh*tless,"What is the one thing that might actually scare Donald Trump? That s right   the prospect of releasing his tax returns has him terrified. The mere thought of making them public, just as every single presidential candidate in recent memory has done, is more abhorrent to him than his sexual obsession with his daughter is to the rest of us. But unfortunately for The Donald, he may not have a choice in the matter if Senate Democrats have their way.The Connecticut Mirror reports that Senators Chris Murphy and Ron Wyden have come up with a solution to Trump s nonsensical refusal to be honest with the American people about his taxes   something even George W. Bush was able to accomplish:Partnering with fellow Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Murphy on Thursday pressed for votes for a bill that would require all presidential candidates from major parties to make public their tax returns within two weeks of their parties  national conventions. The effort is part of a renewed Democratic campaign over Trump s tax filings.In keeping his tax returns under wraps, Murphy said Trump is violating a  40-year-standard of campaign transparency and may even be running for president to change tax laws that benefit his companies. This is an extraordinary moment in which the candidate may be seeking the presidency to protect his investments,  Murphy says of his effort.What is Trump hiding?  Many people are saying  he has made substantial donations to NAMBLA   the North American Man-Boy Love Association   he does not want to become public. While this is a long-shot, as the organization is not actually tax exempt and would not show up on Trump s tax returns, it is clear that he fears their release. In any case, the  Presidential Tax Transparency Act  would let the public know all of Trump s dirty little tax secrets he desperately wants to keep hidden.In fact, it would force the FEC to post candidates  returns on the official website for all to see anytime they wish if the candidate did not voluntarily disclose them within two weeks of their party s national conventions.So far the bill only has five co-sponsors, including Tim Kaine, but the idea seems popular.Not only would this be a great idea, but it would lead to the most hilariously humiliating concession speech one can imagine.Featured image via Getty Images/Brian Bianco",News,"August 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Kicks His Own Teen Supporter Out Of Rally ‘For Having Dark Skin’ (VIDEO/IMAGE),"It s no secret that Donald Trump has a hard time with not only attracting minority voters, but also the votes of millenials that have grown up in a less racist, more diverse and accepting country than the America that Trump wants to enforce if he wins this election.But there are still young voters that are attracted to Trump, like 18-year-old Jake Anantha from Charlotte, North Carolina. Rather than be thankful for Anantha s support at a time when Trump is basically dying in the polls, the Trump campaign decided to kick this young Republican out of a rally on Thursday because he wasn t white.Jake was more than excited to attend Trump s event and give Trump his first primary vote. He was even wearing a Trump shirt to the rally, but his joy quickly left him when he was removed by police from the Charlotte Convention Center because the Trump campaign had accused him of being a protester. Jake s only  offense  was  having dark skin,  according to Ramesh Anantha, Jake s father.Ramesh complained that as a young person of color, his son should have been been treated with respect   especially since Trump s rally was about supporting minorities. Ramesh, whose parents immigrated from India, said, It s unbelievably ironic  and argues that his son should have been looked at as a perfect Trump supporter. He should have been somebody they re putting up on stage. Screenshot of Jake being removed by securityAccording to the young supporter himself, this incident has changed his mind about supporting Trump, now that his campaign s true colors have shown. In an interview on Friday, Jake said that initially, he didn t mind Trump s brash campaign: When I saw him on TV, I personally didn t mind his rhetoric. I defended him. When people called him a racist, I said he s a critic of our flawed immigration system. He s strong on Islamic terrorism. Jake had gotten to the rally early and was able to get a position near the stage. He was just standing there innocently minding his own business when security tapped him on the shoulder and tried to escort him out. They said, We know who you are. You ve been at many other rallies. Jake tried to object and plea that it had been his first Trump rally and was not a protester, but police removed him anyway. The event had been private, so Trump s staff had full control over who could attend   and Jake was apparently not white enough. Forced to stay outside the Convention Center or risk being arrested, Jake watched white people enter the rally effortlessly. He said: I thought (Trump) was for all people. I don t believe he is for all people anymore. Why are all these white people allowed to attend and I m not? The Trump campaign has failed to apologize to Jake, and the young voter says that this incident has made him change his mind about Trump. He is now planning to vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson.Jake was not the only minority to be ejected from this event. Rose Hamid, a Muslim who was peacefully protesting by handing out flower pens, was also removed when Jake was taken out of the rally.

 Louisiana Governor Blasts Trump Over His Photo-Op Exploitation,"While Republicans try to make Louisiana s deadly floods  Obama s Katrina,  there is only one person getting flack for being a raging opportunist   you guessed it   Donald Trump.Louisiana s Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, blasted the Republican nominee for president after he showed up to Louisiana for a photo opportunity. While citizens are dying and being displaced by the thousands, Trump has decided he would exploit the carnage in an attempt to undermine President Obama.Remember when President Obama was chided by the GOP for not calling Gov. Rick Scott for two days after the Orlando massacre? Well, flooding has been going on in Louisiana for a week and still, Donald Trump has not reached out to the governor or any state leader tasked with handling the crisis. A spokesman for the governor pointed out:Donald Trump hasn t called the governor to inform him of his visit. We welcome him to LA but not for a photo-op. Instead we hope he ll consider volunteering or making a sizable donation to the LA Flood Relief Fund to help the victims of the storm.Trump, the self described billionaire and charitable man, should donate.While Republicans continue to bash President Obama, Edwards has gone on the record asking that President Obama not travel to Louisiana for at least a week until the state is more secure   out of respect and timeliness of those working to aid the state.Trump s newest campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the trip is  a decidedly nonpolitical event, no press allowed, going to help people on the ground who are in need. And what did Trump do as soon as she said that? He took questions from the press and said President Obama would rather play golf than help those affected in Louisiana. Even though President Obama has secured the relief funds for the state and has expressed his support and thoughts for those affected, the Trump train has decided to use the opportunity to smear him and once again make Trump look like the unsung hero of the day.So much for no media and not being political.Once again, Trump is exploiting and using people s pain for personal gain. He s done that his entire life, so why stop now.Featured image via Joshua Lott/Getty Images",News,"August 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Republican Lindsey Graham LOSES IT, Blames Trump For GOP’s ‘Death Spiral’","Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has been worried about the mayhem Donald Trump was going to subject the GOP to since the very start of his campaign, and now that Trump is failing miserably in the polls, Graham is afraid the Republican Party could lose the majority in the U.S. Senate.According to a New York Times article, Graham unleashed on Trump, who he says is in a self-created  death spiral  and continues to bring the GOP down with him. Graham, who is not supporting Trump, said: People are getting pretty nervous about our candidates because he s in a death spiral here and nobody knows where the bottom is at. And although Trump is choosing to live in denial about the fact that Hillary Clinton is leading him by so much that it would be nearly impossible for Republican candidates to survive, Graham is well aware of what is at stake. However, Graham says that it might be dangerous for the GOP to disavow Trump this far into the presidential race because it might discourage conservatives from showing up at the polls at all. Graham said: It s going to be like  Weekend at Bernie s    you got to make him look alive, even if he s not. After Trump had a few weeks of spewing some of the most offensive, controversial comments he d ever made, the presidential nominee made some massive changes to his campaign, although it s probably too late. Earlier this week, Graham said that Trump had alienated voters so much that he stands no chance against Clinton in November, no matter what he does. Graham said: Mitt Romney got 27 percent of the Hispanic vote. By 2050, a majority of the country will be African-American, Hispanic, Asian and others, and we re losing demographically. We ve gone from 44 percent with Bush to 27 percent with Romney, and I don t think Donald Trump s gonna get 20 percent. Graham s right. Currently, Trump is only polling at 2% with African American voters   and don t expect the Hispanic population, whom Trump offended several times earlier this year, to be any more promising. Trump has single-handedly destroyed the GOP, and Graham knows it may never fully recover.Featured image via Justin Sullivan / Getty Images",News,"August 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Gets Mercilessly Mocked For Calling His Pathetic Apology A ‘Great Success’,"Donald Trump thinks his  apology  was a  great success,  and he just got owned on Twitter for it.During a speech in North Carolina on Thursday, the Republican nominee claimed to  regret  some of the things he has said during his campaign. Sometimes, in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. But, this is Donald Trump, so of course he backtracked on that moments later. In this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe myself. I will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours. Trump then took to Twitter to tout his speech as a  great success. The reporting at the failing @nytimes gets worse and worse by the day.

 Hillary Just Issued A Devastating Response To Trump’s Pathetic Apology,"Donald Trump has made it a point of his campaign to never apologize for anything, but he poorly tried to do exactly that on Thursday and Hillary Clinton nailed him for it. Sometimes, in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing,  Trump told an audience in North Carolina.  I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. But then he turned around and wiped that apology away by claiming that he will never lie to his supporters and that he will will always put their interests first. In this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe myself. I will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours. But Hillary Clinton did not let the Republican nominee get away with making a false apology.Her campaign issued a statement in response and it s absolutely perfect. Donald Trump literally started his campaign by insulting people,  the statement reads. He has continued to do so through each of the 428 days from then until now, without shame or regret. We learned tonight that his speechwriter and teleprompter knows he has much for which he should apologize. But that apology tonight is simply a well-written phrase until he tells us which of his many offensive, bullying and divisive comments he regrets and changes his tune altogether. The statement then goes on give a list of examples of all the groups Trump has insulted complete with citations. Then it lists Trump  past record of regret. On attacking the Khans, a Gold Star family: I don t regret anything. On assailing the ethics and motives of Judge Curiel:Asked if he regretted making his criticism of the judge personal,Trump said his side had been treated very unfairly.On calling immigrants rapists: No, I don t apologize. On mocking a reporter with a disability:Trump denied he had mocked the reporter and demanded his own apology.This is a fake apology by Trump. He s had more than a year s worth of opportunities to sincerely apologize for the horrible things he has said but he has only doubled down. He cannot possibly expect that this one sorry excuse for an apology will cover all of the harmful words he has vomited over the last year and two months since his campaign began. Nor should he expect it to be blindly accepted.It is said that it is  better late than never  but in this case it is too late. This slate cannot be wiped clean. Trump owes a personal apology to all the people he has demeaned, threatened, and mocked.The Republican Party needs to be held accountable for making Trump their leader and Trump needs to face actual consequences for all the bullshit he has spewed. That punishment and accountability can only come in one way. Americans need to vote on Election Day in November and send a clear message to Trump and the GOP. And that means a landslide victory for Democrats.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"August 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Fmr. Romney Campaign Chair Breaks Ranks, Gives Full-Throated Endorsement Of Clinton","Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been openly critical of Donald Trump, and of the Republican Party s continued support of the bombastic billionaire for president. Now, one of his former campaign operatives has written a stunning op-ed in which he roundly trashed Donald Trump and gave a rather glowing endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. That man is David Nierenberg, Romney s former finance chair. The piece appeared on CNBC s website. Nierenberg says of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton knows her stuff. She is emotionally mature and centered. She respects and enjoys working with people from all backgrounds.She has the diplomatic skills needed to break the gridlock in Washington and lead our country well. America needs a steady hand on the tiller. Despite being a Republican with ties to Mitt Romney dating back to 2006, Nierenberg had this to say about his party s current standard-bearer: Trump is the most dangerous major party presidential candidate in my lifetime, maybe in American history. His character, temperament and behavior are definitely not presidential.I don t think he s fit to be our president. He speaks positively about foreign dictators and acts like one himself.This year, however, watching and listening to Donald Trump s erratic daily bullying, ranting, bragging, scapegoating and name-calling, my conscience and my three adult children will not let me vote for him. Nierenberg also joined the call for Trump to release his tax returns. He said: For decades, candidates, including successful business people, have released their tax returns; why does Trump think he shouldn t follow the rules of the game? Defeating him has to be our national priority. He is exactly right. This is a time to put party before country. This is no longer about left versus right, Republicans versus Democrats. This is about having one candidate in what is, for all intents and purposes, a two-party political system who is qualified versus one who is a dangerously unfit demagogue. The choice is ours, America. Put party before country and vote blue in November.Featured image via Instagram",News,"August 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NYC Parks And Rec. BRUTALLY Mocks Trump As They Remove Naked Statue Of Him (IMAGE),"As was reported earlier, statues of a naked Donald Trump have been appearing all over the country.The artists that put them up had this to say about the installations: It is through these sculptures that we leave behind the physical and metaphorical embodiment of the ghastly soul of one of America s most infamous and reviled politicians. Ain t that the truth, and interestingly enough, their depiction of the real estate mogul/reality television star/egomaniac is likely remarkably lifelike.Take a look at the sculpture as it was in New York City s Union Square earlier on Thursday:s/o to whoever installed this Trump statue in Union Square last night pic.twitter.com/Cldd4qkgyI  JamesMichael Nichols (@jamesmichael) August 18, 2016Clearly kinda sorta inappropriate, yet still very entertaining and hilarious.However, knowing it really couldn t stay where it was, New York City s Parks and Recreation Department issued this hilarious statement: NYC Parks stands firmly against any unpermitted erection in city parks, no matter how small.

HA!Now, one could say this sort of remark from a city s Parks and Rec. department and especially from the city where Trump is from, is kind of a slap in the face. However, with Trump s clear narcissism, need for constant attention, and always talking how his plans are the biggest and the best, it s pretty obvious he s overcompensating for something. What that something is, who s to know, but the artists of this installation seem to have a pretty good idea.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"August 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" White Supremacist Stabbed Interracial Couple, Wanted To Go To Trump Rally","An interracial couple in Olympia, Washington, was stabbed by a man sporting white supremacist tattoos and markings. The attacker appeared to have racist feelings and spoke out against Black Lives Matter, according to an account of his questioning by police.The accused, 32-year-old Daniel Rowe, had tattoos on his body reading  skinhead,   white power,  and in the shape of the Confederate flag. The man in the couple he went after sustained non-life threatening injuries while the woman was grazed by his knife in the attack.Upon his arrest, Rowe allegedly told police that he had gone downtown after hearing about anti-police graffiti that had been put up Sunday night, according to court documents. He reportedly told police that if he were let go, he would head to a Donald Trump rally and stomp out more of the Black Lives Matter group. This has all the hallmarks of a hate crime,  said Deputy Prosecutor Joseph Wheeler. This black-and-white couple was simply expressing their love for one another,  he added.Black Lives Matter has been demonized both by conservative politicians and right-wing media like Fox News Channel, where host Bill O Reilly has compared the movement to the Ku Klux Klan.This is not the first apparent hate crime to be connected to Trump s campaign. In addition to various non-criminal incidents around the country, a Latino man in Massachusetts was beaten up by Trump fans as they cited the candidate and discussed deporting him.Trump himself has directed his rally attendees to be violent towards protesters, including those there on behalf of Black Lives Matter. Trump publicly offered to pay the legal bills for one man who punched a protester, and cheered on the idea of punching people who disrupt his events.By comparison, Hillary Clinton has said  black lives matter,  and has featured mothers who have lost a child as a result of police brutality as part of her campaign as the  Mothers of the Movement.  They spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this summer.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Gives His First Apology Ever And Swears He’d ‘Never Lie To You’,"Donald Trump gave his first ever apology on Thursday. It was half-assed and the work of a teleprompter, but regardless, he did manage to spit out the words. The Republican nominee told the crowd at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina that he  regrets it  if he at times has said the  wrong thing  and  caused personal pain.  At the same time, he said that this should all be excused and ignored because  too much is at stake. As you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I ve never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I ve never been politically correct   it takes far too much time, and can often make it more difficult to achieve total victory.Sometimes, in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. Trump then attacked the honesty of his rival, Hillary Clinton, and swore that he would  never lie  and would always put the interests of his voters first. In this journey, I will never lie to you,  Trump promised the crowd. I will never tell you something I do not believe myself. I will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours.Trump said that Clinton  has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time,  which is particularly ironic coming from a man who was awarded Lie of the Year by Politifact in 2015. So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day,  he said.So those  wrong things  he has said, the ones he regrets so much, like when he said that all Mexicans are rapists. Yeah, well, that was just him being  too honest.  What a great apology. The best apology.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Fans Threaten Jewelers Who Donated Ivanka Money To Hillary: ‘Karma’s A B*tch!’,"Jewelry designers Jill Martinelli and Sabine Le Guyader of Lady Grey in Brooklyn left Ivanka Trump a note with her recent purchase. Let s just say the two designers aren t fans of her father s. In the note, the two thanked her for her order but added that they were donating the proceeds to the American Immigration Council, the Everytown for Gun Safety organization and the Hillary Clinton campaign.The handwritten note was signed,  Best, Jill + Sabine,  with the Instagram photo of the letter captioned,  Dear @ivankatrump, #thanksbutnothanks #payitFORWARD. While we were flattered to receive an order from Ivanka Trump, our social and political views couldn t be further from those of the Trump campaign,  Marinelli told The Cut.  When we received her order, we instantly felt compelled to take the money and donate it to a few organizations that were more aligned with our ideals. That was too much for Trump fans to handle so they besieged Lady Grey s Instagram and Facebook pages.One commenter went there, stating,  Your company is f*cked!! Loooooosers !

 WATCH: Trump’s Desperate Spokeswoman Pushes Hillary Brain Disease Conspiracy,"Katrina Pierson, Donald Trump s official campaign spokeswoman who appears to have a permanent spot in front of a cable news camera, added to her long list of bizarre claims and blatantly false lies by alleging that Hillary Clinton has a brain disease.Pierson threw out the conspiracy theory on MSNBC on Thursday evening.Speaking on MSNBC, Katrina Pierson alleged that Clinton has a disorder called dysphasia, a condition brought on by brain trauma that erodes a person s ability to speak or comprehend language. What s new are the other reports or observations of Hillary Clinton s behavior or mannerisms   as well as her dysphasia, the fact that she s fallen, she has had a concussion, there are really interesting things out there,  Pierson said.The Trump campaign has been echoing conspiracy theorists like radio host Alex Jones (who believes 9/11 was an  inside job  by the government) and Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone (he thinks that LBJ had John F. Kennedy killed) for the last few months. And Trump of course was the lead spokesperson for the birther conspiracy theory that alleges that President Obama was not born in America.Along with these conspiracy theorists, right wing media outlets like the Drudge Report and Fox News  Sean Hannity have been presenting a pile of false claims that Clinton s health is weak.Months ago, her campaign released a medical assessment from Clinton s doctor and found the former Secretary of State in good health. By comparison, the Trump campaign s health document was widely ridiculed at the time, as its hyperbolic language seemed to have come from Trump himself, and not a reputable doctor.The wild theories about Clinton s health have coincided with Trump s drop in the polls, as he has plummeted to be anywhere from 4-15 percent behind Clinton nationally. He is even tied or very close to her in multiple  red  states that have been easily won by previous Republican candidates like Mitt Romney and John McCain, including Georgia, Missouri, and even Texas.So more conspiracies can be expected.Featured image via YouTube",News,"August 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Anti-Trump Group Has Placed DETAILED Statues Of Him In 5 U.S. Cities (VIDEO),"Statues of Donald Trump have appeared in five cities across the country, and it s clear that they re not meant to honor him. They re almost caricatures, and they portray him stark naked in a rather ahem insulting way. The intent is essentially to unmask Trump, and portray him as the disgusting little prick he is.The statues were placed in L.A., San Francisco, Seattle, Cleveland and New York City. The one in New York City was quickly removed, but ABC 7 Chicago reports that the West Coast statues still stand. An activist group known as INDECLINE, which speaks out against Trump, issued a statement claiming responsibility for the works of art. They said their hope is that Trump  is never installed in the most powerful political and military position in the world. They also said: It is through these sculptures that we leave behind the physical and metaphorical embodiment of the ghastly soul of one of America s most infamous and reviled politicians. On their website, INDECLINE calls this particular protest  The Emperor Has No Balls,  and they ve made it very clear on the statues that they see Trump as the ball-less wonder of the GOP. A three-minute video on their website shows exactly how they made the statues, complete with sound bytes of some of the worst things Trump has said in his speeches. You can watch the video below, if you can bear it (warning: Explicit imagery, very NSFW):The Trump campaign didn t comment on the statues, but that may change at some point. Trump can t stand being portrayed in a bad light, and these statues make him look very bad, indeed.Nude statue of Donald Trump appears on Los Feliz sidewalk https://t.co/65Ot7SDqs6 pic.twitter.com/8scXOCwjFR  ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) August 18, 2016",News,"August 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Just Got Fined $10,000 For Improperly Using Trump Tower For Campaign Events","Donald Trump just got fined $10,000 for improperly using the atrium of Trump Tower for campaign events, which violated an agreement between Trump and the city that is meant to preserve public space.The public atrium of Trump Tower was repeatedly closed for the Republican nominee s campaign events, which ultimately resulted in an investigation by the New York City Department of Buildings. In New York City, it is common for buildings to have public atriums. This is done in an effort to preserve public space as developers continue to build office and residential buildings larger and larger.In June of this year, Trump couldn t be bothered to take the time out of his busy schedule to show up for a court hearing about a bench that was removed from the atrium of Trump Tower. As a result, he was smacked with a $10,000 fine.According to the Wall Street Journal, the bench in question was part of a public space agreement between Trump and the city.In January, the city ordered Trump Tower Commercial LLC to remove two Trump Store kiosks from the atrium of Trump Tower. One of these two kiosks sold campaign merchandise and accepted donations to Trump s campaign.The New York City Department of Buildings issued a statement regarding the $10,000 fine.The building owner removed kiosks and replaced a bench that s required to be in the atrium. However, the owner must still pay the $10,000 penalty levied earlier this year.Trump certainly seems to have a hard time following rules. As a narcissist, he tends to think that he is above the law and that the rules don t apply to him. He truly believes that he can just do whatever the hell he pleases. But it looks like the city of New York thinks otherwise. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that even a $10,000 bill will help that message to sink in.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"August 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GOP Starts OPENLY Admitting That They Royally Screwed Themselves Over By Choosing Trump,"Trump s appointment of Breitbart chief Steve Bannon, along with his decision to have at least two people at the top of his campaign who will let him run amok, has further frightened and infuriated Republicans to the point where they re finally seeing reality about the candidate they put at the top of their ticket. As the layers of their delusions continue to be peeled back, former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber says: Look, we are in a terrible position. The Republican Party has made a mistake of historic proportion and when you do that, you find yourself in a place with no good solutions. Trump s idiocy has started to affect down-ticket races all across the country, particularly in the Senate. Senators in tight races saw their numbers drop considerably between August 3 and August 15. This is good news for Democrats, but the GOP s continued insistence that Trump will, ultimately, work for them is rapidly becoming a pipe dream.It s hard to feel sorry for them over that, though, because they re the ones who stuck themselves with a candidate who can t even run a cohesive campaign. In fact, Weber sees conniving manipulation in Trump s decision to have three people managing his campaign: We now have a CEO, a campaign chairman and a campaign manager. That tells me that no one is in charge of this campaign. Trump is playing these three people against each other. Indeed, since the campaign manager is still Paul Manafort, Trump could be playing him against the other two. When Manafort replaced Corey Lewandowski as campaign manager back in June, everyone saw it as a sign that Trump was ready to take on the mantle of campaigning for the general election. They expected a pivot, effected in part by Manafort.But he s not pivoting, and he won t. Manafort failed miserably there. Since Trump s strategy of alienation worked so well during the primaries, he can t see any reason at all to change: I am who I am. It s me. I don t want to change. Everyone talks about  oh are you gonna pivot?  I don t want to pivot. I mean you have to be you. If you start pivoting, you are not being honest with people. That s a laugh coming from the man who spreads lies as easily as people spread the common cold. It s even sillier coming from someone who s trailing so badly in the polls that he s reduced to tweeting the ones where he s only a couple of points behind Hillary.His campaign is quickly becoming the only Republican entity that s still mired in the delusion that he can win anything at all. Hell has frozen over: The GOP is starting to admit, outright, that they fucked themselves sideways with a rusty chainsaw in nominating Donald Trump for president.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"August 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 FBI Warns Republicans: Do Not Leak Clinton Email Files,"It s no secret Republicans are salivating to find something, anything, to take down Hillary Clinton. The idea of a third term for Democrats (at the hands of an accomplished woman) scares the hell out of them. So they do what they do best: lie, cheat, smear and bog down with endless investigations.Now that the FBI and the Department of Justice have cleared Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing, Republicans are once again faced with nowhere to go. They have hit a wall when it comes to pinning criminal charges on Clinton, who is increasing her chances of becoming America s next president.As part of a usual maneuver of transparency, the FBI handed over to members of Congress documents detailing  witness interview reports, including that of Secretary Clinton s interview, along with other materials from the FBI s now closed investigative file  in regards to her email controversy.In the age of the internet, it is almost guaranteed that whenever Congress gets their hands on anything potentially incriminating, embarrassing or politically expedient, it s leaked to the public. Both sides do it for different reasons, some for nefarious reasons, and others as a public service.But this situation is different. Republicans are hoping to use evidence in these documents as a  smoking gun  for the court of public opinion since their desire for indictment in a court of law fell flat. But there s one harbinger to this: many of these documents are deemed classified and confidential. And should any Republican, at the behest of their staff or them personally, feel compelled to leak the information provided, the FBI released a statement reminding them of what they are messing with:Consistent with our commitment to transparency with respect to the FBI s investigation to former Secretary of State Clinton s use of a personal server, the FBI is providing certain relevant materials to appropriate congressional committees assist them in their oversight responsibilities in this matter. The material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without FBI concurrence.Should someone from Capitol Hill leak the information, prosecution could be pursued. And should a Republican be stupid enough to allow such a leak, their moral high ground argument that Clinton was reckless with handling classified information would be completely and utterly decimated.While Republicans are hoping to be selective in their  discoveries,  the Clinton campaign has announced that they want all the documents pertaining to the investigation to be released, as to stave off biased selection of information at the hands of a bloodthirsty GOP:This is an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by Republicans for the purposes of further second-guessing the career professionals at the FBI. We believe that if these materials are going to be shared outside the Justice Department, they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks.While Trump continues to put off releasing his much anticipated tax returns, the Clinton campaign is calling for near-total transparency of the facts surrounding what is arguably the dumbest  scandal  she has been linked to.Be careful Republicans. Everything you ve worked for could come crashing down should a giddy staffer decide to be a  conservative hero  and leak information.Featured image via Mark Mekela/Getty Images",News,"August 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Justice Department Announces It Will No Longer Use Private Prisons,"Republicans are about to lose a huge source of funding as the Justice Department announces it will phase out its usage of the highly controversial (and highly racist) use of the private prison complex.The DOJ, under the leadership of Loretta Lynch, made the determination after evidence from the Inspector General s office showed private systems were less safe and less effective than state/government run facilities. Consequently, the DOJ has instructed all government contractors not to renew contracts with any private prison operations and to  substantially reduce  already existing contracts.In a statement, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates highlighting the many faults plaguing the private system: They simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in a recent report by the Department s Office of Inspector General, they do not maintain the same level of safety and security. Another cause for the discontinuation of the private system was the decline of America s prison population, which once exploded in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As recently as 10 years ago, the Department of Justice, under the Bush Administration, began contracting with private prisons to contain a population made up of seemingly petty crimes that disproportionally affected blacks and other minorities.In total, these 13 private prisons across the country will be losing their government contracts, putting a severe dent in their funding. Considering the report also detailed higher levels of assault   both by inmates and staff   and higher rates of contraband, this is a perfect example of wasteful spending Republicans are always decrying. Luckily, the Obama Administration recognizes this and is taking care of it, all without the help of the GOP.Currently, private prisons account for 12 percent of the nation s prison population at just over 22,000 inmates. According to Corrections Corporation America, the United States spent $639 million on private prisons in the 2014-2015 fiscal budget.Once again, the Obama Administration is cleaning up a big mess made by President Bush.A dark stain on modern America is finally breaking apart. Private prisons, a staple in the age of modern Jim Crow, have outlived their use (if they were ever useful in the first place). The Justice Department s decision to end its contractual obligations is a huge step in the right direction, but it remains to be seen if states like Arizona, who put funding for prisons over education, will follow the lead.Featured image via Allison Shelley/Getty Images",News,"August 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: S.E. Cupp Destroys Trump Adviser’s ‘Fantasy’ That Women Support Donald Trump,"A pawn working for Donald Trump claimed that women respect and are voting for the Republican nominee in November, and S.E. Cupp took her to the woodshed for it.During a panel discussion on CNN with Carol Costello, Cupp began by explaining the stark reality that the only voters Trump can count on right now are old white men, which is not nearly enough to catapult him to victory over Hillary Clinton. There s no outreach anymore,  Cupp said.  It s as if he s given up on them. And I just wonder if there are enough old male guy  old white guys in the country to elect him. I don t think so. But Trump supporter Tana Goertz, who appeared on the Donald s reality show The Apprentice, made the absurd claim that not only is Trump s campaign reaching out to women but that the effort is succeeding. How?  Cupp asked.  No you re not, actually you re not,  she continued.  There s math. There s polls. Indeed, polls show Trump is getting destroyed by Hillary Clinton right now and women are leading the way. Over 70 percent of women view Trump unfavorably and if the election were held today Hillary would win a higher percentage of women than President Obama did in 2012.But Goertz continued to pretend that their effort is working, citing her role in the campaign as proof. Oh, really? Oh, I m sorry, I m on the campaign and I m actually part of the women s initiative, so that s weird,  Goretz said, which drew a truthful jab from Cupp: There s polls that show you re not reaching women. That s just math. I m sorry to break it to you. Costello jumped in and asked Goertz for specifics on how Trump is reaching out to women, and her answer left a lot to be desired. The answer to that is he is having people like myself, his lovely daughter Ivanka, other strong Republican leaders, hold leadership conferences where we are getting out in front of large audiences of women who would like to hear why women like myself, why women like Ivanka, why other wonderful strong independent women who are making their own living, who are successful, who are highly educated, are voting and respect and are working for Donald Trump. In short, Goertz could only name herself and Trump s daughter as examples of women who support Donald Trump. And Cupp was quick to jump all over her for it. That s what we call anecdotal evidence. That s anecdotal and of course, there s some women supporting Donald Trump, that s a fact. But to ignore the fact that 70 percent of women do not like Donald Trump and that he has a huge gap between him and Hillary Clinton among women voters is a fantasy land. Here s the video via YouTube.Trump s campaign is still in denial that they are getting their asses handed to them in the polls. And the fact that Trump and his supporters are so delusional that they really believe women are coming around to supporting him is further proof that Trump s campaign lives in the  fantasy land  Cupp mentioned.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox Hosts Claim Hillary Has Brain Damage Because She Wears Eyeglasses,"Fox News is desperate to sabotage Hillary Clinton s campaign so they are continuing to launch outrageous lies about her health.Last week, Sean Hannity pushed an absurd claim that Hillary suffered a seizure on camera because she playfully acted like a bobble head doll while being pulled in different directions by different speakers. When the joke was over she then spoke and smiled, two things that people definitely do not do while having a seizure.As Newsweek s Kurt Eichenwald explained to Hannity earlier this week, People do not smile during a seizure while standing upright and then immediately launch into a coherent sentence. There s no smiling because, if for some reason the person experiencing the seizure has not collapsed to the ground in unconsciousness, the moment the body begins to move uncontrollably is terrifying. After a seizure, someone does not instantly jump back into a conversation, making jokes. Eichenwald should know. He has epilepsy.But Fox & Friends has picked up where Hannity left off and made a brand new claim on Thursday in an effort to cast doubt on the health of Hillary s mind.Steve Doocy, who was named in Gretchen Carlson s sexual harassment lawsuit against Roger Ailes, suggested that Hillary Clinton has brain damage because she wears prism eyeglasses. Is that the fact that when we saw Hillary Clinton wearing those prism glasses, a sign of brain damage and other things, and he s worried about the care she s getting so far,  Doocy said in reference to Dr. Drew Pinsky allegedly expressing concern for Hillary s health.Kilmeade then suggested that Clinton s glasses are connected to Benghazi, because conservatives will never stop talking about that. And if you want to   or remember, when she was wearing those glasses, remember when she made those famous line to Senator Ron Johnson,  What difference at this point does it make,  that s when she had those glasses on. Here s the video via Media Matters.This kind of speculation is why Fox should drop the  News  part of their name.Just because Hillary Clinton is wearing prism glasses it does not mean that she has brain damage. It means she has eye problems like 75 percent of Americans do.Hillary wears Fresnel prism glasses to correct double vision resulting from a concussion she sustained in 2012 after she fainted and fell due to dehydration.This in no way disqualifies her from being president. She merely has a vision issue that needs correcting.And if wearing glasses is a sign of brain damage perhaps Fox should have performed a quick search on Google for Donald Trump. Because they would have found this.So does that mean Trump has brain damage? I mean, that would definitely explain Trump s crazy behavior over the last year.Featured image via Twitter",News,"August 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CNN Panelist LAUGHS In Corey Lewandowski’s Face After Hearing New Trump Victory Plan (VIDEO),"As Donald Trump s campaign continues to sink deeper into its self-sabotaging downward spiral, it s becoming clear that even Trump s campaign surrogates and former staffers are having trouble trying to stay positive about the outcome of this election. In just the past few days, we ve seen them completely deny that Trump s campaign made some massive changes in desperation, ignore polls that The Donald is losing and now thanks to former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, they re holding onto false hope that Trump can still somehow win this.Earlier today on CNN, Lewandowski   who is forbidden by contract to say anything negative about Trump   tried to convince everyone that Trump was still on track to win this election because his biggest opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, was losing voters to Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson. Lewandowski said: This is not a two-person race. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are in this race. I would say Jill Stein should be in the debates. She s a person who is going to take away votes from Hillary Clinton. You just had her here on the show  At the end of the day, Donald Trump is going to win this election, he s going to win in states because Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are going to take votes away from Hillary Clinton. While Lewandowski clung to his delusions, CNN panelist Bill Kristol was sitting right beside him, shaking his head while smiling and muffling his laughter. When Kristol could finally get enough control over himself to speak, he dropped a major truth bomb that Lewandowski and Trump weren t going to like: That s the last recourse of a campaign that s going to lose. It s hoping third-and-fourth-party candidates are going to magically change the equation. At the end of the day, 38% of the American people think Donald Trump should be president, it s never gotten much above that number. You can watch Kristol giggle at Lewandoski s silly hopes below:.@CLewandowski_: Donald Trump is going to win bc Gary Johnson + Jill Stein will take votes away fr Hillary Clinton https://t.co/jvwPm42LGm  New Day (@NewDay) August 18, 2016Featured image is a screenshot",News,"August 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
