On Wednesday, Stachowiak had a few complaints about a recent report that highlighted his recent suggestion that  patriots  like him shoot black women and children  in the backs. According to Stachowiak, I am not only a drug addict but I was lying about him when I quoted the things he said.In his latest video rant, Stachowiak complained that  John Harper  posted an article condemning his racism and numerous suggestions that racists like himself murder black people on sight for everything from shoplifting to shoplifting. John Harper, you are a liar and a fraud and I m challenging you John to sue me for slander and defamation for saying that your website and that of Raw Story and the Washington Post are saying that I ve advocated for hunting down black women and children and shooting them in the backs. Since that s entirely what happened, I find myself wondering why he would make such a silly suggestion, but let s move on. These people are on drugs. John Harper apparently is a drug addict just like [police chief] Mark Kessler is an alcoholic,  he continues.  Now, how can I say that? Skipping over how he came up with his silly drug abuse claim, Stachowiak continued. He attempted, but failed, to walk back his remarks: I advocated that looters exiting stores should be shot   if they re running down the street, light  em up. I never said to aim and target children. What I said was that if children are in the group, they would be collateral damage. We can not allow these dangerous people to escape and cause more mayhem. Well, that s much better, Jim.  He continued, attempting to explain away his remarks about women: You mean just because it s a woman she can t be a criminal that should be targeted with lethal force if she s a looter or throwing a brick at a cop? No, Jim   no one should be  shot in the head  as you have oh-so-eloquently suggested if she is looting a store   and a brick is one-shot, inaccurate, and hard to throw any reasonable distance, so that should not end with a street execution. Nevertheless,  Johnny Infidel  as he calls himself on YouTube made it clear that he would even shoot an  80-year-old woman  in the head if she threw a brick a few inches toward a cop. That s just the kind of swell guy this particular former police officer is.But mixed into Stachowiak s latest ravings is something hilarious. You remember Mark Kessler from earlier? Yes, I mean the former Gilberton, PA police chief whose unhinged YouTube rants in which he threatened  libtards  made him famous and ultimately got him fired from his position. Well, it seems that Mr. Stachowiak fell for a little prank one of my friends has been playing on conservatives for years.You see, amid the Kessler controversy, a liberal troll who shall remain nameless created a fake  Police Chief Mark Kessler  Facebook page. This page has served as a source of laughs for many of us in the liberal Facebook community as we watch conservatives throw themselves into fits of rage when  Kessler  posts something off-the-wall or worse   actual facts regarding their insane theories. When Mr. Fake Kessler posted an article I wrote for Winning Democrats on the  shoot black people in the head  issue, Stachowiak noticed. He also noticed that  Kessler has been slamming the Bundy family heavily.Let s just say that Stachowiak is mad.  I want to inform you about another stooge that s working with the enemies of the Second Amendment,  Stachowiak says.  His name is Mark Kessler. Now if Stachowiak was smart   and he s totally not   he would have remembered that gunfire was almost a staple in Kessler s stupid videos. But, like I said, he s not exactly the whitest hood at the Klan rally. He has said that I am a terrorist, insane  Stachowiak says. He says that it s  very interesting  that Mark Kessler was removed as police chief, even though it s not very interesting.  Here s the interesting thing about Mark Kessler and you can check it out all over the internet. Mark Kessler was gathering names to turn in various patriot groups and militias to the federal government. He s openly admitted it. This part is true. In 2014, Kessler told Alan Colmes that he volunteered working with the federal government to weed out extremist elements in the far-right. He claims he  saved a lot of lives  in his work, listing numerous  patriot  groups he helped take down. Mark Kessler also has a fascination with anal sex,  Stachowiak adds (That s not really him, dumbsh*t).  Mark Kessler is a sodomite and that s something else no one has reported. Oh man.. The level of dumb this fool has is amazing,  the fake Kessler page posted.  I would pay to see this idiot take an I.Q. test.. I would expect him to achieve a solid 68. I mean SOLID 68. He is clearly a drunkard and a terrorist,  the anonymous troll says.  He should be studied and mocked.  In any case, Mr. troll finds him entertaining He told Addicting Info: Man I love that guy! Still not sure if he should be on a 72hr mental hold or have a new TV show. Watch Stachowiak s latest idiocy below, and feel free to mock him in the comments below.

However, there are many white folks who, despite the fact that they ll never walk a mile in our shoes, still see fit to partake in this condescending and insulting narrative. Once such person is Fox News  Bill O Reilly.O Reilly decided to engage in this activity on the Wednesday edition of his show, The O Reilly Factor, with two black guests. O Reilly s guests were a lawyer, Andell Brown, and a prominent faith leader, Rev. Jacques DeGraff. The conversation was regarding the fact that, for reasons obvious to most sane people, Trump is polling at an abysmal two percent with the African American electorate. O Reilly, however, seems to think that, despite Trump s flagrant and unapologetic racism, black people should vote for him and other Republicans anyway. He opined: Why isn t the African-American community saying, You know what? We had a black president who didn t help us very much. The Democratic Party hasn t really helped us very much. Maybe we go supply-side economics and look for a guy who s going to stimulate the economy that perhaps would be better.  Why don t they do that? This was after O Reilly tried to insist that Trump and his racism could be ignored for what he seemed to see as some greater good. Brown, however, took him down fast on that one: Well you also have to look at what Trump has said and done himself, not necessarily being, as you put it, demonized. She went on to remind O Reilly of Trump s racist tweeting of crime statistics that came from white power twitter users, saying, I mean, that was totally inaccurate. And of course O Reilly did the same thing with that line that all of Trump s racism apologists do, and insisted it was  foolish  but still not to be held against him because well, duh, it was only a retweet.O Reilly then proceeded to do what many whitesplainers do, and insisted that despite Trump s obvious bigotry, we d be, quote,  better off  with the GOP and should just ignore their rank racism. Rev. De Graff had clearly had enough by that point, and said to O Reilly: Black Americans like any other group in America are capable of determining their own best interests. And black Americans don t have a relationship with the Republican Party because of the hostile environment they ve fostered for eight years. Then again, this is to be expected from the likes of Bill O Reilly and Fox News. After all, they sincerely don t think they are racists, just because they re not into white power and Ku Klux Klan type activity. To them, that s enough not to be a bigot. Make no mistake, though   one can be a racist and hold racist ideals without going full on white nationalist. Further, whitesplaining is, in and of itself, a form of racism. Then again, those who engage in that sort of thing likely don t care anyway, and will continue.

She also signed a nondisclosure agreement with the campaign under the same name.But after a Feingold staffer began pressing Moss on some of her past work, her backstory started unraveling.

They also asked her whether she worked for the right-wing group Campus Reform and whether she gave a false name on her nondisclosure agreement.The Huffington Post goes on to report that in audio of a question and answer session with the woman she  was nervous and evasive, giving answers that certainly aren t typical of the usual enthusiastic political volunteer.

They attempted to seek a place to stay but were denied by one shelter. So they sought refuge in the home of a former member of their church.Perkins is also still trying to figure out why God would smite his home. We re gonna look for what God s gonna do in this,  Perkins said.  I m asking those questions and I m going to see. Here s the audio via Raw Story.Usually, it s customary to feel sympathy for people who suffer losses due to flooding, but this is a special kind of irony that needs special commentary.As we all know, conservative  Christians  are constantly telling us that whenever there is an earthquake or a hurricane or a flood that it s punishment by God over homosexuality or abortion or some other social issue that has them all in a tizzy, especially when that natural disaster doesn t affect them personally.Now, the idea that God is sending natural disasters to punish people is complete bullshit, but let s just pretend for a moment that that is the case. The Perkins household just got severely damaged by a  flood of biblical proportions  as stated by Perkins himself, and they were driven out of their home.So by conservative logic, that must mean that he is being punished for something. And since Perkins is an anti-gay bigot who wants to suppress women s rights, one could easily surmise that God is sending Perkins a message to stop being a dick toward other human beings. You know, actually love your neighbor and treat others the way you want to be treated.But Perkins will likely fail to see that message. He ll just twist it to his own advantage. Because when it comes right down to it, conservative  Christians  think natural disasters are only sent to punish others, but when they are affected personally they believe it s only sent by God to test their faith. In other words, complete and total hypocrisy.The moral of the story, however, should be that conservatives should stop claiming that disasters are punishments by God, because there is a such thing as karma and Tony Perkins is learning that the hard way.Featured image via Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And in Bannon, they see a media-friendly, ethno-nationalist fellow traveler. Latterly, Breitbart emerged as a nationalist site and done great stuff on immigration in particular,  VDARE.com editor Peter Brimelow told The Daily Beast.VDare is a white supremacist site. It s named after Virginia Dare, the first white child born to British colonists in North America. Brimelow said he and Bannon met briefly last month and exchanged pleasantries about each other s work.Richard Spencer, of the white nationalist group National Policy Institute also told the Daily Beast that he was happy to see someone who shares a similar world view elevated to a major position within the Republican Party.Since Bannon has been in charge of Breitbart, since the death of its founder Andrew Breitbart, Breitbart News has been the launching pad for this segment of the right that was once kept much further below the radar within the mainstream conservative movement.His elevation to the head of the Trump campaign is being seen as a triumph of this world view on the right, and Trump s campaign, with its explicit bashing of Latinos and Muslims, appeals strongly to this group.The nominee himself was slow to distance himself from the endorsement of former klansman David Duke, and Trump has often promoted the work of white supremacists who back his campaign on his Twitter account.Featured image via YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Because Nixon was so honest, but that s beside the point. Now, Richard Cross says that Hillary is the only choice, despite writing a speech that called her a liar and held her personally responsible for Benghazi. In an op-ed for the Baltimore Sun, Cross says he s faced with an inconvenient truth about Trump versus Hillary: Despite what I wrote in that nationally televised speech about Hillary Clinton, I may yet have to vote for her because of the epic deficiencies of my own party s nominee  I have never voted for a Democrat for federal office, but when I hear the president criticize the GOP nominee, I can t honestly disagree with him. He feels that the main question of the 2016 election is whether Muslim Americans are full and equal citizens of the U.S., and to him, the answer is  yes.  Also, like the rest of the sane world, he thinks Trump s racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric is just plain terrible: Now, the question becomes: Can we come together and find a positive solution to the issue of illegal immigration, just like President Reagan and congressional Democrats were able to achieve? The answer to that is,  we must.' With the addition of the white supremacy, conspiracy theory-peddling Stephen Bannon as campaign CEO, Trump s message and behavior are only going to get worse. Paul Manafort and the GOP itself have completely failed to rein him in, and he s surrounded himself with sycophantic clones; the only people who will give him everything he wants (except a win in November).Cross is not thrilled about the prospect of voting for Hillary, and still doesn t have much to say about her that s good. The idea of voting for her makes him very uncomfortable. But the man who asked if we can trust her with the presidency when we can t trust her to tell the truth dropped this truth bomb at the end of his op-ed: But the only prospect more terrifying than voting for Hillary Clinton is not voting for her.The reality of American politics today is, she is the only choice.

That s the world that Trump inhabits, and in that world, campaign staff that try to get him to temper himself, act more presidential, and less like a bully toddler, are the whole reason his poll numbers have crashed.In fact, Trump has felt  boxed in  and  controlled  by Paul Manafort and other staffers who  barely know him.  He wants to focus hard on riling up his supporters through  rousing  rallies and media appearances (again, because that worked in the primaries and the primaries are totally like the general). Manafort wanted less of that, and more real campaigning.Breitbart has been one of Trump s champions for a while now, and one former employee says that Bannon used Breitbart for his own personal gain, possibly including a way to get close to Trump s campaign. Under Bannon, Breitbart has become a fantastic website for white supremacists and nativists   the very people to whom Trump himself caters. Employees of Breitbart were afraid of Bannon, and with good reason: He is a vindictive, nasty figure, infamous for verbally abusing supposed friends and threatening enemies. [He] is a smarter version of Trump: he s an aggressive self-promoter who name-drops to heighten his profile and woo bigger names, and then uses those bigger names as stepping stools to his next destination. He is everything Trump is, only worse.Some GOP operatives are already saying that the choice of Bannon will effect a pivot, but it won t be the one that the party is hoping for. If Trump s campaign was dark, hateful, bigoted, nativist and dangerous before, it will be all that times a thousand under Bannon.Which is exactly what Trump wants. Forget the fact that, if that strategy was going to work against Hillary, it would have started working by now.

Donald Trump is running for president because he believes that he can help turn the nation around,  Manigault said.  More importantly, every critic, every detractor will have to bow down to President Trump. Here s the video via YouTube.This is just another sign that Donald Trump intends to rule like a dictator rather than a leader who gets his power by virtue of the people. America is NOT a monarchy. People do not bow down to the president. But that is apparently what Trump has in mind for anyone who has ever criticized him, insulted him, crossed him, or stood in his way.And that makes his close ties to Russian president Vladamir Putin all the more alarming, which is why legendary ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov has warned that Trump is acting an awful lot like a Soviet dictator. And he would know since he defected from the Soviet Union 42 years ago precisely because of the kinds of policies Trump is advocating for now such as oppression of people based on race and religion, building walls, and being a psychopath in general.Trump has even called for gun nuts to assassinate Hillary Clinton and has encouraged his supporters to chant in favor of locking her in prison. Assassination and imprisonment are exactly what dictators do to their political opponents.This is why Americans must exercise their right to vote this November   because if Trump comes to power that right may not exist much longer.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It does seem, though, that he s had a moment of clarity, even an epiphany. The man who has played a large part in demonizing Black Lives Matter finally gets it. At least he gets part of it. He gets why  All Lives Matter  is a really bad response.In the past, Beck has been especially critical of Black Lives Matter, who he accused of inciting  terrorism. Beck s comments were sparked by discussion over Black Lives Matter protesters  recent invasion of a Dartmouth College library, where the activists harassed white students, calling one girl a  filthy white bitch. They are terrorizing you,  Beck said of the incident.  What do you think that is when   when one of the girls, who supported Black Lives Matter at Dartmouth. And she was in the library, and she was studying. And they pulled her out of her seat.   She started crying. Beck said filling people with  fear  is the  first step to terrorism. I think we need to start calling it that,  Beck concluded.  We need to start being very, very clear. In the past, he even led a march for  All Lives Matter.  Things have changed somewhat, though, at least for Beck. While he s still not officially a Black Lives Matter supporter, he understands why All Lives Matter is stupid. In a news conference covered by the Washington Post, Beck relayed this analogy: All of us are sitting around a table, and we re all friends,  he said.  It s time for dessert, and everybody gets pie except for me and you. And you say,  I didn t get any pie.  Everybody at the table looks at you and says  I know. All pie matters.  You say,  but I don t have any pie! What about my pie?' Beck still says that the leaders of Black Lives Matter are  communists and anti-capitalists,  but he says that most supporters are not and that we really need to learn to speak to each other.For that, some conservatives are throwing Beck under the bus. Blue Lives Matter accused Beck of pandering to Black Lives Matter.Breitbart.com, whose CEO was just named Trump s campaign CEO, didn t like Beck s analogy either: While Glenn Beck would like people to believe he s insightful, critics of Black Lives Matter don t need his hectoring,  wrote Breitbart s Lee Stranahan, who is also based in Dallas.  The reason many people   including black critics of Black Lives Matter like [Milwaukee County] Sheriff David Clarke   say  All Lives Matter  in response to  Black Lives Matter  is to reject the underlying notion of identity politics. Beck is not a supporter of Trump. Is this a sign that the #NeverTrump movement can bring out a more rational right-wing? Conservatives are certainly in the midst of an existential crisis and many of them appear to be soul searching. Whether Beck has dug deep enough to find his soul or whether he happened to get his meds right that day will be sorted out over time, but for now, it s refreshing to hear someone on the right *sort of* get it.Featured image via J.

He sees a man who would make America closely resemble the old Soviet Union where freedom of speech is stymied and tyranny rules. He sees a man who would close America off to the rest of the world and a man who would stamp out any opposition against him under his boot heel.And that s why Baryshnikov has chosen to endorse Hillary Clinton for president in a video he released on Wednesday along with a written statement. While watching the presidential election unfold, and hearing Donald Trump s flirtations with the Kremlin, I feel compelled to add my voice to the mix   specifically regarding immigration   something I am obviously familiar with. I have never publicly endorsed a political candidate before, or inserted myself into politics in any way other than by voting, but this video is a direct call to action: We must elect Hillary Clinton as president in November. Forty two years ago I left a country that built walls to come to a place without them,  Baryshnikov said in the video.  But today, as a citizen of the United States, for the first time, I m hearing rhetoric that reminds me of the Soviet Union of my youth, where it was a crime, and continues to be, a crime to be different. Baryshnikov referred to Trump as a  dangerous totalitarian opportunist  and went on to voice his support for the Democratic nominee who opposes him. The America I love welcomes people of all nations, all religions, and supports all forms of human expression. America welcomed me, an immigrant, and that welcome has made my life possible. I trust her to lead us in the right direction, to protect the rights of all citizens, and to provide sane, steady leadership in a complex world. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is a wannabe dictator who hates facts and thinks he can do whatever he wants and say whatever he wants. He wants to oppress people based on their race and their religion and their sexual orientation. He treats women like objects and uses fear and hate to advance his agenda. This sounds frighteningly a lot like something you would find in the Soviet Union. But while Trump fits in with Russia, his political agenda runs counter to American values.If elected president, Trump would destroy those values and he would be Putin s puppet.

If you look at the story that he did in The New York Times on foreign policy, it was literally the transcript of what he said it wasn t editorialized at all. That s fair reporting. That was in response to Don Lemon saying that Trump is bashing CNN for repeating what he says and fact-checking it. So, basically,  fair  is no fact-checking, no discussion, just his words. Nothing else.All that does is give Trump a license to say what he wants, because then he knows the media won t call him on it. Of course, that s exactly what he wants to have happen.

It s called the Trump Youth. While they don t mention Trump s name anywhere other than in their own name, the purpose is clear: Donald Trump represents an end to globalism, an end to multiculturalism, and an end to what Liardi clearly sees as the myth of equality.In a video he s made for the Trump Youth, he speaks of the parasites that we must throw off our backs: These parasites, they want war, they want destruction, they want slavery, and they re getting it. And unless we hold them accountable, unless we take justice into our own hands, and throw these parasites off our backs, the world will come to chaos.  [emphasis mine]He goes on to preach fear about the  New World Order,  which is made up of the globalists that are trying to destroy the world. Watch his entire fear-laced spiel below: The Trump Youth are the  hero generation. What does that whole thing sound like? It s not just that Liardi sees globalists as parasites. Nazis considered the Jews to be parasites that fed on society, and were the root of their problems from the end of WWI, into WWII: In this war for the very existence of the German people, we must daily remind ourselves that Jewry unleashed this war against us  As early as 1922 the F hrer said:  We were also those who for the first time made major efforts to explain to the people a danger that had crept up on us, and which millions of people did not recognize, even though it threatened to ruin us all: the danger of the Jews The German people has recognized that the Jew has crept in like a parasite not only into our people, but into all the peoples of the earth, and that it is attempting to corrupt the original racial characteristics of the peoples in order to destroy them both racially and as states, and thereby rule over them.  [emphasis mine]On his own website, Liardi says of WWII: WWII was a turning point in human history. A battle of opposite ideologies. Nationalism vs Globalism, International Communism vs  Nazism Our world today is the world of the victors, the world of the so-called Allies.On one path you have globalism. This is the world of capitalism/communism  The world of blind  equality : All races, cultures and ethnicities are the same, the sexes are the same, each individual is essentially the same. In our sameness, in our equality we are all one homogenous goop, rootless and without an identity, able to be exploited by the tyrants, our alleged representatives that we have in power today. If you have no identity, one will be installed into you by the kosher forces of The State.  [emphasis mine]So there you have it. A blond-haired, fair-skinned young man trying to create a group to fight for the same nationalism for which the Nazis fought.

Moore believes that the only reason Trump was running was so that he could get a better deal on the next season of his reality TV show The Apprentice. Moore wrote that Trump:  never wanted to be president of the United States. I know this for a fact. I m not going to say how I know it. I m not saying that Trump and I shared the same agent or lawyer or stylist or, if we did, that that would have anything to do with anything. And I m certainly not saying that I ever overheard anything at those agencies or in the hallways of NBC or anywhere else. But there are certain people reading this right now, they know who they are, and they know that every word in the following paragraphs actually happened. Moore outlined that Trump had actually been bitter about a deal involving his shows, and felt this was a way to get more money out of it. Trump openly admitted that he was thinking about moving his shows to another network, and then launched a presidential campaign that was never meant to make it this far. So, on June 16th of last year, he rode down his golden escalator and opened his mouth. With no campaign staff, no 50-state campaign infrastructure   neither of which he needed because, remember, this wasn t going to be a real campaign   and with no prepared script, he went off the rails at his kick-off press conference, calling Mexicans  rapists  and  drug dealers  and pledging to build a wall to keep them all out. Jaws in the room were agape. His comments were so offensive, NBC, far from offering him a bigger paycheck, immediately fired him with this terse statement:  Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump. Of course, Trump s plans backfired because he found himself fired by NBC. But another thing he didn t expect, was that he had struck a nerve in America s most racist and hateful population. Moore said: And then something happened. And to be honest, if it happened to you, you might have reacted the same way. Trump, to his own surprise, ignited the country, especially among people who were the opposite of billionaires. He went straight to #1 in the polls of Republican voters. Up to 30,000 boisterous supporters started showing up to his rallies. TV ate it up. He became addicted to the way people responded to him, so his presidential campaign only continued on: Trump fell in love with himself all over again, and he soon forgot his mission to get a good deal for a TV show. Trump never expected to become the leader of the GOP, but after winning the New Jersey primary, Moore believes that Trump s thoughts were something like,  I m actually going to be the Republican nominee   and my rich beautiful life is f#*@ing over!  Upon realizing that he wanted nothing to do with actually leading the country, Trump has been on self-destruction mode with controversy after controversy over the past few weeks. By this past weekend, the look on his face said it all    I hate this! I want my show back!  But it was too late. He was damaged goods, his brand beyond repair, a worldwide laughing stock and worse, a soon-to-be loser. Many now are sensing the end game here because they know Trump seriously doesn t want to do the actual job   and, most importantly, he cannot and WILL NOT suffer through being officially and legally declared a loser   LOSER!   on the night of November 8th. The fact that Trump has been self-sabotaging is a theory that is being touted more and more now that Trump s behavior becomes even more erratic. Moore s insight definitely makes sense here.

He just didn t have enough time to form the couple of extra words, like  since 9/11. I m not there to give a major 45-minute policy address,  he said of his Trump introduction Monday in Youngstown, Ohio, where he said plainly that  under those eight years, before Obama came along, we didn t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack inside the United States. You speak in somewhat abbreviated language,  Giuliani told The News Tuesday.  All human beings speak in abbreviated language at times. Source: New York Daily NewsEven this short video clip is a minute and 20 seconds long. He had plenty of time to talk about everything but 9/11.The idea that  all (terrorist attacks) started once Clinton and Obama came to office  is both false and offensive. The deadliest terrorist attack happened when Giuliani was in office, and many speculate that things would not have been so bad, especially for the first responders, under a different mayor.More than that, this is a dangerous lie. As of 2014, 3,158 people have died from terrorist attacks within the United States. Over 2,900 of those people died during the attacks of 9/11. Even with the addition of the San Bernardino shooting, far fewer than 100 people have died from terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, at least since Obama took office.Whether or not Giuliani actually forgot 9/11 is irrelevant. Donald Trump is trying to create an environment in which no one is held accountable for their words, and Giuliani is no exception. The new way of campaigning, at least for Trump s team, is to spit out ridiculous accusations and assertions and then blame the media for directly quoting them. Giuliani says he will slip up again, as we all will, but since he s on the Trump team, don t look for any sort of contrition. Look for doubling down and more lies.Featured image via Jeff Swensen at Getty Images. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This Trump supporter literally said the GOP has rigged elections and that is supposed to prove that Hillary Clinton has rigged the 2016 Election.Roger Stone is one of Trump s biggest supporters and in defense of the Republican nominee s assertion that the 2016 Election is  rigged  in favor of Hillary he wrote a column for The Hill in an attempt to demonstrate that Trump is right to be concerned. Not only did it go badly, but the Republican Party must be totally pissed off about it.That s because Stone claimed that Wisconsin Republicans, under Reince Priebus s leadership, were successful at rigging five elections in the state to make sure things went their way. As someone with great sentimental attachment to the Republican Party, as I joined as the party of Goldwater, both parties have engaged in voting machine manipulation,  Stone claimed before naming names.  Nowhere in the country has this been more true than Wisconsin, where there are strong indications that Scott Walker and the Reince Priebus machine rigged as many as five elections including the defeat of a Walker recall election. Stone even accused Priebus of orchestrating Ted Cruz s victory over Trump in Wisconsin earlier this year:When the Trump vs. Cruz primary took place, the same pattern emerged again of a Marquette University poll showing a 20 point shift from Trump ahead by 10% to Trump behind by 10%, which was simply absurd. Shifts like that don t happen over brief intervals of time, absent a nuclear explosion. It didn t make any sense   unless you knew what was going on was an  instant replay  of Walker s victories. The machine Priebus built was delivering for Cruz big time.In short, Trump s longtime ally just tried to prove that Hillary could rig the election by accusing Republicans of rigging five elections and a primary in Wisconsin.Of course, this doesn t prove Trump s accusation against Hillary. What it does do, however, is call into question the trustworthiness of Republicans. If Reince Priebus is capable of rigging elections in Wisconsin to the point where Republicans can win five of them he is definitely capable of rigging a national election to make sure Republicans gain absolute power even though all of the polls indicate that Trump is losing this election badly.Trump own man just kneecapped the GOP nominee s own claims by shifting the election rigging accusation to Republicans.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Hillary Clinton wants to be America s Angela Merkel and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany,  Trump said.  Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe. Trump s claims baffled Germany s European Affairs Minister Michael Roth in particular because, as usual, Trump is lying in an effort to scare Americans into voting for him.In remarks made to Reuters, Roth apologized for Trump s made up claims and took on the task of cleaning up his mess by informing him of what is actually going on in Germany. I m sorry that the Republican presidential candidate trumpets out things like that without any factual basis,  Roth said.  If he had studied the actual situation in Germany, he would know that, while the many refugees who came to Germany and Europe pose a big challenge for us, and everything is still not completely resolved, they have not led to a massive increase in crime rates. Indeed, statistics show that the number of crimes committed in Germany are virtually unchanged from 2015, which means crime rates are NOT increasing due to the increased number of immigrants.According to Reuters:Statistics compiled by the German Interior Ministry showed the number of crimes reported in 2015   excluding visa violations and other immigration violations   remained essentially unchanged from the previous year at 5.9 million.Once again, Trump embarrassed himself and America by spouting falsehoods about another nation. Roth should not have to comment on bullshit like this but he is forced to do so because American conservatives hate facts and would rather lie to win elections.In addition, comparing Hillary to Angela Merkel is a high compliment since Merkel is a powerful and successful female head of state who has turned Germany into an economic powerhouse that is 20 years away from becoming 100 percent energy independent.If Hillary Clinton is anything like Merkel America can expect to achieve great heights in the years ahead.Featured image via Jeff Swensen/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

To make matters worse, Mike Pence compared Trump s foreign policy ideas to Reagan, and that was just too much for young Ron Reagan.He let loose on Pence, Trump, the entire campaign, and the GOP in an interview on MSNBC. He first addressed Pence s ridiculous assertion that Trump s foreign policy is anything like Ronald Reagan s 1979 campaign s  broad-shouldered approach : One thing he left out, I suppose, is that my father wasn t pathological. My father would ve been humiliated and embarrassed by what has happened to his party, the Republican Party, and would be humiliated and embarrassed that they have nominated somebody like Donald Trump to be president of the United States. As bad as St. Ronnie was, at least he carried some credibility. Trump has no credibility   how can he when every word out of his mouth is a lie, and when he changes his opinions as often as anyone with a shred of personal hygiene changes their underwear? Ron touched on that, too, when he launched into his full-scale attack: Trump should not be in this race. He s an absurdity. He s a travesty. And that is the reality here. I know it s difficult for journalists to deal with this. We re used to covering presidential races where we grant credibility to both sides, but that is not the case this time Donald Trump is not [a credible candidate]. I had the dubious pleasure of reading the transcript of his speech today. It s full of the usual empty jargon. This is a man who knows nothing about the world and cannot be president of the United States. Ron went on by saying that a President Trump will be a national emergency because of his severe inexperience with the world, and his inability to learn, well, pretty much anything. Watch his full comments below, via MSNBC:Trump s foreign policy ideas are so insane that Republican foreign policy experts are saying his plans will badly undermine the U.S.   something Trump himself will never acknowledge. For instance, he wants to beat China into submission on trade, but his ideas are more likely to  wreck our country s credibility, economy, and leadership in very short order,  particularly in Asia.That s the opposite of what Trump keeps peddling, but that s where Ron s statements come into play. Trump is an absurdity; a carnival sideshow, or a silly, outlandish cartoon. Despite the GOP s attempts to turn him into a serious candidate, he s continued down his own path and virtually cost himself the election already, and it s only August.St. Reagan might be responsible for a lot of our current ills, but even he could actually run things.

Whether or not these immigrants support gender equality, gay rights, religious freedom and the rule of American law.The irony is rich   a man who has no respect for gender equality, gay rights, religious freedom or the rule of law is going to ask hardworking immigrants if they support the things he does not. Maybe it s a catch 22   perhaps if the immigrants answer  YES  to any of the following a Trump Administration would deny them entry.Suppose an immigrant comes through and is asked if he or she does not support gay rights. Like many Christians in this country, many Muslims or Catholics from South America do not support same-sex marriage. If a Muslim or a South American Catholic answer that they do not support same-sex marriage, would a Trump Administration brand them, ultimately, as anti-gay?Remember, Donald Trump doesn t support same-sex marriage.In other words, he himself would most likely fail his own immigration test.Trump s senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, told the Associated Press that the aim of the new litmus test was to selectively determine who our  friends  are and which immigrants would best be equipped to fight against  radical Islamic terrorism.  So there it is   this isn t a test on all immigrants; it s really a test on Muslims cleverly disguised as a legitimate part of immigration customs.I guess that whole adhering to religious freedom thing doesn t ring true for Trump or his lily white allies.

At some point I ll be so presidential that you people will be so bored, and I ll come back as a presidential person, and instead of 10,000 people I ll have about 150 people and they ll say, boy, he really looks presidential,  he said in April. And then they ended with an ultimatum: If [his supporters] can t get Mr. Trump to change his act by Labor Day, the GOP will have no choice but to write off the nominee as hopeless and focus on salvaging the Senate and House and other down-ballot races. As for Mr. Trump, he needs to stop blaming everyone else and decide if he wants to behave like someone who wants to be President or turn the nomination over to Mike Pence.

No candidate has been in this position, at this point in an election cycle, in the modern polling era, and gone on to win the November election.

And I am feeling, to a certain extent, that we are reaping the whirlwind at that. And I have to look in the mirror and ask myself,  To what extent did I contribute? Indeed, conservative now look upon trusted mainstream media outlets such as NBC and the New York Times as their enemies simply because they report facts. This has led to the rise of conservative outlets such as Fox News, which often twists facts or lies outright to make their viewers angry in an effort to steer them toward a certain political viewpoint. And that is precisely why Fox has been called the propaganda arm of the GOP.But all of that demonizing of facts and the mainstream media outlets that report them has created the political climate in which con men like Donald Trump are thriving. In fact, Trump s supporters love lies so much that they didn t even notice or care when Trump told them to their faces that he has been lying to them.American democracy could be irrevocably harmed by right-wing hucksters who seriously believe the mainstream media has a liberal bias. The problem is that facts are not bipartisan. Something is either a fact or it isn t. And just because the facts are not on the side of conservatives and their bullshit policies and ideas that does not give them the right to demonize them for their own gain. That s how we end up with paranoid idiots like Trump getting this close to becoming president. And stupidity and paranoia are the last things America needs in the White House.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Bush, the Republican. By contrast, Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. marines on May 2, 2011 in a raid on his compound in Afghanistan that was ordered by President Barack Obama.The conservative movement has for years tried to argue that they are stronger against terrorism than Democrats, and as an outgrowth they have worked to down play Democratic successes in that fight. There has been an intense crackdown on terrorists during Obama s seven years as President, including rolling up on the al Qaeda network, ISIS, and other groups.Giuliani s statement is a blatant lie, but it has strong support with hardcore conservatives.Featured image via Twitter""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

HARD.A man who purports to be a dutiful Catholic, Hannity has made a career out of violating the ninth commandment (or eighth in his faith) against lying about others. If Hannity stopped vomiting up falsehoods, his program would be nothing but a test pattern. From him and the others in the  Who cares if it s false?  conservative media camp, we have heard over the decades that Hillary and Bill Clinton murdered many people, that the Bush administration found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, that Obama could be on the verge of declaring martial law, and on and on.They are pretend journalists pumping out propaganda to scared, foolish people.Eichenwald then took Hannity to task for telling his audience that Hillary may have had a seizure in a video which shows Clinton  Being pulled in different directions by multiple speakers at once, Clinton playfully acted like a bobblehead doll, smiling and then speaking after the joke was over. But Hannity characterized Clinton s playfulness as a serious medical condition, which Eichenwald did NOT appreciate.I know this response to Sean Hannity is a little raw, but as someone with epilepsy, I hope my editors will let this slip through: Fuck you, Sean. Your willingness to deceive your viewers to degrade those of us with epilepsy, to suggest something is a seizure when it looks nothing like one, to leave people dumber about this condition is unforgivable.It is rare for a mainstream journalist to use such strong language, but Hannity certainly deserved it. And that was only the beginning.Eichenwald went on to talk about what a real seizure is, explaining: People do not smile during a seizure while standing upright and then immediately launch into a coherent sentence. There s no smiling because, if for some reason the person experiencing the seizure has not collapsed to the ground in unconsciousness, the moment the body begins to move uncontrollably is terrifying. After a seizure, someone does not instantly jump back into a conversation, making jokes. Eichenwald then delivered the final blow.While I know you almost never apologize for anything you do on the air, this sin requires some penance. It can be done in secret if you don t have the character to make a public pronouncement of regret. Write a check. Make a donation to help those you demeaned and damaged if you are unable to show the backbone to undo the damage you have done, you can understand why I say you  purport  to be a Catholic. If you really were one, you d be worried about burning in hell for what you ve done.Thus far, Sean Hannity has not responded nor has he thrown a temper tantrum over Eichenwald basically putting him over his knee and giving his an ass-whipping.

While it is not legally required for presidential candidates to release those documents, it has been tradition for them to do so in the interest of transparency for the electorate. However, Trump refuses. He uses being audited as an excuse, but that makes no sense since all of the returns from previous years are not being audited, and, even if they were, that would not prevent him from releasing them. Trump isn t releasing his taxes because there is something in there that he doesn t want us all to see. It s as simple as that.Well, GOP Rep. Steve King made an appearance on MSNBC s Morning Joe on Monday morning, and of course, Trump s tax returns became a topic of conversation. Rep. King says of the matter: I just think the window for that has passed. When he said that he wouldn t release his returns till the audit was over, and he d been being audited for 13 years, I d say that for him to release them is just a forgone conclusion. Donald Trump will not release his tax returns. King added: If he drops it now, into this presidential intense sprint around to the final turn part of the race, I think that would be the only discussion we would hear all the way until November. Well, Rep. King, they ll be talking about it anyway. Trump should release his returns so that people can see that he has nothing to hide. You re right in saying that it is way past time for him to release these tax documents, and you re likely right that he won t do it, because there s probably some very damning things in there that would hurt his candidacy even more than the heat he is taking for refusing to release.Watch Rep.

Of course, this means the polls are rigged, or at least biased, right? Right. So Breitbart, being of sound editorial judgment, commissioned Gravis to conduct their own poll. The results?Hillary leads Trump 42 percent to 37 percent.That s in a four-way race, not a two-way. The poll surveyed 2,832 people on August 9, and carries a 1.8 percent margin of error. So Hillary is outside of even that.Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief at Breitbart, has this to say about their poll: It s an open secret that polls are often manipulated and spun to create momentum for a particular candidate or issue. Breitbart News Network s first national poll marks the start of a major initiative to give our readers an accurate assessment on where the American people stand on the key topics and people of the day   without the mainstream media filter. It s pretty telling when the poll you conducted, with the intent of being as neutral as possible, brings back the same results as the polls you think are biased. This poll has Hillary leading Trump by five percent. In a four-way race, Reuters/Ipsos  most recent poll likewise has Hillary leading by five points, Economist/YouGov has her up by six points, and even Rasmussen Reports has her up by three points.But Trump s crowds are huge and Hillary s aren t, so of course the polls are screwy. Breitbart and Gravis are trying to put a positive spin on it, though, saying that the poll reveals areas where Trump can reach more voters. For some reason, Doug Kaplan, managing partner at Gravis, thinks things like 11 percent support for Trump from the black community presents a problem for Hillary. His rationale seems to be based only on the fact that Hillary has less support from the black community than Obama did in 2012.Hillary also won big when it came to the question,  Do you agree or disagree? Donald Trump/Hillary Clinton would fight for people like me.  Overall, only 39 percent feel that Hillary would fight for them, and Trump had 38 percent of that. However, when it came to Muslims, a stunning 84 percent said they think she ll fight for them.Obviously, Trump won t have that kind of support from the Muslim community. Not with his Islamophobic remarks toward them.Overall, Breitbart walked away from this with egg on their face, because they sought to prove one thing and failed miserably. In the end, all they showed is that either Gravis is biased, too, or that (gasp!) the polls are more accurate than the right would like to believe.Photo of Hillary by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.

She was eclipsed by the imploding star that is Donald Trump, the owner of what you might describe as a  resting rich face,  Oliver said.You see, Trump tried to briefly act sane by reading his speech material off of a teleprompter, which the right-wing hypocritically whines about President Obama doing, so he can t go off script and say stupid things. This was the 53rd consecutive week he was going to put his campaign back on track,  Oliver quipped.But no sooner had Trump started doing that when he started calling for  Second Amendment people  to do something about Hillary, claimed the the election is rigged, and declared that President Obama literally  founded ISIS. Wow,  Oliver remarked.  Now clearly what he just said is absolutely absurd, but even when people try to help him reframe it, he doubled down. Indeed, during an interview with right-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt he doubled down on his accusation despite being given an opportunity to walk his statements back, only to then claim that he was merely being  sarcastic  when he repeatedly called the sitting President of the United States the leader of a terrorist organization. He s so insistent!  Oliver continued.  He s like the guy drowning but waving off a lifeboat saying,  Get out of here, I m very buoyant. I m the most buoyant. Everybody talks about my buoyancy. I m a tremendous floater.  And yes,  sarcasm  is a bullshit excuse. It s the douchebag s apology. After incredulously noting that Trump walked back his  bullshit excuse,  Oliver then took on Trump s dangerous charge that Hillary will only win the election because it is  rigged. What is really worth taking note of there, and is worth thinking about, is that he s suggesting the election may be stolen by his opponent, and that s actually dangerous. He is priming his supporters to question the result when he loses Pennsylvania, as polls indicate he will, and as all Republican presidential candidates have since 1988. In fact, Trump actually urged police officers who support him to patrol polling places to make sure voters don t vote multiple times. In short, Trump supporters are primed to intimidate minority voters on Election Day, because as we all know, conservatives believe minority voters cheat the system. But Oliver pointed out how Americans will know if Trump somehow wins the election. In a way, we are all Trump Election Day observers. Because if you look out of your window in November and see the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse you ll know, oh shit, they just called Florida! Oliver then explained that his team signed up as an  election observer  on Trump s website to see what would happen and they got an email declaring that  we are going to do everything we are legally allowed to do to stop crooked Hillary from rigging this election.  And that prompted Oliver to question if Trump knows what is legal and what is not since his own lawyer once claimed that spousal rape isn t real. Plus, again, Trump suggested that gun nuts assassinate Hillary Clinton.Here s the video via VidMe.Donald Trump is a con man who is trying to become the most powerful person on the face of the planet.

People Magazine is reporting that  daddy s little girl  and Putin s likely lady friend, alleged Chinese spy Wendi Deng Murdoch (yes, she was also married to Fox News overlord Rupert Murdoch), were spotted over the weekend enjoying scenic Dubrovnik, Croatia, in Eastern Europe.Sight seeing with @wendimurdoch in DubrovnikA photo posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Aug 14, 2016 at 8:04am PDTFor years, rumors swirled that Murdoch s ex and Trump s pal Putin were dating   ever since the two elites divorced their wives in 2013 and 2014. The Kremlin has not confirmed nor denied the relationship, and Deng flat-out denied the accusations last month, years after they became public, but anonymous sources within the Kremlin confirmed the  serious  relationship. Via US Weekly:Reports of the pair have been floating around for years, ever since their respective divorces in 2014 and 2013.One insider close to the powerful leader tells Us Weekly the relationship is  serious. But given Trump s decision to practically hump Putin s leg and his (and his current campaign chair s) confirmed financial ties to Putin and his allies, it would be a wise decision for Ivanka Trump to avoid even the appearance of impropriety because of her heavy involvement in daddy s campaign. Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,  Trump s son, Donald Jr., told a real estate conference in 2008, the Washington Post reports.  We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. Trump s reliance on Russian money to turn anything resembling a profit may explain why he repeatedly praises the Russian leader, even denying that he invaded the Ukraine despite reality proving him wrong in a 10-second Google search. The Post explains Trump s relationship with Putin:The dynamic illustrates the extent to which Trump s worldview has been formed through the lens of commerce rather than the think tanks, government deliberations and international diplomatic conferences that typically shape the foreign policy positions of presidential candidates.It also reflects Trump s willingness to see world leaders through his own personal connections. In a Republican Party in which an ability to stand up to Putin has been seen as a test of toughness, Trump s relationship with the Russian leader is instead one of mutual flattery. Putin said in December that Trump was a  colorful and talented  person, a compliment that Trump said at the time was an  honor. The back-and-forth has continued. In a mid-June rally, Trump cited those comments as the reason he will not reject the Russian leader.  A guy calls me a genius, and I m going to renounce?  Trump said.  I m not going to renounce him.  The next day in St. Petersburg, Putin again called Trump a  colorful person  and said he welcomed Trump s proposal for a  full-scale resumption  of U.S.-Russia ties.On the campaign trail, Trump has called for a new partnership with Moscow, overhauling NATO, the allied military force seen as the chief protector of pro-Western nations near Russia. And Trump has surrounded himself with a team of advisers who have had financial ties to Russia.If the numerous reports regarding a down-low Putin/Murdoch relationship are true, and it seems they are, this could create gigantic problems for Trump as he continues his routine of supporting Russia in all things. After all, a discreet vacation in Croatia would be a great time to discuss bigger plans  like Trump s call on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton for him.If Deng s weak response years after the relationship was rumored to have begun and only after it began to get more press is true, if she has  never met  Putin as she says   well, to use Trump s words,  some people say Featured image via People Magazine/The Guardian""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Based on everything I ve seen,  Stachowiak says,  the officer act properly  because the suspect was running away, clearly not a threat even if he had a gun in his possession.  If he didn t want to get shot,  he says,  he should have stopped. The actions of the Black Lives Matter in the black community in Wisconsin had proven once again that Black Lives Matter is not just a hate group, but a domestic terrorist organization,  Stachowiak continues, calling the social justice group  a bunch of animals  before backtracking and limiting his  animal  claim to  looters  he says are affiliated with Black Lives Matter. He continued, accusing Hillary Clinton and  you, Barack Obama  of embracing  a terrorist organization    you know, kind of like how Trump has embraced the Ku Klux Klan, but without the actual terrorist organization.Stachowiak says that the homes of Black Lives Matter leaders should be burned to the ground   as should any  looters,  real or imaginary (let s face it: he just wants to kill him some  n*ggers,  as he has oh-so-politely said in the past). He also had something to say about black people who take advantage of the chaos to steal from stores   especially the women and children: I don t care if they re women an children, anyone coming out of a store [he raises his gun and points it menacingly at the camera] should be shot on site. They should be shot exiting the store. If they make it down the street shoot them in the back. What the f*ck kind of coward wants to shoot women and children in the back? What sort of degenerate would even suggest such a thing? This guy. This guy right here. I got a round with your name on it,  Stachowiak says, producing a bullet with  BLM  written in marker.  Try to burn my home. Try to burn my business and I guarantee you ll never make it out of the driveway because I ll drop you like it s hot. Neither arson, nor attempted arson, is a crime that would make one eligible for the death penalty in any state.Stachowiak continued his unhinged rant with an explanation that  Black Lives Matter are working with the Muslim Brotherhood.  According to the master detective, the Muslim Brotherhood is supplying weapons to  radical black Americans. After condemning the Mayor, the National guard, and police for failing to sharpie up their bullets and shoot black men, women, and children they suspected of looting  in the face  without a trial. His solution, of course, is to  light up the front of the store  whenever a looting is suspected and mow everyone who comes out down in the street. But Jim, there might be a 12-year old girl or a 8-year old boy,  he says sarcastically.  It s called collateral damage. Children are  collateral damage.  Yes, he really said that.Stachowiak says that Michael Brown  got the justice he deserved  after Officer Darren Wilson accused him of jaywalking, and warned the Justice Department that things are going to get  much worse  if they don t start shooting black people who might or might not be protesting or rioting on sight. If this lack of face-shooting persists, he says he will gather his  Veteran friends to do some hunting. Turning to show the back of his t-shirt, which reads  Black Lives Matter are domestic terrorists,  he said: Black Lives Matter is a domestic terrorist organization. And the way my friends that are Iraq and Afghan veterans, some of which are schnipers [sic], the way they dealt with terrorists on the battlefield is the way we need to deal with Black Lives Matter in the streets of America.Watch the video below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtSGY3b9mqwFeatured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Host Chris Wallace hammered him about Trump s assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton  founded ISIS,  backing him into a corner and making him squirm. Ultimately, Wallace came to the conclusion that Pence is nothing more than Trump s  clean up crew. You and he spent a day defending his remarks, saying that they were serious,  Wallace began, playing the video.  Now, Trump says that he was being sarcastic. So, Governor, which is it? Well, I think he was being very serious, and he was making a point that needs to be made, that there is no question that the failed policies of President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in the wider Middle East, created a vacuum within Iraq in which ISIS was able to arise,  Pence replied. So then why is he saying he was sarcastic?,  Wallace asked insistently. Well, he was making a very serious point, and look ,  Pence responded,Wallace was not about to let Pence off the hook and asked again,  Forgive me, why did he say he was being sarcastic? Well, he was making a very serious point. Donald Trump has a way of talking to get people s attention, and it s drawn attention to a very important issue,  Pence replied. There was a time when any Democrat president knew where the buck stopped in the White House,  Pence continued.  And the responsibility for the failed policies in the Middle East that created the environment where ISIS developed belongs to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the American people know that. Governor, those are all perfectly legitimate points to make, but that isn t what Trump said. He said that Obama and Clinton were the most valuable players of ISIS, that they were the co-founders of ISIS,  Wallace said.  Then he said, well, I was just being sarcastic about that, just as he said he was just being sarcastic about inviting Russia to come in and release e-mails of Hillary Clinton s. Isn t the sarcastic excuse getting a bit old?,  Wallace asked directly. Well, no, I don t think it s getting old at all, Chris,  Pence stammered.  Donald Trump made his way through a very competitive primary because he spoke not like your typical politician, but just plainly like an everyday American. And speaking plainly is exactly what the American people will anticipate in the course of this election, but more importantly, they re going to have a president who tells them exactly what s on his mind, and the American people are going to hear and hear him loudly. Finally, after pinning Pence down and listening to the steady stream of bullshit the VP was feeding him, Wallace said screw it and asked the former Indiana governor the only question left: Are you the cleanup crew?

Yet, cue the denial and excuses from Pierson, who replied: This really has become much of a novelty in presidential campaigns. A novelty?! Even a Fox News host couldn t let Pierson get away with such a ludicrous statement as that. All candidates have been releasing their returns, no matter the party. Trump not releasing his returns is clearly indicative that he has something in which he is trying to prevent the public from seeing.Pierson keeps going back and forth with Neville even trying to say that the media is bullying poor tiny-handed Trump into releasing his returns. However, the Fox host wasn t having it, and told her: Katrina, we re going to keep going on this because people want to know. It s not about a gotcha with Mr. Trump.

Why are you saying that it s some sort of corruption or some sort of campaign that people are   including the media   are out to get him? That is not the case. He s running for the president of the United States of America. Show your tax returns. It s that simple. And BOOM went the dynamite. Well done, Neville.

Hannity has been the leading propagator of the claim. Hannity had the cojones to claim that evidence for his allegations was provided by an Associated Press reporter named Lisa Lerer.Lerer called Hannity out on his fictitious claims, definitively proving that Clinton is not, in fact, suffering from seizures and that Hannity had made the whole story up.

Gutierrez says of Clinton during an interview on CNN s State of the Union: I think   Hillary Clinton is the best for the country. I m not thinking about it as a Republican.

Donald Trump is not good for the country; in fact, he is downright dangerous for both the nation and the world, and there s no way they don t know this.

I don t want to live in a society that Donald Trump will create. After slamming Trump, Gutierrez went on to say of Clinton: I think she d make a darn good president.

Manafort attempted to excuse Trump s comment earlier this week regarding Hillary Clinton. During a campaign event in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump suggested that should Clinton be elected, it might be up to  Second Amendment people  to take matters into their own hands and stop her before she gets rid of the Second Amendment. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the Second Amendment people maybe there is, I don t know,  Trump said on Tuesday.Since then, Trump and his campaign have received a significant blowback from the comments. Trump and Manafort have blamed the matter on the media, insisting they are twisting Trump s words. Those claims are repeated during the segment. Host Jake Tapper said to Manafort: Here s the thing, it wasn t just reporters. It was Republicans, it was people in Washington, D.C. who want Mr. Trump to win. At that point, Tapper proves his point by finding one of the Trump supporters who was in attendance at the event. The Trump fan says that he was  aghast  by Trump s remark. The point is most people did not interpret it that way. It was not at all meant to be a threat. But the point again is you could have covered what he was saying or you could try and take an aside and take the Clinton narrative and play it out. You chose to do that instead. Then Manafort lists some recent news stories that reflect poorly on Clinton, claiming that Tapper only covers negative news stories about Trump and positive stories about Clinton. As a factual matter, on Monday, my show covered Mr. Trump s speech. Okay? We did. We covered Mr. Trump s speech. And we did cover those Hillary Clinton emails,  tapper retorts.

Trump began this narrative last week in Ohio where he said that he is  afraid the election is going to be rigged. We re going to watch Pennsylvania. Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don t come in and vote five times,  Trump said at a rally in Altoona, Pennsylvania Friday.  If you do that, we re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion   I really mean this, Pennsylvania   is if cheating goes on. That claim was made despite the fact that Hillary Clinton has maintained a very comfortable lead over Trump in the polls.Since then, Trump has doubled down on his claims that the election will be stolen from him in Pennsylvania. Trump s campaign has gone so far as to try and recruit supporters to act as election observers. Normally, recruiting election overseers wouldn t be too out of the ordinary for a campaign to do. However, traditionally campaigns hire or recruit people with a legal background to do the work. Trump s campaign is calling for anyone and everyone to answer his call to action. We have to call up law enforcement, and we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching,  Trump said on Friday.Calling in an army of your supporters, who will likely have no legal background, to hang out at the polls with a battalion of armed police officers sounds far more like voter intimidation than a move towards ensuring protecting voter s rights. Given the scenes of carnage that have come out of Trump s rallies, this move is almost sure to set up Pennsylvania s polling locations as the backdrops to a few riots. I am going to go ahead and predict that should events unfold that way; it ll be areas with minority populations that are targeted.Trump cannot give any evidence as to why there will be election fraud in Pennsylvania. How could there be? The election hasn t even occurred yet. He is spouting unfounded nonsense because he is desperate. Like a wounded animal trapped in a corner, Trump is flailing.

That s always the pattern in the word of God. The kings were all males, when you had a departure from that with Jezebel and Athaliah, it was not a good thing, it did not work out well. Leadership in the church is reserved for men, leadership in the home is reserved for men. In other words, in God s economy, he has designed leadership and authority in society and in the church and in the home to be exercised by men.I think you could make a good case that leadership in culture, society, politically as well as in the home, that that is something in God s economy that s reserved for men. What if somebody had the courage to go on national TV, somebody of some kind of prominence or visibility, and said,  Look, I m going to vote for Trump because he s a man. I don t believe that women should be entrusted with high political office    That s the position I happen to take. Here s the video via Right Wing Watch:Of course, Fischer merely cherry-picked two examples of female leadership in the Bible while blatantly ignoring all the other examples of female leadership.What follows is a list of female leaders in the Bible as put together by religioustolerance.org:Exodus 15:24: Miriam, the daughter of Aaron was a prophet and one of the triad of leaders of Israel during the Exodus from Egypt.Judges 4 & 5: Deborah, a prophet-judge, headed the army of ancient Israel.2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chronicles 34:22 Huldah, a prophet, verified the authenticity of the  Book of the Law of the Lord given through Moses    the Book of Deuteronomy. She triggered a religious renewal.Acts 21:8: Philip the evangelist had four unmarried daughters who were prophets.Romans 16:1: Paul refers to Phoebe as a minister or deacon of the church at Cenchrea.The Gospel of Philip, was widely used among early Christian congregations. It portrayed Mary Magdalene as the companion of Jesus, in a position of very high authority within the early Christian movement.The Gospel of Mary described Mary Magdalene as a leader of Jesus  disciples. She delivering a passionate sermon to the disciples after his resurrection. This raised their spirits and inspired them to start evangelizing the known world.In short, Fischer apparently has never actually read the Bible. It s either that or he only reads the parts he agrees with.And he is not the only conservative  Christian  who wants to place women under the boot heel of men.The Christian right-wing s favorite fake historian David Barton called for stripping women of the right to vote two years ago. And a more recent example would be conservative  Christian  pastor Steven Anderson who called for women to not only be banned from voting but also called for confining them solely to the home.Opinions like these are the reason why women need to band together and put a woman in the White House this November. Conservatives need to be put in their place for their extremist views and that place is definitely not in a position of leadership, but in the fringes where they can never hurt anyone again.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Such is the case with Trump s running mate, Mike Pence. He s a religious nut, as evidenced by the discriminatory  religious freedom law  he helped pass in Indiana, which specifically targeted the LGBT community. But, as bad as that is, it s not the most insane thing he s ever said or done.During a 2002 interview with Wolf Blitzer, Pence discussed his opinion of then-Secretary of State Colin Powell s call for better education and protection against STDs, particularly in the form of condoms. For Pence, who once advocated for prayer to stop an HIV outbreak, rather than a clean needle exchange, saying that condoms can help protect against STDs was just too much.He spouted this absurdity in response: Well, I just simply believe the only truly safe sex, Wolf, as the president believes, is no sex. And we ought to, with leaders of the stature of the secretary of state, we ought to be sending a message to kids across the country and the opportunity had across the world that abstinence is the best choice for young people. But let s be clear, last year, the National Institute of Health, Wolf, and some 28 separate experts said at least a half dozen to ten sexually transmitted diseases for which condom use has zero preventative value. The secretary of state is simply wrong.The problem is it was too modern of an answer, Wolf. It was   it truly was a modern, liberal answer to a problem that parents like me are facing all over America, and frankly, all over the world. Yes, condoms are too modern and too liberal for an abstinence-only nutbag like then-Congressman, now-VP candidate Mike Effing Pence. Everything everyone s parents ever said about condoms, everything every sex-ed program has ever said, even everything the CDC has said, is wrong. Pence knows things.This is the man who wanted to redefine rape so that federal funds would only pay for abortions in the instance of  forcible rape.  That s the same thing as the infamous Todd Akin s  legitimate rape  comment. Pence is known as a pioneer in the fight against Planned Parenthood, and has signed multiple bills limiting abortion access in his state of Indiana.Pence is also the man that said working mothers stunt their children s emotional growth, and who diverted $3.5 million from the state s TANF fund to pay an anti-abortion group known for lying to, well, lie to Indiana s women about abortion.So, while it seems silly to bring up something he said as a congressman 14 years ago, it s also frighteningly relevant to who and what he d be as vice president, because he s still that man. It wouldn t be surprising to hear him say that he and Trump will seek to ban sex-education (if not condoms themselves) in favor of telling girls just to keep an aspirin between their knees is they don t want to get pregnant, or an STD.Featured image by Sara D.

The point of the prank is to test the supporter s loyalty to their chosen candidate.  We decided to assemble a group of them for an unfiltered view at how they connect with Trump s vision for America,  as Triumph the Insult Comedy Dog puts it.The phony ads they watch are rather extreme bizarre even. During the ad, a Trump impersonator says that they will build a giant electrified fence as a temporary way to keep  any illegals  out while they construct the real wall that Trump has promised to build if he is elected president.The people in the focus group also watch an ad where Trump calls out Hillary Clinton, demanding that she reveal to the world that she is a man pretending to be a woman.Another ad features Trump s solution to helping women feel more secure in bathrooms. Rather than banning transgender individuals from using the restroom, Trump will provide every woman who uses a public bathroom with a firearm.Spoiler alert: The Trump supporters totally fall for the gag, believing they are real. Now, it is important to keep in mind that research has shown that people tend to offer opinions about subjects that are ridiculous.

It s called Zip, and its developer claims its data is more accurate than that of any poll because it s not a poll, it s a conversation. It s also 100 percent anonymous so people feel more like telling the truth.Zip has Trump leading 64 percent to Hillary s 36 percent. Most of the traditional polls have Hillary leading Trump by anywhere from four to ten points right now. Why the difference?Ric Milliti, Zip s developer, says his app poses questions on a daily basis and then averages the answers of 100,000 users. He believes that the nature of his app means he gets a far purer result than the traditional polls: We re not a poll. We re a conversation, and 100% anonymous. People feel comfortable answering questions without fear of being bullied or being called a racist. People can express themselves safely, and you get a pure answer. Look at some of the questions, though: New polls suggest Trump is getting crushed by Clinton. Do they reflect how you are going to vote? That s the question that puts Trump ahead of Hillary by a full 28 points. California, who you voting for? For this one, Trump got 55%, compared to 45% for Hillary (the latest poll from Public Policy Polling has Hillary leading Trump by 16 percent in that state). What do you honestly think Trump meant by saying  The 2nd amendment people can do something about Hillary?' 63 percent said Trump simply meant  vote against her,  while 37 percent said he meant,  assassinate her. This is only slightly more sophisticated than taking a poll from your own social media account. Milliti knows very little about the people who are answering these questions, but thinks this is the wave of the future for accurate polling.According to an article on Windows Central, the results of all the polls that take place within the app  may not be the most scientific.  Well, duh. Milliti simply takes a cross-section of users by age, gender, and geographical location to get his results, which is nothing like enough to make a poll scientific. That s something Milliti would know if he knew anything about polling. He might be great at developing apps, but his skill ends there for right now.Despite that, Trump supporters will still glom onto this the way they re glomming onto a poll published by the Arizona Freedom Alliance that claims that its poll is far more accurate than the traditional polls. After all, Trump has squillions of Twitter followers and draws thousands to his rallies, so there s no way he s actually trailing Hillary, right?The funny thing about the poll that the AFA republished, though, is that the  pollsters  merely called 1,000 people in each state, and never published their questions or the methodology they used to try and ensure they had representative samples of residents in each state. They seem to think:  It s 50,000 people, how can it possibly be less accurate than polls that only question 600 to 1,000 people? Milliti insists that most media polls are wildly inaccurate, and his polls are not. His polls, however, could easily be getting flooded with Trump fans who are desperate to see Trump ahead somewhere. Whether Milliti himself is a Trump supporter or not, he clearly lives in the same bubble that everyone else who claims the scientific polls are dishonest and inaccurate live in.Photo of Donald Trump by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images.

The man complained about McGovern s sexual harassment to the police, and the parish, in true Catholic fashion, fired him.Vince Vinaldi is a lawyer for the fired pool man, and he says of the situation: It s extremely disturbing that the person s who is head of this parish would be sending text with photographs of his exposed genitals.

Finaldi also says that the pool man approached McGovern about the explicit material that he was receiving, and also pointed out that Catholic priests are supposed to be completely celibate. The perverted priest simply responded, Oh, that just means that you re not married. Last I checked, celibacy in modern times refers to abstaining from sexual activity, not marriage.The Stockton Parish suspended McGovern once the allegations hit the news, and issued the usual generic statement regarding a supposed internal investigation: Today the Diocese of Stockton learned for the first time of employment related allegations against Monsignor Lawrence McGovern, the Pastor of Presentation Parish in Stockton. In accordance with the Canon Law of the Church, Bishop Stephen Blaire has placed Monsignor McGovern on administrative leave pending a full and complete investigation. Vince Finaldi, however, has a much more appropriate reaction than that of the local diocese: That person has no business being in a parish and head of a school where there are numerous young children walking around everyday. Unfortunately, Mr. Finaldi, if all of these pedophiles and other assorted perverts were to be dismissed as they should be, there would be very few priests left in the Catholic Church worldwide, and there s no way the Church would allow for that. Likely, McGovern will just be shuttled away to a different parish after the media storm dies down, free to sexually harass another day.Watch a news report on the developing situation, via local station Fox 40: Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Nevertheless, it s a jolting prospect now, with roughly three months still left before the Nov. 8 vote and weeks before the three presidential debates.Republicans who have devoted their professional lives to electing GOP candidates say they believe the White House already may be lost. They re exasperated by Trump s divisive politics and his insistence on running a general election campaign that mirrors his approach to the primaries.

Fagen is no moderate squish. She was a right-wing conservative member of the 2004 George W. Bush re-election campaign, and whatever the issues were with the morality of Bush s campaign that year   Iraq, terrorism, corruption, etc.   it is impossible to argue that it wasn t a well-run and well-organized campaign that beat out Senator John Kerry s effort that year.The Wall Street Journal described her role on that campaign as a  data whiz  and said she  helped perfect political micro-targeting. That is the technique used to target campaign prospects based on their interests and likelihood to be supporters of a candidate. The Bush 2004 campaign pioneered this, and it was used in a massive way by President Obama in his overwhelmingly successful 2008 and 2012 campaigns. It s how modern elections are won   or lost.Trump has not invested in campaign basics like that, and even in states where he should be on the ground with organizers that could give him a shot at winning, he isn t doing it. Instead, he is focused on feeding his base voters red meat, filled with bigotry, which turns off the voters he needs to win.And Republicans know it, and the veterans see the likelihood of a massive wipeout coming.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

President Obama took office in 2009 and inherited the War in Afghanistan.So if we go by Pierson s logic, that means George W.

It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Khan s) life,  she said.But again, George W.

The flag had a  Trump 2016  message on it.When asked by CNN why he displayed it, Brandon Partin explained that he bought the flag because they were being sold outside the rally and he thought Donald Trump would approve of it being flown at the rally.And then Partin defended the flag as  not racist  and suggested the Civil War was not fought because of racism and slavery. Most people in our country don t understand the full history behind the flag. So, I understand that the media and a lot of other people are going to turn it into something that it s not, you know, say that it s a racist thing or, you know, white supremacist. I am not a white supremacist. And it was about the North and the South. It wasn t about racism at all. The North had African-Americans fighting for them and the South had them for them, too. So for people who spin it in that direction is just completely false. I think that on a personal level between my beliefs and Trump s beliefs, I don t think he would have a problem with it at all because he probably understands the history and that s why we re all here. Here s the video via YouTube:First of all, the idea that slaves willingly fought for the Confederacy is ludicrous. The slave-holding Confederates feared giving firearms to slaves. Plus, slaves would have been forced to fight because they would not have freely fought for their own continued enslavement. Also, the Confederacy only approved of forcing blacks to fight for them on March 13, 1865 in an act of desperation. Lee surrendered on April 9, 1865. Partin is right that a very small percentage of black people in the South were soldiers in the Confederacy, but that s only because they were pressed into service by their tyrant masters and didn t want to be slaughtered for disobeying.Furthermore, the Civil War and the Confederate flag was all about slavery and racism. As evidence, in their Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, South Carolinians prominently cited slavery as the major cause of the decision to leave the Union and begin the process of seizing control of forts and other United States government property.A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that  Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,  and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction.This sectional combination for the submersion of the Constitution, has been aided in some of the States by elevating to citizenship, persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens; and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the South, and destructive of its beliefs and safety.In addition, Confederate Vice-President Alexander Stephens made it clear in his  Cornerstone Speech  that the Confederate government was founded on the belief that black people are an inferior race and that slavery is the cornerstone of the South. Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. In short, the Confederate flag waving morons are trying to re-write history to make the Confederacy look like it was this great paradise that the  evil  Union unjustly fought a war against in 1861-1865. The war of Northern aggression  some conservatives call it. Except that the South fired the first shots at Fort Sumter in an effort to forcibly seize US Government property.It s time for conservatives to face facts. The Confederate flag is racist. The Civil War was fought over slavery. And the Confederates were a bunch of traitors whose descendants are still whining about a war they lost and are now supporting Trump because they believe he ll help them revive the  cause,  which again is all about subjugation, hatred, and oppression of people who don t have white skin.Featured Image: Screenshot ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

So what do they do? Why, manufacture another Hillary Clinton scandal to distract from their recklessness.In a recent email dump, questions were raised (which were then inflamed by Donald Trump) regarding the idea that Clinton used her power as Secretary of State to influence her foundation. One email showed the foundation s executive, Doug Band, requesting a meeting between a wealthy donor and an ambassador, and asking for Clinton s aides to find a new job for an associate with the foundation.The completely generic and minuscule emails, which were part of thousands upon thousands released, were completely innocent. But that didn t stop the Republicans from labeling it as  pay for Play. Well the State Department has shut down those asinine, distracting talking points by pointing out that there is no evidence to suggest Clinton, in any way, used her power to accumulate favors for her foundation. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters:The State Department is not aware of any actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation. The Department does not believe it was inappropriate for Mr. Band or any other individual to recommend someone be considered for employment at the State Department. We also do not believe it s inappropriate for someone recommended in this manner to be potentially hired insofar as they meet the necessary qualifications for the job.The Clinton Foundation and the State Department made it clear that the individual that Band wanted hired (whose name was redacted) was not an employee of the foundation. And even if they were, Trudeau pointed out, that wouldn t necessarily be harbinger for employment, should they have the qualifications to be president.And the ambassador who wanted to meet with a donor? Such thing is commonplace:State Department officials are regularly in touch with a range of outside individuals and organizations, including non-profits, NGOs, think tanks and others.Even though such circumstances are commonplace and have historical precedence, Republicans are still hoping their phony, ill-conceived  scandal  will distract from the disaster that is their presidential candidate.Now Republicans are also toying with the idea she had a DNC staffer killed.

Before being tapped to the Vice Presidency, Truman was a United States Senator for 10 years and the elected presiding judge of Jackson County, Missouri for 8 years before that. Not only that, he wasn t a millionaire   he was a farmer, a haberdasher, and had deep connections to political mob bosses.Truman was no outsider. And Trump isn t an outsider.

We ve got an un-indicted felon as his opponent and you re talking about Khan, about him making a remark about this man,  Paladino, a former New York gubernatorial candidate, told interviewer Connell McShane on Imus in the Morning.  All right, I don t care if he s a Gold Star parent. He certainly doesn t deserve that title, OK, if he s as anti-American as he s illustrated in his speeches and in his discussion. I mean, if he s a member of the Muslim Brotherhood or supporting, you know, the ISIS-type of attitude against America, there s no reason for Donald Trump to have to honor this man. The Trump campaign s heartless attacks against the Khans have received widespread condemnation across America, with even some Trump supporters saying that the line was crossed in attacking the family. Trump himself belittled the family s sacrifices, pointing to his work as a real estate developer as comparable to losing a child. Trump also insinuated that Khan s wife didn t speak at the convention because of her Islamic faith.In subsequent comments she said she did not speak because she is still overwhelmed when speaking about how her child was lost.By comparison, the Khan family s sacrifice has been repeatedly praised by Hillary Clinton, her running mate Tim Kaine, and other Democrats.

Well, according to  Christian  conservatives, there are: the words  God  and  greatest,  especially together in a sentence   as was demonstrated by Christians at a California Catholic church throwing themselves into a panic when a group of three Muslim gentlemen shouted  Allahu Akbar! That phrase, sometimes shouted by religious terrorists who speak Arabic, simply means  God is the greatest. This or  Jesus is Lord  would be the exact thing shouted by some Christian extremists in America today. As an atheist, I personally find neither phrase alarming. Both Muslims and Christians, as well as Jews, worship the same god, and it doesn t matter in which language someone offers praise.That being said, these particular Muslim men shouted  Allahu Akbar  into an oh-so-dangerous megaphone   exactly as Christian street preachers can be seen doing on a regular basis, just in a different language (However, some  Christian  extremists simply show up at mosques with guns).The unidentified Muslims pulled up in front of St. Andrew Orthodox Church in Riverside, California, on public property, and shouted  Allahu Akbar  a few times before driving off. This was a completely harmless encounter with no weapons involved, and they were simply sharing the Christians message:  God is the greatest. But Fox News reports they said the phrase  maliciously,  as though they do not praise the same god in their own religion. Nevertheless, these men are Muslim, so panic ensued. Via Fox News: Allahu Akbar!  the unidentified man repeated several times as the unnerved parents drew their infants close and exchanged worried glances.Witnesses were able to give Riverside police a description of the green Honda Civic, but not of the three occupants. Some told police they believed one or more of the men may have been taking photographs, according to Officer Ryan Railsback. Although Trenham insisted multiple congregants heard the Arabic phrase, Railsback noted no mention of it was in the police report.Whatever the case, no law was broken   even if an unmistakable message was sent and received.This completely harmless incident that even Fox News had to admit was not a criminal act prompted the  Christians  to increase security  and they want the Muslim men to  repent  for saying  God is the greatest. Be calm and to keep a special vigilance over the property and our children while we are at church,  Trenham wrote in an email to parishioners. Pray that these provocative young men might repent of their intimidation and be saved.  He says that the situation   the situation, once again, being that some Muslims said  God is the greatest  at a church   is  tense and tenuous  and has vowed to keep new church security officers on hand for all regular services (yes, those two words were so dangerous that they think they need security). It is a deep sorrow to live this way in the  new America, Trenham told Fox.Jim Hoft, head honcho at Gateway Pundit and architect of the  Michael Brown fractured Darren Wilson s eye socket  lie and many others, decided to portray the incident as such:No, you re not suffering from anything and if you need your eyes checked it has nothing to do with this. He actually portrayed the phrase  God is the greatest  as a  threat.  Just to add to the drama, MUSLIMS is in ALLCAPS. Hoft s readers were more than happy to heap more hate on the manure pile:            This was a brilliant move on the part of the Muslim men. all they had to do was repeat a common Christian message in Arabic, and the bigots quickly revealed themselves for who they are.

I love you,  Bentley told Mason in the recording.  I love to talk to you. Baby, let me tell you what we re going to have to start doing, we re going to have to start locking the door. If we are going to do what we did the other day, we are going to have to start locking the door.

Allen Farley caught Bentley on tape accusing the gambling industry in the state of spreading false allegations about him and Mason because he claims they were desperate enough to block his tax measures that they would sink to any low to do it. There is no affair going on,  Bentley claims in the audio recording. He then goes on to talk about Mason and how his wife is  jealous  of her and again denies that he is having an affair with her.The 25 minute phone call continues with Bentley denying that he ever used government money or the government plane to help him carry on the affair.Bentley then goes on to claim that there is a conspiracy against him orchestrated by the casino industry to force him to stop pursuing his tax agenda. Casino gambling people are feeding this story,  Bentley said.  These guys, let me tell you what they re most concerned about. They re most concerned about a lottery and me signing a compact with the Indians. That s what they re concerned about  That is the loaded gun right there.

He s been charged with attempted murder, but he and his lawyers are invoking Florida s insanely loose  stand your ground  law as a defense for him. That law has been used to justify all manner of shootings in that state.Brooke Tuchinsky, the victim, survived with a broken jaw. Sean Barnes, the shooter, claims he saw her open her purse and pull out something shiny. Fearing for his life, he pulled his gun and fired. However, Tuchinsky was found unarmed, and her purse was closed. She wouldn t have been able to put the object back in her purse and close it after getting shot in the face. Barnes told a bald-faced lie right there.Barnes  lawyers are maintaining that he never intended to use the gun for anything other than self-defense, and that Tuchinsky was allegedly stalking him. That s all he really needs for a defense. Florida s dangerous law has made vigilante justice, and shooting people out of anger, entirely too easy since people no longer need to prove they tried to get out of a situation before using lethal force.While Tuchinsky does have a history of causing problems for ex-boyfriends, she also said that Barnes threatened her: I bought a new gun and would love to use it on you and make it look like an accident or self-defense. In a sane state, that would be pretty damning, even if every word Barnes spoke about Tuchinsky s actions was true. But not in Florida. Never Florida. In fact, Miami judges have cleared several people from wrongdoing under  stand your ground,  and the Florida Supreme Court decided that anybody invoking  stand your ground,  had a right to a hearing before a judge, who would decide whether their claim was valid. If it is, then the case would be dismissed and the defendant wouldn t be held responsible for legal fees or court costs.It s a little difficult to claim  stand your ground  when you lied about the person you were facing being armed. And with that law, Barnes doesn t have to have tried to leave the Denny s after the two got into an argument requiring employees to separate them. The fact remains that, instead of leaving, he followed her, likely with intent to shoot her, and then shot her. Then he lied about what took place. That s horrible, regardless of how horrible his situation was.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The law, the four women argue in the suit, discriminates against infertile gay couples trying to conceive.State law requires large insurance providers to cover costly fertility treatments for patients medically unable to have children. The couples take issue with how the law defines infertility, which includes the inability to become pregnant after one or two years of unprotected sex, depending on a woman s age. Insurance companies have been able to deny coverage to gay patients who, although they have been medically diagnosed infertile, do not fit the definition, the suit says.Source: New Jersey.comErin Krupas is infertile.

We believe that Donald Trump s divisiveness, recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking unpopularity risk turning this election into a Democratic landslide, and only the immediate shift of all available RNC resources to vulnerable Senate and House races will prevent the GOP from drowning with a Trump-emblazoned anchor around its neck,  the letter states.  This should not be a difficult decision, as Donald Trump s chances of being elected president are evaporating by the day. Politico reports that it lists several of Trumps major stumbles since he threw his hat in the ring in June of last year including his offensive racist remarks about Mexicans and Muslims, his ties to Russia, and his attacks against a Gold Star family. And that doesn t include his most recent outrageous statements, which include calling President Obama the  founder of ISIS  and calling for gun nuts to assassinate Hillary Clinton. Those recent outrages have built on his campaign of anger and exclusion, during which he has mocked and offended millions of voters, including the disabled, women, Muslims, immigrants, and minorities,  the letter continues.  He also has shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies, including threats to ban an entire religion from entering the country, order the military to break the law by torturing prisoners, kill the families of suspected terrorists, track law-abiding Muslim citizens in databases, and use executive orders to implement other illegal and unconstitutional measures. And they go on to argue in favor of halting funds earmarked for Trump s campaign and re-routing the money to other campaigns. Trump s divisive and dangerous actions are not only a threat to our other candidates, but to our Party and the nation Every dollar spent by the RNC on Donald Trump s campaign is a dollar of donor money wasted on the losing effort of a candidate who has actively undermined the GOP at every turn. Rather than throwing good money after bad, the RNC should shift its strategy and its resources to convince voters not to give Hillary Clinton the  blank check  of a Democrat-controlled Congress to advance her big government agenda. Again, over 70 Republicans, including many heavy hitters, signed this letter to the RNC just like 50 Republican national security experts signed a letter denouncing the billionaire mogul earlier this week.And on the same day as details of this current letter are released, Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak summed up the GOP disgust with Trump and their worry over how he is affecting the party. OK, this shit s not funny anymore,  he wrote on Twitter.  Trump is threatening elected GOPers at all levels in places that haven t been competitive in decades  We are looking at an extinction-level event. This is the ultimate proof that Republicans know that Hillary is going to destroy them in November even though they really only have themselves to blame for creating the political climate that gave rise to an extremist opportunist like Trump in the first place.

That said, some are attempting to politicize this horrible tragedy, and in their attempts to do so, are actually causing more harm than good and impeding on the ability for law enforcement to properly do their job. For the sake of finding Seth s killer, and for the sake of giving the family the space they need at this terrible time, they are asking for the public to refrain from pushing unproven and harmful theories about Seth s murder. Gingrich either didn t hear or he didn t care. Either way, he s defiling the memory of someone s relative for cheap political gain.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This comes just two days after Trump called for  Second Amendment people  to shoot and kill Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.According to the suit filed yesterday by Vincent Bordini in Mecklenburg County Superior Court in North Carolina, Bordini is suing the campaign for its inaction over a situation in which former N.C. campaign director Earl Phillip  produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent s knee cap  while the two men were in Phillip s jeep.The incident happened on February 13, and the complaint reads: Phillip pushed the barrel into Vincent s knee. The barrel s pressure crinkled Vincent s blue jeans. Phillip ominously stared sidewise at Vincent while driving the Jeep down the road and the barrel into Vincent. Vincent froze. Phillip s gun was loaded and the safety was off. A bump in the road would likely result in a bullet hole, and worse, in Vincent s knee. After this incident, Bordini had gone straight to Trump s regional director to report the incident, and that s when the director told Bordini that he d also experienced similar threatening behavior from Phillip. Desperate for a solution to this terrifying situation, Bordini went even higher up the chain and tried to report the incident to Stuart Jolly, Trump s national field director. Despite all of the evidence against Phillip, nothing happened. Still determined to be heard, Bordini notified Trump s then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski about this incident. Once again, no action was taken by the Trump campaign and Phillip continued to work on the campaign. Bordini decided to have faith that the matter would be straightened out with time. According to the suit, Bordini was a passionate Donald J. Trump supporter. He decided that putting his head down and soldiering on was the best thing he could do for Mr. Trump. He had faith the Trump campaign would handle the situation internally. But once again nothing came of Bordini s complaints and less than a month later, Bordini resigned on March 12. Bordini is suing for  assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress  in the suit.You can read the court document below:Featured image via Richard Ellis / Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Last night you said the President was the founder of ISIS. I know what you meant. You meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.Trump: No, I meant he s the founder of ISIS. I do. He was the most valuable player. I gave him the most valuable player award. I gave her too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.Hugh Hewitt: But he s not sympathetic to them. He hates them.

You can listen to King s remarks below:That almost sounds like resignation to the fact that Trump is destroying his campaign and dragging the GOP down with him. Coming from an elected Republican like King, this is a pretty powerful statement   especially considering all that the Republican Party has done to smear Clinton s name. Of course, King is still going to vote for Trump in November, but it sounds like he s coming around to accepting Clinton as the probable next president of the United States.Clinton has been smart in recognizing that so many anti-Trump moderate GOPers are looking for their place in this election, and she is positioning herself as someone who can unite people.

Trump even touted the story of his supposed generosity and heroics. The Trump campaign has confirmed to Hannity.com that Mr. Trump did indeed send his plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami, Florida to transport over 200 Gulf War Marines back home,  Hannity bragged.Not so fast, says the Washington Post.According to WAPO, not only is Trump fibbing about sending HIS plane to help the Marines, he had absolutely nothing to do with helping the troops.As usual, Hannity relied on a source who passed along rumors that Trump sent his plane to pick up the Marines. Cpl. Ryan Stickney told a story that he heard from someone else that  Mr. Trump found out about it and sent the airline down to take care of us. WAPO noted, however, that Trump s private plane was certainly not involved because it was the wrong color and only had enough seats for 24 people. Basically, Trump s own plane would have had to make ten trips or he would have to have owned ten planes. And let s face it, Trump s not that rich.In fact, it was a pair of Boeing 727s from Trump s failed airline with a capacity of 130 seats each that came to save the day and those had already been contracted out to the military long before they were needed at Camp Lejeune. It turns out when Trump bought the shuttle (Trump Shuttle) from Eastern Airlines, he made a bad deal, accepting an additional five planes instead of a lower purchase price because the market had turned south,  The Post reports.  So some of those extra planes were contracted out to the U.S. military to ferry personnel in the United States during Operations Desert Shield/Storm in 1990-1991. So Trump is taking credit for something he had no part of and Hannity is lying in order to make the candidate he backs look good.WAPO even spoke to Lt. General Vernon Kondra, the man in charge of all airlift operations, and he didn t hesitate to swat down the claim that Trump personally came to the rescue.Kondra said the notion that Trump personally arranged to help the stranded soldiers made little sense.  I certainly was not aware of that. It does not sound reasonable that it would happen like that. It would not fit in with how we did business,  he told The Fact Checker.  I don t even know of how he would have known there was a need. In conclusion, WAPO slammed Hannity for not doing his homework and for reporting rumors as facts and gave Trump the maximum number of Pinocchios.Despite the rumors on base, it s clear that Trump had nothing to do with the dispatch of the jet to the troops stranded at Camp Lejeune. The aircraft that ferried the troops was part of the Trump Shuttle fleet, at a time when Trump barely had control over the airline and was frantically trying to negotiate deals with bankers to prevent the collapse of his business empire.Trump Shuttle had a contract with the military, and this flight home was part of that contract. Simple as that.Sean Hannity needs to prominently correct this article. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, earns Four Pinocchios for confirming a story that is easily debunked.Thus far, Hannity has not thrown a temper tantrum about being outed as liar, but stay tuned. It s likely he may very well do so since he has a problem with facts and the real journalists who report them.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The fact is, the invasion of Iraq   under misrepresentations to the American people, has done more to inflame the terrorists than any action you can name,  Pelosi said.Pelosi then lit into Trump for his suggestion that  Second Amendment people  are the only ones who can keep Clinton from becoming President and appointing Supreme Court justices who would do away with the right to bear arms altogether. It was clear that he didn t understand that the words of a presidential candidate, a nominee, weigh a ton,  she said.She said that Trump could have chosen any voter base to make his point. He could have chosen the  anti-choice pro-lifers or those against immigration. But he didn t. He chose to call out the Second Amendment gun nuts, which Pelosi said was  very problematic  given  the manner which he did.

As a conservative who believes our ideas are good for America, it is pretty gloomy these days.The southern lawmaker acknowledged Trump would be a difficult candidate to sell to the American people, considering the GOP s lack of a coalition with women, minorities, LGBT, and youth voters (yet they re still a Trump supporter), which means they don t care about the bran issues facing their party. There was some hope that the disaffected, so-called silent majority would be broad enough and turn out in large enough numbers to give Trump a chance.

Priebus also allegedly told Trump he would have been better off staying at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, after the convention.Considering Democrats are poised to take back the Senate and make significant gains in the House, the Republicans should utterly and completely dump Trump.The alleged phone call stemmed after Trump s confrontation with the gold star Khan family, and his refusal to endorse Paul Ryan and John McCain.Trump, of course, denied this, saying:He never said that.

A new study, though, shows that Trump is pointing his stumpy finger in the wrong direction. The blame lies squarely with his Republican party.The report was published by the Economic Policy Institute. It blames Republican austerity, not Democratic spending, for the fact that economic growth was just 1.2 percent during the second quarter, and frankly, it hasn t been spectacular for a long time. It s easy to blame the man in the White House, which is what Republicans do, but they are wrong.The EPI places the blame on 2011 s Republican budget cuts, fiscal austerity at the state and local levels, GOP states  refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Instead of cutting spending during the recovery from the Great Recession, we should have been spending more   specifically on infrastructure and on programs that help people.This economic recovery has been the slowest over the past four business cycles. For example, the employment recovery from the trough of the Great Recession to its pre-recession peak took 51 months. Following the recession in the 1980s, employment recovery took 11 months. In the early 1990s it took 23 months, and in the early 2000s it took 39 months.The US government would have had to spend an additional $1tn in 2015 alone to match the spending that followed the 1980s recession, Bivens said. While such spending might run up the US deficit   something Republicans in Congress are opposed to   it would also have led to  several years of full employment  and the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates.Source: The GuardianAnother problem is the low interest rates. During the recovery from the 80s recession, the interest rates started at 9.3 percent. Now, with interest rates approaching 0 percent, and have been for a long time, there s no place to move them.The study does place some blame on the Obama administration, though. He didn t make effective enough use of the bully pulpit.The Obama administration  could have made a louder and more consistent case that the slow recovery had concrete, identifiable roots in decisions made by the Congress,  Bivens wrote.  Had the Obama administration made such a powerful case for why austerity was hampering growth, it could have educated the public and potentially helped build support for more sensible policy the next time the United States faces a recession.

That may be true with Evangelicals and Protestants, but that s not the case with Catholics, Jews and Muslims.But there is one religious group that is stuck between a rock and a hard place: Mormons.It s no secret Mormon voters (especially in Utah) hate Donald Trump. He s arrogant, vulgar, an adulterer, a liar and a sneak. And he openly exults it with little to no shame.The New York Times found that Trump does in fact have a  Mormon  problem, with only 33 percent having a favorable view of the Republican candidate. In the Utah Republican primary, Trump finished dead last with only 14 percent of the vote (Ted Cruz won).When it comes to Hillary Clinton, Mormons often give the same response   the cold shoulder   but not with the same vitriol as shown to Trump.That s why Clinton is seizing the opportunity and appealing to weary voters in Utah and aboard, hoping to solidify a coalition of traditional religious, Republican voters.In an op-ed featured in a newspaper owned by the Mormon Church, Clinton makes that appeal head on, writing:I ve been fighting to defend religious freedom for years. As secretary of state, I made it a cornerstone of our foreign policy to protect the rights of religious minorities around the world   from Coptic Christians in Egypt to Buddhists in Tibet. And along with Jon Huntsman, our then-ambassador in Beijing, I stood in solidarity with Chinese Christians facing persecution from their government.We stood up for these oppressed communities because Americans know that democracy ceases to exist when a leader or ruling faction can impose a particular faith on everyone else.Clinton drew parallels between Mormons, who were once profiled and discriminated against, and Trump s call to ban Muslims from entering the United States:Everyday Trump continues to prove he lacks the morals to be our commander in chief. With a new and outrageous headline seeming to pop up every day, it s easy to forget that Trump showed us his true colors early on, when he proposed banning all Muslims from our shores. That would undue centuries of American tradition and values. When it comes to religion, we strive to be accepting of everyone around us. That s because we need each other.The editor of the newspaper shed some hopeful light on the prospect of a Clinton win for Utah, stressing that the Republican, Mormon voter base has a  libertarian streak  when it comes to the issue of immigration, which affects the southwest more than any other region in the United States. Sensing that immigrants make communities stronger, Mormons tend to be more sympathetic to their plights. And the newspaper also noted that Mormon voters are  very sensitive  to religious persecution, which Trump has successfully made a crux in his campaign.The last Democrat to win Utah was Lyndon Johnson in 1964.

After police found evidence that he d fired his gun inside his house, he admitted his lies to the police. He told them that he was his daughter s killer after a noise she made woke him up, and her yell startled him.In other words, he thought she was an intruder, and fired his gun before making sure he knew who was in his house. While there s every possibility that he thought it was someone coming after him, this kind of thing is a growing problem as we increasingly refuse to respect the danger that guns are.Worse, he s a convicted felon. Felons aren t supposed to be able to have guns, and yet, he had one. It s not clear how he came to own a gun, despite having previous convictions of felony drug possession and attempted criminal homicide, and yet, he had one. Why?His daughter s death was a mystery in the town of Hendersonville, Tenn., where people were shocked to learn of Timea s death   nobody could figure out what an 11-year old could possibly have done to get herself shot in the few feet there were between the bus stop and her house. Police were confused as to why there were so few clues other than her father s account of what happened.Later that evening, though, the case took a turn when police investigated Batts  house and found that Batts had fired his gun. He s now facing charges of reckless homicide, tampering with evidence, false reporting and felon in possession of a firearm. He s currently being held on a $1 million bond, and his cousin has actually started a Gofundme account in order to raise money for his bail.He could have obtained his gun legally or illegally, but the fact remains that his daughter would still be alive if he hadn t shot first and thought later.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But when infamous Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson went on MSNBC to try and explain Trump s statements, her  logic  left host Kate Snow literally  speechless  when Pierson tried to play it off like Trump had merely been talking about encouraging gun owners to vote against Clinton. Pierson said: The NRA is a bipartisan organization. And that is also left out of the discussion in the media, considering how there are even Democrats who won t touch gun legislation in an election year because the NRA has been able to take out Democrats as well. Snow argued that Trump had called on gun owners to stop the former Secretary of State as if she had already been elected and was picking liberal Supreme Court justices. Snow said: He s assuming she s in power. And then says there s nothing you can do about it at that point    Well, but maybe the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. Pierson continued to insist that Trump was talking about the NRA being able to stop senators from appointing people that are hostile towards the Second Amendment. Snow tried to make Pierson understand the severity of what Trump had said, whether it had been misinterpreted or not: If his words are misinterpreted as president, he will not get a do over as president of the United States. I think that s what a lot of people are reacting too here. You don t get a do over. Pierson did what any GOPer does when they re cornered   change the subject to blaming Obama and Clinton for everything. Pierson suddenly began talking about the the horrible things that have already happened while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department  and even threw Obama under the bus while she was at it. Snow kept trying to keep Pierson on subject, pressing her: You have no concern about his ability as president   if here were president   to make an argument with foreign leaders, in negotiations and not be misconstrued or misunderstood? What Pierson said next stunned Snow to the point where she had no words for several seconds. Pierson said: He wasn t talking about policy. He wasn t talking about implementation of policy.

After a long, awkward silence, Snow finally said, I m speechless because I m trying to follow your logic here, Katrina, and I m having a hard time.

On  Good Morning America,  Giuliani dumbsplained that The Donald couldn t have possibly threatened Clinton   because the crowd didn t cheer loudly enough. We know Donald Trump is not particularly indirect,  Giuliani told George Stephanopoulos. If Donald Trump was going to say something like that, he d say something like that. Hillary wants to abolish   essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don t know,  Trump said on Tuesday, echoing right-wing rhetoric typically associated with dealing with political enemies. But I tell you what, that will be a horrible day, if Hillary gets to put her judges in, right now we re tied. For years, conservatives have accused President Obama and Hillary Clinton of attempting to strip guns from the hands of Americans, calling for the assassination of both political figures as the only way to deal with the perceived problem. The need to murder the President and former First Lady is a sentiment echoed by many of Trump s followers, especially the  Second Amendment People    and one Trump himself seems to have adopted in his rhetoric. This is something Giuliani clearly recognizes. However, he says that Trump didn t say the thing he said because the enthusiastically hateful crowd didn t cheer loudly enough: You know how speeches go. He was talking about how they [gun rights advocates] have the power to keep her out of office. That s what he was talking about. With a crowd like that, if that s what they thought he d meant, they d have gone wild. Trump fans have repeatedly called for the former First Lady s arrest and execution at his rallies, with The Donald and other speakers egging them on. Since Clinton has done nothing illegal and can not be imprisoned, assassination is left as the only option for many of them, including Trump, who projected a message of hopelessness clearly intended to encourage gun nuts to take action on his behalf.The threat was so serious that the Secret Service has made the unprecedented move of commenting on the clear federal offense via Trump s favorite platform: Twitter.The Secret Service is aware of the comments made earlier this afternoon.  U.S. Secret Service (@SecretService) August 9, 2016A former top Secret Service official told Time that if he was still with the agency, he would  contact someone on Trump s campaign staff to have a conversation about whether he understands the consequences of that rhetoric.

This statement prompted the Secret Service to take the unprecedented step of responding to an assassination threat by a presidential candidate against an opposing candidate, whom the Secret Service is charged with protecting and would be in the line of fire should a right-wing gun nut answer Trump s dog whistle.And it appears that at least one gun nut is interpreting Trump s dog whistle call as a call for armed insurrection if Hillary Clinton becomes president and doesn t pick who they want her to pick as a Supreme Court Justice.Greg from Michigan called into C-SPAN on Wednesday morning and while he denied that Trump was calling for Hillary to be shot and killed he frighteningly declared that Trump was actually calling for a bloody armed revolt if conservatives don t get their way.

By any objective analysis, this is a new low and unprecedented in the history of American presidential politics. This is no longer about policy, civility, decency or even temperament. This is a direct threat of viol ence against a political rival. It is not just against the norms of American politics, it raises a serious question of whether it is against the law. If any other citizen had said this about a Presidential candidate, would the Secret Service be investigating?Candidate Trump will undoubtedly issue an explanation; some of his surrogates are already engaged in trying to gloss it over, but once the words are out there they cannot be taken back. That is what inciting violence means.Rather is absolutely right. Had anyone else but Donald Trump said this, they would have been arrested and thoroughly interrogated, no questions asked.And Trump is already making up excuses. It was a joke. He meant more bodyguards and armed citizens. He meant protecting the Second Amendment in the Court. Yadda yadda yadda. More excuses from the candidate that  tells it like it is. For the people who like Trump because he speaks his mind, they certainly have to make excuses for what he says all the time.It s time the other media heads follow Rather and break this  objectivity  that stops them from criticizing Trump when he says something stupid.

The comments come as Trump has been hyping the conspiracy theory that the general election will be  rigged  by Clinton and the government. Many view those comments as an acknowledgement from Trump that nearly every single poll taken over the last few weeks shows him losing badly, both nationally and in key swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio.Trump has repeatedly embraced conspiracy theories and fringe personalities since running for President, including the council of dirty trickster Roger Stone (who has accused the Clinton and Bush families of murder) and 9/11 truther Alex Jones.A few months ago, Trump bragged that he could shoot someone in the middle of the street and still be supported.The call for gun violence echoes that of Tea Party Senate candidate Sharron Angle, who proposed  2nd Amendment remedies  as the cure for liberalism in her 2010 race in Nevada. Angle was beaten in that election by Senator Harry Reid.The National Rifle Association has endorsed Trump, and is running a multi-million dollar ad campaign in favor of his presidential bid.

After a disastrous two weeks following the Republican National Convention, where Trump attacked a Gold Star Family, took a Purple Heart from its recipient and lied about ransom money being handed to Iran, his poll numbers are tanking. He s now behind by double digits.

After all, he s gotten this far being a xenophobic asshole. Why let a sinking ship tempt him to plug the holes in his campaign? Trump, naturally, disagrees with his critics: I think that my temperament has gotten me here,  Trump said during a phone interview on Fox Business s  Mornings with Maria.

I certainly don t think it s appropriate to start changing all of a sudden when you ve been winning,  Trump said.  I think it s going to work out well.

He accuses all the Republicans turning against him of being  insiders,  whose opinions shouldn t matter to Trump s angry anti-establishment voters.Trump s refusal to acknowledge that he needs to win a broader support only adds fuel to the fire of the idea that he s unprepared for the presidency. He won 14 million votes during the primaries, which is a lot for primaries, but it s not even a drop in the bucket for the general election, where more than 10 times that many people will likely vote.

If a woman attacks Donald Trump, he ll attack her back just like he would with a man!  McGuirk continued.  He doesn t look at her as a delicate little flower. We can t you let you get away with that,  Smith said before Meghan McCain gave McGuirk a piece of her mind, informing McGuirk that Trump desperately needs women right now more than he needs white men.

Board of Education. Wallace literally blocked a doorway into the University of Alabama to prevent African-American students from enrolling. It took the U.S. Deputy Attorney General and federal marshals, plus President Kennedy s threat to send in the U.S. Army s 2nd Infantry Division, to force Wallace to step aside. Now, Roy Moore is trying to block same-sex couples from entering courthouse doorways.And for defying the highest court in the land, Moore has not only been booted off the bench via suspension for ethics violations, he s about to stand trial.On Monday, the Alabama Court of the Judiciary rejected Moore s effort to get the charges against him dismissed and ordered him to stand trial in September.And like many crazy conservatives, Moore lashed out by accusing the Southern Poverty Law Center of being the power behind the charges made by the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission. They re the ones who hired the prosecutor, they re the ones that brought the case for the second time,  Moore claimed.  They don t want anybody opposing the agenda of the homosexual movement. That s what they don t want. Of course, the SPLC is actually not involved so Moore is clearly trying to blame everyone except himself. He s the one who failed as a judge for not carrying out the ruling of a higher court. He s the one who tried to impose his own extreme religious beliefs onto the people of Alabama instead of obeying the United States Constitution, which gives the Supreme Court the final say on what is constitutional or not.SPLC president Richard Chen easily smacked Moore down in a statement. We ve said it many times, he acts as if he is the Ayatollah of Alabama. Instead he is an elected state judge required to follow the oath of his office, which makes federal law supreme, whether he likes it or not. It is unseemly and it is dishonest. Alabama is a great state and deserves better than a chief justice who thinks he is the law unto himself. Roy Moore should be ashamed of himself and the people of Alabama should be ashamed that they ever elected such a lunatic to head their state s highest court. This man should never have been allowed to be a judge and he should be removed for denying gay people the same full rights and privileges that straight Americans enjoy even after the Supreme Court made their landmark ruling.Featured Image: Facebook ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Donald Trump threatens to destroy that legacy of respect for the environment and protection of public health,  the statement read.Ruckelshaus was EPA administrator under both Reagan and Nixon. Reilly served under Bush. They both praised the environmental policies of the administrations they had worked under but said Trump doesn t have the slightest clue. Donald Trump has shown a profound ignorance of science and of the public health issues embodied in our environmental laws,  they said.  He hasn t a clue about Republicans  historic contributions to science-driven environmental policy. The former EPA heads also slammed Trump for his claim that climate change, which they called  the singular health and environmental threat to the world today,  is nothing more that a  hoax. It  flies in the face of overwhelming international science and the public conviction and commitment of almost 200 national governments that adopted the Paris Agreement on climate change in December 2015,  they said, pointing out that their  leadership was essential to that agreement. To back away now, as Trump wants to do, would set the world back decades years we could never recover. The young people in this country deserve far better than that as our legacy,  they addedThey wrote that Clinton, on the other hand, acknowledges climate change as the threat that it is and is concerned about protecting the environment. She is committed to reasonable, science-based policy to meet those challenges,  the men wrote. For us, there is simply no choice in this election,  they concluded.  We Republicans should be shocked, outraged even, at the prospect that all this progress, this legacy will be repudiated and rolled back by Donald Trump.

Chomsky himself isn t completely pro-Hillary   he is actually quite critical of her on certain things like foreign policy   but he makes an eight-point argument that Trump is such a danger to this country, progressives would be smart to vote for the  lesser evil. In fact, Chomsky flat-out says that voting for Clinton could very well save the planet because Trump is such a major threat to not only Americans, but the entire world. In his piece, Chomsky points out that on the subject of climate change alone, Trump is deadly. He said: One of these candidates, Trump, denies the existence of global warming, calls for increasing use of fossil fuels, dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to India and other developing nations as called for in the Paris agreement, the combination of which could, in four years, take us to a catastrophic tipping point. And Chomsky hadn t even addressed the fact that Trump continuously insults other countries, doesn t have an ounce of empathy in his bones, and is not emotionally stable enough to be trusted with the codes to nuclear weapons. However, Chomsky s major take-away here is that in this election, Americans shouldn t see voting as a moral act   at this point, we need to do whatever we can to prevent a devastating outcome: Trump in the White House. Chomsky wrote: Voting should not be viewed as a form of personal self-expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values, or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites. Chomsky reached out to progressives in particular when he said: The left should also recognize that, should Trump win based on its failure to support Clinton, it will repeatedly face the accusation (based in fact), that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a Trump administration. You can read Chomsky s entire piece here. This of course, is hardly the first time Chomsky has urged Americans to come to their senses about Trump.

From The Donald s promise to our allies that we can t be trusted if he becomes President, to his threat to essentially throw out the Iran nuclear deal by modifying it until it is meaningless, to his almost salivating over the thought of pushing the  big red button  and unleashing our nuclear arsenal on, presumably, the first world leader to make him angry on Twitter, The Donald has succeeded in getting himself ranked as one of the top 10 global security risks.It s gotten to the point that fifty top Republican officials have now signed a letter acknowledging that Trump would put at risk our country s national security and well-being.  According to these Republicans, many of whom were top aides or cabinet members for George W. Bush (so they are well aware that a President can be a top national security risk), Trump lacks the character, values and experience  to be President and that he would be the most reckless president in American history.  The NY Times reports:The letter says Mr. Trump would weaken the United States  moral authority and questions his knowledge of and belief in the Constitution. It says he has  demonstrated repeatedly that he has little understanding  of the nation s  vital national interests, its complex diplomatic challenges, its indispensable alliances and the democratic values  on which American policy should be based. And it laments that  Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself. None of us will vote for Donald Trump,  the letter states, though it notes later that many Americans  have doubts about Hillary Clinton, as do many of us. Among the most prominent signatories are Michael V. Hayden, a former director of both the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency; John D. Negroponte, who served as the first director of national intelligence and then deputy secretary of state; and Robert B. Zoellick, another former deputy secretary of state, United States trade representive and, until 2012, president of the World Bank. Two former secretaries of homeland security, Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, also signed, as did Eric S. Edelman, who served as Vice President Dick Cheney s national security adviser and as a top aide to Robert M. Gates when he was secretary of defense.Robert Blackwill and James Jeffrey, two key strategists in Mr. Bush s National Security Council, and William H. Taft IV, a former deputy secretary of defense and ambassador to NATO, also signed. He is unable or unwilling to separate truth from falsehood,  the letter says.  He does not encourage conflicting views. He lacks self-control and acts impetuously. He cannot tolerate personal criticism. He has alarmed our closest allies with his erratic behavior. All of these are dangerous qualities in an individual who aspires to be president and commander in chief, with command of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Many of the signatories declined to add their names to a similar letter in March, but say Trump s promise that Russia would be  rewarded  for hacking his political enemies and his vow to be selective with which allies we defend caused many to change their minds.John B. Bellinger III, who served as Ms. Rice s legal adviser at the National Security Council and the State Department and who drafted the letter, says that  some  of the signers  will vote for  Clinton, and some will not vote, but all agree Trump is not qualified and would be dangerous. Trump indeed would be dangerous, not just to our allies but to average Americans thanks to his proposed Muslim ban and his unabashed attempts to prop up the Ku Klux Klan by warmly embracing their support   among, of course, other things.You can read the full letter below:  Donald Trump National Security Letter by German Lopez on ScribdFeatured image via Getty Images/Scott Eisen""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

[emphasis in source]Since Kerr can t actually accomplish that, he is, instead, turning one of Trump s biggest insults to those who serve and sacrifice into something positive.

If Trump knew, he d probably have a conniption because his name is tied to this.The money is going to three different groups:In short, Kerr found a way to turn Trump s insults, dullness and hatred into something good.

On Monday, right-wing garbage pit Zero Hedge published an article that postulates that Hillary Clinton is not healthy enough to be President because of a photograph that began making the rounds on right-wing websites over the weekend.NORTH CHARLESTON, SC   FEBRUARY 24: Democratic Presidential candidate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton slips as she walks up the stairs into the non-profit SC Strong, a 2 year residential facility that helps former felons, substance abusers, and homeless move into self-sufficiency February 24, 2016 in North Charleston. The South Carolina Democratic Presidential Primary is held on February 27. (Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images)This recent rash of attacks on Clinton for the photograph, which shows her being helped up the stairs after she slipped in February, is being presented as something recent   and certainly not as a simple stumble on the stairs. This desperate attempt to malign Clinton has, in the short time since the photo s publication, become so downright insane that Glenn Beck s  The Blaze  was forced to step in and be the voice of reason:However, despite the photo s date, conservative outlets and blogs ran with the  shock photo  to showcase the  questionable health condition  of the former secretary of state in stories dated Sunday, Aug. 7.The Drudge Report even bannered the images on its site Sunday night with links of years when Clinton has supposedly fallen. Mediaite reported that the other links on the Drudge Report homepage included a YouTube video of Clinton stumbling as she boarded Air Force One in 2011 and a New York Times story about her treatment for a blood clot in 2013.Despite that idiotic speculations about Clinton s health have officially become too insane for The Blaze, the right wing has adopted them whole-hog. Another rumor the Stupid Part of America is using to support this insane theory spawned from a photograph of Clinton slipping on a stair accuses her of having  seizures  on camera.  ZeroHedge posted random photos of Clinton coughing over the years, claiming that  Hillary has at multiple times had convulsions that appear to be seizures on camera, including a series of seemingly inexplicable coughing fits. And then there was her on-camera  seizure  that wasn t a seizure: A frequently referenced video, shown below, alleging that Hillary may have seizure-like conditions emerged several weeks ago and has so far failed to lead to a conclusive explanation whether Hillary may have ongoing health problems and potential residual aftereffects from a blood clot in her brain sustained three years ago. ZeroHedge published a choppy GIF with no sound and multiple rewinds in an effort to deceive their really, really stupid readers into believing it was actually a seizure. The actual video shows Clinton was using exaggerated facial expressions to feign surprise when she was asked if she had spoken to Elizabeth Warren about the Vice Presidency.After her exaggerated reaction, which drew laughter from those surrounding her, Clinton suggested that people try the chai, holding up her cup. Snopes noted last month that: Notably, rumors that Clinton was captured on camera undergoing a seizure didn t start circulating until well over a month later, when they were presented without any evidence beyond uninformed speculation. But, hey, why not completely misrepresent it to cause conservatives to speculate about her health? Their other baseless attacks aren t working anyway. They re even speculating about Clinton s  handler,  who appeared on stage with Secret Service when a recent rally was interrupted by protesters. The man told her to  keep talking  and assured her that the protesters would be handled.Secret Service agents walk on stage during Hillary Clinton rally https://t.co/Btp1na4Pxt  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) August 4, 2016ZeroHedge informs us that the man might be a doctor (completely without evidence) who may or may not carry something that resembles a Diazepam pen for Hillary Clinton s alleged seizures.Since these accusations are baseless at best, they are quite popular with ZeroHedge s readers:                 Sorry, conservatives, but you have shown no evidence that there is need to question Hillary s health.

She might have married another American just four years before becoming Mrs. Trump.The story was broken by Univision, proving that taking away reporter access can backfire on a candidate. They claim that an immigration attorney who worked for the Trump Organization said Melania obtained a green card  based on marriage  in 2001. That was four years before she married Trump.But, Michael Wildes, an immigration attorney who worked for the Trump Organization, told Univision s investigative unit that she obtained a green card four years earlier in 2001,  based on marriage. Melania and Donald Trump were not married until Jan. 22, 2005 at Bethesda-by-the Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida.Wildes asked the Trump campaign for more, and so far, crickets.When asked to explain the marriage discrepancy, Wildes said he would seek clarification, presumably from the Trump Organization. He later sent an email saying  I didn t hear back, sorry. Wildes is someone who should know. He was the immigration attorney for Trump s models and for the Miss Universe pageant when it was run by Trump. According to Univision, he s not a defector from Trump, in fact, he was authorized by the Trump campaign to speak on their behalf.Still, Wildes says there are some things he can t discuss because of privacy issues.The Clinton campaign, officially, anyway, is refusing to make anything of this story. One former federal prosecutor, who is a Hillary supporter said that it s all  moot and ridiculous. Here s the video:The Clinton supporter is essentially right, but it does point to complete hypocrisy from the Trump campaign. Trump doesn t care about immigration issues. He never has. Trump almost prefers to hire immigrants over Americans, and well, his marriage history proves that he prefers his wives come from elsewhere. I m sure Democrats would be happy to drop the issue if, in exchange, we received a little intellectual honesty from the Trump campaign. Instead, Trump will continue bashing immigrants, and even people born in America to immigrant parents, while going home at night to a woman who very well might be one of the  illegal immigrants  Trump and his supporters love to rant about.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

After declaring, three months out, that the election will be rigged to favor  crooked  Hillary Clinton, the public knew exactly what was going on   Trump is already preparing for a loss.But even though Trump has shown he can t lose with grace, media outlets are not letting him get away with the insane assertion that an entire national election, which requires the participation of all 50 states to work, will somehow be  stolen  from him.And Fox News may have delivered the most brutal smackdown of this assertion.In a recent op-ed, Julie Roginsky, who runs a crisis management firm, slammed Trump for lacking the  patriotism to put his country and its institutions ahead of his own ego  and delegitimizing the American electoral process:Never in modern history has the loser of a presidential election challenged the legitimacy of our national elections.  Even in these times of unprecedented partisan rancor, candidates have put partisanship aside in the interest of patriotism and national unity.  What has separated the United States from third-world nations is our fundamental faith in our institutions and the belief that our laws supersede political strife.This week, Donald Trump changed all that.  Even before the first vote has been cast, he informed Sean Hannity that our electoral process was fundamentally illegitimate, that our democracy was as subject to political whims as that of Putin s Russia or Mugabe s Zimbabwe.Over 240 years of a nation that prides itself on fair, open and honest elections, crapped on in one minute by a racist reality-T.V. star. All that work, that bipartisanship and good-spirited nature, gone, because the fat, orange blob said so.While giving no evidence as to how, and citing the often debunked claims of voter fraud, Trump is successfully convincing his base that he s such a winner that if he loses, it must be because the states and the party elite are in bed for Hillary Clinton (even though multiple polls have her beating Trump by over 10 points). He s even successfully convincing his supporters that the United States is a corrupt entity, with a secret group of elites who enforce a dictatorship-like approach when determining who wins presidential elections.This is why  citizen presidents  like Trump and Jill Stein are so damaging to our electoral process   everyone is crooked but them.Roginsky then drew a parallel between the great Al Gore and Trump:Despite being urged by many of his supporters to keep fighting during the Florida recount in 2000, Vice President Al Gore conceded the election to Governor George W. Bush in the interest of national unity, stating that,  [T]onight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession. George W. Bush s election was certified by a Republican secretary of state in Florida, where his brother was then governor.And with a conservative Supreme Court handing the victory to Bush, still Gore did not complain one iota. He accepted the results, and was poised like a real leader should be   disappointed, but supportive of our institutions.Trump is completely inept, and the fact he s already preparing for a loss (which he calls rigged) shows that he has failed to grasp how America s most sacred institutions work.Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They tried tirelessly to change the rules of the Republican National Convention to keep Donald Trump from officially becoming their standard-bearer. When the rule change was shot down, chaos ensued on the convention floor in Cleveland s Quicken Loans Arena as they demanded a roll call vote, which was also denied. This resulted in a walkout by the Colorado delegation, and, of course, the great Orange One was officially given the banner of the party to carry that Thursday night. Most people assumed that the  Free the Delegates  group was done after this. Nothing could be further from the truth, though.This same group of people is now calling for an emergency meeting of the Republican National Committee as they launch yet another sure-to-fail effort to dump Trump. It bears noting that this likely is mostly an effort to continue making noise, to show the RNC and the American public that the entire GOP is not like Donald Trump. The proposed purpose for the meeting is to lay out the law about how the RNC could go about defying the will of the Republican primary voters and get rid of Trump. They will be particularly interested in Rule 9, which is a provision specifically created to facilitate the replacing of an official nominee because of death, declination, or otherwise.  Since Trump isn t dead and likely won t be dropping out,  otherwise  is the vague word these Never Trumpers will be looking to find their loophole in.It probably won t happen, but seeing as how Trump is falling further and further behind Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls, they have reason to believe that he simply isn t a viable candidate. Further, the sea of controversy in which Trump has engaged since being formally nominated, from his ongoing feud with the family of a fallen Muslim American soldier to his initial refusal to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Senator John McCain, means that Trump clearly has zero capability or intention of becoming presidential. If all else fails, the #NeverTrump people could always support the new Independent bid by conservative intelligence official Evan McMullin.All of that being said, though, these folks may as well hang it up.

No longer is the 10+ polls outliers as this grueling election comes down to the wire. Clinton leads with 50 percent to Donald Trump s 37 percent, while three percent remain undecided and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee, garners 7 percent.Just before the two major party conventions, the same poll had Clinton leading only by 2 points, 45-43 percent.The new Monmouth University shows almost total party unity, with Clinton nabbing 92 percent of the Democratic vote, up from 85 percent in July when she clinched the nomination. Trump collects only 79 percent of the Republican vote, down from 81 percent in July. Trump does, however, slightly have the lead with Independent voters, 32-30 percent.

These educated women, according to the poll, is one of the biggest reasons Donald Trump is falling so far behind Clinton.Over 60 percent of respondents said Clinton has the temperament to be president while only 27 percent said Trump does, and over 60 percent of respondents are sick of hearing of Hillary Clinton s emails.Hillary Clinton is continuing her climb against the orange fascist, a telling, tangible showing that America is no longer flirting with a Trump presidency   they re scared of a Trump presidency.And rightfully so.

I hate the way they spend our money.  Donald has avoided releasing his tax returns to the public and now we know why.In 1987, Donald signed off on a series of accounting changes that allowed his first hotel to shortchange New York City by nearly $3 million in rent.Just 10 years previously, Trump made a deal which would free the hotel of $160 million in property taxes over the course of 40 years. While that sounds good so far, it was also supposed to guarantee the city a small financial stake in its success: New York City received annual rent payments tied to the Grand Hyatt s profits, according to CBS.In 1986, the hotel had its best year, raking in nearly $80 million. City officials expected to receive at least as much as the $3.7 million paid the year before.But that never happened because a month after Trump and his partners signed off on the accounting changes, the city was paid only $667,155.For two years, city auditors were stonewalled each time they tried to address the issue.Experts asked by CBS News to examine the city auditor s report, which was completed in 1989, described the behavior of hotel and Trump Organization officials as  unusual  and  unheard of. Something was fishy there,  Karen Burstein, who was the city s auditor general at the time, said referring to the hotel s owners.  This was not the behavior of an innocent party. I think that s what became evident to us. When a date was eventually agreed upon for an audit, it was cancelled by hotel lawyers in a rare move. It s one of those things you want closure on. Why would you want this hanging over your head?  said Tobey, a partner at Perelson Weiner LLP, which audits corporations, hedge funds, private equity funds and non-profits.  Stonewalling auditors is not a common practice. You want to make them go away. When city auditors finally got a glimpse of the goings on at the hotel, they found missing books and unacceptable accounting principles. Hotel officials tried to keep the audit from being released to the public, much like Donald is doing with his tax returns now.According to Donald, he doesn t remember any of this. I sold the hotel many years ago for a tremendous profit. By building the hotel I created thousands of jobs, saved the Grand Central area, and helped to revive a dying, at the time, New York City,  Trump told CBS.  The city was extremely happy with that development and you re now bringing up something thirty years later that I ve never heard about.

Like Trump, the man has never been elected to any public office whatsoever; however, he is also a seasoned member of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). McMullin currently serves as Chief Policy Director of the House Republican conference, and is certainly much more qualified to do the job of president than Trump could ever dream of being. To that end, sources say that McMullin is going to enter the presidential race with one goal in mind: stopping Donald Trump.According to Buzzfeed, this could turn out to be a very serious bid, as top GOP operatives who refuse to back Trump and openly criticize him, such as Rick Wilson, would firmly back McMullin s attempts to derail Trump s path to the White House. McMullin might have a tough run, though, because he is pretty much invisible to be such an important inside player in GOP politics. His Twitter account has very few followers compared to most politicians and other public figures, and he also has no verification. However, that has not stopped him from sharply slamming Trump to what following he does have. Here is one such tweet:Authoritarians like @realDonaldTrump use promises of law & order to justify infringing on civil rights as they consolidate control by force.  Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) July 22, 2016Also, regarding Trump s increasingly divisive and bigoted statements against Muslims, McMullin posted to his Facebook what all sane, educated people already know: Trump s rhetoric makes us less safe, not more safe with regards to radicalized terrorists: As Donald Trump continues attacking Muslims and as a former CIA officer, I d like all Americans to know the truth: American and other Muslims have played a central role in virtually every counterterrorism win we ve had since 9/11. They are an indispensable asset in this fight. Attacking them as a group makes America weaker, not stronger. While McMullin s battle will be uphill, there are growing mutterings that he would have serious support. However, at this point, he will likely not be able to be on the ballot in all 50 states at this late date, and he will likely face campaigning and money issues. Also, we all know the fate of third party bids at the national level.Now, make no mistake, liberals: This guy is not our dream come true. He is a true blue right winger who would still usher in social policies that would prove nightmarish for many groups, including women and LGBTQ people. He is a Mormon, and, like Mitt Romney, has strong support in Utah, where Trump is heartily disliked. Our best hope is that McMullin splits the GOP even further than Trump has, thus handing the election to Democrats.The only other option would be for the GOP to dump Trump in favor of McMullin, which seems highly unlikely at this time.Featured image via Evan McMullin Twitter""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Even Romney s surrogates didn t admit outright that his economic plan was going to kill the economy, not stimulate it. When the Tax Policy Center said that Romney s plan would require raising taxes on the middle class to avoid ballooning the national debt, his campaign, and the entire GOP, came to his defense.Back in June, Moody s said that Trump s economic plan would cost us millions of jobs in addition to raising the national debt by $11 trillion. Trump only has a tiny part of his massive tax cuts offset. The rest amount to a massive black hole in the middle of the budget, which, in turn, would cause interest rates to skyrocket. Skyrocketing interest rates, when combined with other factors, harm corporate output, and eventually, stock prices.We all know what happens when the stock market crashes.Predictably, Trump s campaign said there were  profound errors  in Moody s analysis.

Shahram Amiri disappeared in 2009 during a trip to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. For a year he was missing, but then resurfaced in the United States in June of 2010. Amiri says that he had been kidnapped by the CIA and put under intense psychological pressure to reveal sensitive information.  He claims that he rejected the United States  efforts to break him, but the U.S. Government said at the time that Amiri had defected voluntarily, and had been paid millions of dollars for  useful information  related to the country s nuclear program.The next month, he appeared in Washington DC at the Iranian interests section of Pakistan s embassy, seeking to return to Iran.Days later, he obtained passage home, where he originally received a hero s welcome. But in May of 2011, he was arrested and tried for treason. Though his family believed he had been given ten years in prison, which would have made him eligible for release in 2022, he was actually sentenced to death. Finally, his execution was carried out on August 7, 2016. Amiri had access to confidential military secrets and was connected to our No. 1 enemy, the Great Satan,  Islamic Republic of Iran spokesman Gholamhosein Mohseni-Ejei said in his weekly news conference.  He was sentenced to death in primary court, and the sentence was confirmed by Supreme Court  after Amiri appealed the decision. The CIA thought that its movements were kept away from the eye of Iranian Intelligence Ministry,  Mohseni-Ejei said.  They took Amiri to Saudi Arabia. To most, this seems fairly standard. He released video informing his country that he betrayed their national secrets to the CIA, the United States confirmed that he had done so, and for some reason he thought it was safe to return home. This is documented history   unless, of course, you re Tom Cotton.You see, Amiri was mentioned in recently-released Clinton emails. According to Cotton, the messages, which did not become public until very recently, were the cause of Amiri s 2011 arrest and death sentence. We have a diplomatic,  psychological  issue, not a legal one. Our friend has to be given a way out,  Richard Morningstar, a former State Department special envoy for Eurasian energy, wrote nine days before he returned to Iran.  Our person won t be able to do anything anyway. If he has to leave so be it.  On  Face the Nation,  Cotton tossed a thick layer of blame on Clinton: I m not going to comment on what he may or may not have done for the United States government, but in the emails that were on Hillary Clinton s private server, there were conversations among her senior advisors about this gentleman. That goes to show just how reckless and careless her decision was to put that kind of highly classified information on a private server. And I think her judgment is not suited to keep this country safe,  Cotton added, apparently forgetting that all of this happened years before her emails were released.In fact, the timing doesn t seem to matter to anyone on the right wing. Gateway Pundit s Jim Hoft, more commonly known as the  stupidest man on the internet  (seriously, Google it), declared that Clinton s  unprotected  emails  got [an] Iranian nuclear scientist executed. They found out he was working for the US thanks to Hillary Clinton s emails,  Hoft writes.  Nice work, Hillary.  He even includes this cute little tweet: Unfortunately for all of them, a quick Google search quickly disproves their latest stupid, stupid theory related to Hillary s emails.F*ck off, Tom and Jim.Watch Cotton try to blame Hillary below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Zakariah also says that he does not use the term lightly. I was asked by CNN to make one more case where Donald Trump had said something demonstrably false and then explained it away with a caustic tweet and an indignant interview. I replied that there was a pattern here, and there is a term for a person who did this kind of thing, a bullshit artist. I was not using that label casually, and in case you have sensitive ears, I m going to use it a few more times. At that point in the segment, Zakaria explains that he was borrowing the term from Harry Frankfurt s classic essay,  On Bullshit    rather than just using it as a derogatory descriptor in the colloquial sense.Zakaria then delves into more examples of Trump s bullshit artistry, including his promise that he will flip blue states red, without giving any inclination as to how he intends on doing so. Harry Frankfurt concluded that liars and truth-tellers are acutely aware of facts and truth. The bullshit artist, however, has lost all connection with reality.

Trump and his supporters have alleged that the media is out to get Trump since the onset of the primary election. Now that Trump s polling numbers have been in a free-fall since the general election began, they are more desperate than ever to prove that it is all because of the media s bias against their candidate.Scottie Nell Hughes, one of Trump s most vocal surrogates, has previously spoken out against the press at large, claiming that the media is conspiring against Trump. Hughes reiterates Newt Gingrich s recent claim that roughly 70% of those in the media have a tendency to lean to the left politically. The figure that Hughes is regurgitating appears to be erroneous; there was a study conducted in 2005 that showed that news does favor more liberal positions. However, the reality of the situation is that most media outlets tend to either be biased towards one side of the political spectrum and cater to that audience.Much of the debate during the segment centered around Trump s plummeting polling numbers. You know, polling can be skewed too,  Kremer, another Trump surrogate mentioned. He made the claim that polling numbers are affected  By the way the questions are [asked], the number Democrats versus Republicans that are polled. So, you can t say that there s not any bias in the polling because I believe there certainly is. Well, of course, those factors do a play a part in public polling. As anyone who is going to go on a cable television show and talk about polling numbers should know, those biases are taken into account by pollsters. If they are not, they typically get disregarded.The other claims that the surrogates make during the episode are just as easy to explain away. That does not stop the Trump supporters from trying to explain how Trump truly is just a victim of the media s liberal bias. It couldn t possibly have anything to do with his flagrant, hateful sentiments that he has made during his very short political career. Nor the fact that his policy proposals change on a whim and to sound like they originated from a neo-Nazi s fever dream.You can watch Trump s surrogates try and rationalize their terrible candidate s failures below, in full.Featured image from video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Not only does Suhayda think that Trump presents an opportunity to build new, politically active white nationalist coalitions, he also believes that Trump will win the election in November for  various reasons.  Suhayda believes that the  enemy  is in for a real surprise: I m gonna project, that I believe that Trump is going to win the election this November, for various reasons which I don t want to go into again.

And Hannity has been only too happy to let Trump make his unsubstantiated claims on his show, which will likely anger Fox viewers and make them even more paranoid than they already are.So Brian Stelter used the end of his show on Sunday to teach Hannity how real journalists interview candidates.  Let me show you how not to interview a candidate about something as serious as this,  he began before slamming Hannity for  failing  his audience. Hannity s not a journalist, but he has a megaphone, and he s using his megaphone irresponsibly. If a Democratic candidate were saying this stuff saying the election could be rigged then every word of this essay would apply to him or her. But right now, it s the Republican candidate for president who s trying to delegitimize our democratic process without proof. It is unpatriotic for any interviewer or any journalist to help him. Indeed, if the shoe were on the other foot Hannity wouldn t give a damn at all. He would call any Democratic claims of a rigged election absurd. You know, because only Republicans win elections fairly. If they lose it must be because the election was  rigged. Here s the video via YouTube.And of course, being as thin skinned as Trump, Hannity lashed out on Twitter.Hey Brian check Philly enquirer after 2012. How many districts not a single Romney vote. Check Cleveland.

So you are voting for the liar HRC. Did DNC hurt Bernie? https://t.co/Wuf5Sv9nCR  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) August 7, 2016 Unreliable liberal sources.  Brian, answer a simple question. Is HRC a liar? https://t.co/Wuf5Sv9nCR  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) August 7, 2016As you can see, Hannity is citing a single newspaper report in order to claim that the election is rigged because not a single person voted for Romney in 59 districts in Philadelphia in 2012.But the Philadelphia Inquirer itself conceded that  such results may not be so startling after all  considering Philadelphia has a majority African-American population especially in these urban districts. In fact, when the Inquirer attempted to find the few Republicans listed in the voter registry they had either moved away or had voted for Obama after being mistakenly identified as Republicans.They also noted that John McCain didn t receive a single vote in 57 of the districts in 2008.The Inquirer also pointed out the factors that led to such a lopsided result.First, President Obama is the first African-American president, so black voters were especially supportive of him. Obama won 93 percent of the black vote nationwide.Second, Republicans have largely abandoned fighting for things African-Americans care about like affirmative action and urban development.Third,  many parts of Philadelphia and other big cities simply lack Republican voters  and it has been this way for decades going all the way back to Franklin D. Roosevelt s presidency.And finally, Romney said a lot of stupid things, including commenting about people  wanting free stuff from the government  after visiting the NAACP. Such comments did not go down well with the black community who felt Romney was talking about them.Factcheck.org even pointed out that  the 59 that went 100 percent for Obama in 2012 constitute 19,605 votes, just 3 percent of the total votes cast in the city. Of course, if Hannity really wants to bring up Philadelphia as some kind of proof that Democrats rig elections, we could similarly point out that some precincts in Utah voted unanimously for Romney. Does that mean Republicans rigged the election there? Or does Hannity just deal in double standards?Featured Image: Screenshot ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But thanks to Donald Trump, they could come back around.A recent poll from OH Predictions based out of Arizona has Clinton beating Trump by three points, 45-42, the second poll from the same nonpartisan organization to show Clinton ahead of the blowhard billionaire. When factoring in the two polls from OH, with others showing a close competition, RealClearPolitics has the two evenly tied in their average for winning. In 2012, Romney won Arizona by 9 points.And how is it that Clinton could be beating Trump in Arpaio-Brewer county? His feud with the Khan family.Across the country, in Georgia, a new poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper shows Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump in the state by four points, which is still within the margin of error, but a surprising lead nonetheless in a southern red state run by Nathan Deal.A poll from July 31 showed the two tied, and when coupled with the new poll showing Clinton ahead, the RealClearPolitics average has Trump leading by 2.4 percent. In 2o12, Romney won Georgia by eight points.While facing a loss in the swing-state of Colorado, Politico has summed up the issue currently facing Trump:For Trump, it s a worrisome sign of a narrowing electoral path to victory. At the outset of the election cycle, the GOP nominee already confronted what appeared to be a Democratic advantage in the Electoral College. The potential loss of a key Western swing state leaves even less margin for error in November, increasing the urgency of winning the big prizes of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida.With a loss in Arizona and Georgia, and losing Colorado, Trump is looking at a prospective tail spin in the American electoral process, and it s glorious.Imagine how much of a surprise the Trump campaign would get if they lost Georgia and Arizona on election day, completely throwing off their trajectory?

He also attacked Reid directly, calling her a politically correct progressive who is not on America s side.Reid began by playing footage of former CIA Director Michael Hayden slamming Trump s  erratic  behavior and suggesting that Trump could very well be a  unwitting agent  for Putin. Furthermore, Trump is unpredictable and dangerous, especially since he would have control of America s nuclear arsenal as president.Indeed, Trump has various business connections with Russian oligarchs who are aligned with the Russian president, who has directed Russian state media to support Trump s campaign. Trump also softened the GOP platform stance against Russia. Trump s ties with Russia are especially concerning to intelligence agents, who are worried about briefing Trump because whatever he is told could end up being passed along to Putin. You are pretty much fighting an armada of intelligence experts,  Reid told Paladino. In your mind,  Paladino told Reid.  No, not in my mind,  Reid replied.  Actually in my ears because we re listening to them speak. Then Paladino proceeded to embarrass himself by going on a rant about Reid. I think what s happened to you is that you ve been in a conditioned box, for a long time, of political correctness. Political correctness and a certain way of doing things. And when a guy comes on the scene who shows real leadership qualities, who can talk to the America people, and they can find faith in him and confidence in him that he s gonna do the right thing   when that man comes on the scene, you guys just don t know what to do. Clearly, Paladino must have missed a poll that shows 70 percent of Americans have a negative view of Trump, with 56 percent feeling this way strongly.That s probably what Reid was thinking about when she smiled as Paladino ranted. The progressives are gonna lose their influence and their power and their control of the American people s minds, and you re in a panic state right now,  he continued before Reid chimed in with sarcasm. Oh yeah, were panicking,  she said.After accusing Reid of  making crazy accusations,  Reid fired back with facts.

As the GOP wants to deprive poor women of health care, if they had their way these expenses would be crippling. This doesn t even take into account the extra care a child would need, the exhaustion involved in caring for a critically-ill baby, or a number of other factors that would cause someone with the Zika virus to make the difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy.The state of Florida is currently facing a Zika crisis, but that doesn t stop Senator Marco Rubio from sticking to his guns on abortion. To him, women should never be allowed to have one, even in the cases of rape and incest   and not even if the mother has contracted the Zika virus. He told Politico on Saturday: I understand a lot of people disagree with my view   but I believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. And when you present it in the context of Zika or any prenatal condition, it s a difficult question and a hard one. But if I m going to err, I m going to err on the side of life. Obviously, microcephaly is a terrible prenatal condition that kids are born with. And when they are, it s a lifetime of difficulties,  Rubio added.  So I get it. I m not pretending to you that that s an easy question you asked me. But I m pro-life. And I m strongly pro-life. I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life. No matter how much the child suffers, right, Marco?Rubio himself voted to fulfill President Obama s request for funding, so he is aware that there is an issue. He s not hiding from that. But his belief in a book written by a bunch of men who couldn t figure out where the sun hides at night, as well as his devotion to the very party that actively fights to keep women sick, prevents him from accepting the fact that women have the right to make their own health care decisions   including terminating a pregnancy if they have the Zika virus.Meanwhile, as Republicans continue to hold funding hostage over gutting the Clean Water Act and letting truckers drive for longer hours without a break (yes, seriously), Rubio and his ilk will continue to fight against women s right to choose an abortion to save the child from a lifetime of suffering.Featured image via Getty Images/Joe Raedle""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Everything is evil, liberal propaganda to them if it doesn t fit their narrative, and this part of the Opening Ceremonies definitely didn t fit with what they like to hear (what did they want? Something flashy and superficial, no doubt). So they took to Twitter to lash out as only conservatives can when they re faced with facts.Rio Olympics so far, quite boring   pushing global warming propaganda.They mention N Pole losing ice but NEVER mention growing ice at S Pole  PolitixGal (@PolitixGal) August 6, 2016 #OpeningCeremony at #RioOlympics just went full SJW retard on global warming.

The fundraiser was started by Lieutenant Cameron H. Kerr, a veteran who lost his leg while serving overseas in Afghanistan.Kerr writes that he decided to launch the fundraiser after Trump was handed a Purple Heart by a veteran supporter of his at a campaign event. After receiving the medal, Trump stated that he has  always wanted to get the Purple Heart,  and that  this was much easier. As Kerr notes, Trump s comments were made  just days  after he began verbally attacking the family of a Muslim service member who lost his life while in combat. The family spoke out against Trump at the DNC and have been hammering Trump in public ever since then.Kerr writes on the GoFundMe page: As with seemingly everything else in his life, Mr. Trump got one handed to him instead of earning it. That being said, as a Purple Heart recipient who earned one the old-fashioned way by returning from Afghanistan one leg lighter, I fully endorse his desire to earn one and would happily oblige his interest in doing so, by being one of the first to chip in to fly him to the conflict zone of his choosing. After all, you re never too old to follow your dreams. Kerr doesn t actually intend on using the money raised to fly Trump to a combat zone. Instead, he plans on donating the funds to organizations that help refugees. The organizations are ones that Trump would probably despise. Particularly the International Rescue Committee, an organization that helps newly arrived refugees in the United States.Kerr has a goal of raising $50,000 dollars. At the time of this writing, the GoFundMe has received more than $26,000 dollars in just three days. Kerr is officially promoting the fundraiser with the hashtag, #PurpleTrumpsOrange.As the radical right-wing begins to become ever more so brazen with their schemes to tear the U.S. apart and leave behind it s carcass to ravaged by the billionaire class, it s good to see people fighting back with humor and positivity.

North Carolina s GOP implemented a series of voting reforms that are a blatant attempt to disenfranchise voters of color. On Saturday, Rev. William Barber, a respected political activist, appeared on MSNBC s A.M. Joy where he slammed North Carolina Republicans for passing these discriminatory laws.The main target of Barber s ire is North Carolina s Republican governor, Pat McCrory. McCrory, while he wasn t busy reappropriating North Carolina s disaster relief funds to fight for the right to discriminate against LGBTQ people, signed voter disenfranchisement reforms into law. He is also now trying to do everything he can to keep those laws in place, including appealing to the Supreme Court.Barber touched on this matter during the interview saying: I think the Supreme Court will leave it like it is. This was a unanimous decision. The judge who wrote the decision actually dissented when we asked for a preliminary injunction. When she received the whole record, she reviewed it and saw that this was not disparate impact, but intentional discrimination. Barber then went on to compare McCrory to the infamous racist George Wallace: The suggestion that these jurists who are above reproach are involved in some kind of conspiracy, a partisan conspiracy, you know that sounds more like some of the things that George Wallace said back in the 60 s, rather than what a 21st-century governor should be saying. As other voting rights advocates have noted, the court decision under discussion is one of the greatest anti-disenfranchisement victories in recent memory.  Given the consistently unanimous legal agreement n the matter, it is hard to believe that McCrory will get his way and continue the GOP s nefarious scheme to keep voters of color from practicing their rights as Americans.You can watch the segment below, in full.Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It reveals a shocking absence of elementary decency and of natural empathy for the most profound of human sorrows   parental grief,  Krauthammer wrote.  It wasn t a mistake. It was a revelation. Krauthammer then put his psychiatry skills to work, slamming Trump s narcissism and thin skin. Trump s hypersensitivity and unedited, untempered Pavlovian responses are, shall we say, unusual in both ferocity and predictability.This is beyond narcissism. I used to think Trump was an 11-year-old, an undeveloped schoolyard bully. I was off by about 10 years. His needs are more primitive, an infantile hunger for approval and praise, a craving that can never be satisfied. He lives in a cocoon of solipsism where the world outside himself has value   indeed exists   only insofar as it sustains and inflates him. Krauthammer went on to say that Trump is struggling to  pass the threshold test for acceptability,  comparing this year s election to the 1980 Election in which Reagan defeated incumbent President Jimmy Carter.  Trump badly needs to pass that threshold,  he wrote.  If character is destiny, he won t. Indeed, Trump is definitely no Ronald Reagan. Reagan spoke positively about America and the future while Trump is all gloom and doom and doesn t know when to keep his mouth shut.Krauthammer is not the only mental health professional who has talked about Trump s mental health status either.Dr. Drew Pinsky appeared on CNN earlier this week and expressed concern about Trump s temperament and impulsiveness. The question, though, is, are some of the reckless qualities that everyone is getting so disturbed about on the campaign going to be translated into office should he get elected? That s a pretty hard thing to predict. I don t know if this is just somebody playing politics, or is this somebody who really can t contain their impulses? When I hear people that are impulsive with their speech, I worry about hypomania and bipolar types of conditions. Pinsky went on to question the mental stability of Trump s supporters.Clearly, there is something wrong with Donald Trump and he is not fit to be president of the United States at a time when there is so much conflict and upheaval in the world. We need a steady hand at the helm, not a hand that lashes out over every little slight and criticism, especially when that hand belongs to a man who is obsessed with using nuclear weapons.

It s easy to behave this way when you re mentally ill,  director Rob Reiner chimed in.  It s not like he s trying to lose. He can t help himself. Then Santorum took his turn and instantly became the punching bag for Maher and the other two panelists when he attempted to defend Trump as some kind of change-maker while portraying Hillary Clinton as a politics-as-usual candidate.Setmayer pointed at Santorum and pointed out that people like him are to blame for Trump getting this far while Rob Reiner once again pleaded,  Stop being mentally ill. Santorum claimed that Trump was relatively tame on Friday, prompting Setmayer to ask if Trump seriously  wants a cookie for acting like an adult  for once.Maher explained that Trump can never be president because  his number one priority is getting back at anybody who has slighted him in any way. Santorum continued repeating how Trump has tapped into some kind of anger among conservatives who think they are being ignored, but Setmayer hit back by noting that there s a way to do that  without acting like a petulant child,  and that Trump is an embarrassment.Santorum then attacked Hillary Clinton by claiming Trump isn t a liar like her by bringing up her emails again, which drew the ire of Rob Reiner. Let s talk about the FBI! There was one email! One email that was not listed as classified   with a little tiny  c    and James Comey said anybody could have missed that! Enough of that! Enough of that! Bill Maher agreed, saying that he is  sick  of hearing about Hillary s emails all the time.The panel continued piling on Santorum with Setmayer doing the most damage and then Maher slammed Republicans for  handcuffing themselves to a dead hooker  by making Trump their nominee and catering to a base that hates and denies facts.Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump is an embarrassment to this country and as this episode of Maher demonstrates, even conservatives are embarrassed that he is the Republican nominee.

That number seems to be much higher than those brave folks who are openly denouncing Trump, though. Politico conducted an anonymous poll of GOP insiders, and a shocking 70% of them are not only as horrified as the rest of us are by Trump, but they actually want him out of the 2016 race and out of the Republican Party. A couple also went on to express their fears about Trump regarding his effects on the party: I d rather take our chances with nearly anyone else than continue with this certain loser who will likely cost the Senate and much more. The effect Trump is having on down-ballot races has the potential to be devastating in November. His negative image among Hispanics, women and independents is something that could be devastating to Republicans. Trump s divisive rhetoric to the Hispanic community at large has the potential to be devastating for years to come. While many seem to wish Trump would leave the race, most   58%   believe that he will not. One GOPer from New Hampshire had a rather sarcastic reply regarding that subject: I also wish I could lose 20 pounds, cut 5 shots off my handicap and play the piano. It s not just the party they should be worried about, though. It s the safety of the nation. Trump is dangerously unqualified. The most patriotic thing they could do would be to do all they can to undermine his candidacy, take one for the team, and try again with someone who is actually qualified in 2020. If you cannot do that openly, at least, in the privacy of the voting booth, do what you ve done here and vote for the candidate who is actually qualified. You survived Obama.

FiveThirtyEight.com is looking at Georgia right now, which has consistently voted for Republican candidates in every presidential election going back to 1992. However, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are virtually neck-and-neck there, and there are other races that show Georgia possibly turning purple this year.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution just released a poll showing Hillary leading Trump 41 percent to 38 percent. While that is within the margin of error for that poll, other polls likewise show a very tight race there. Trump is still favored to carry Georgia and its 16 electoral votes, with a 55 to 72 percent chance of winning, according to FiveThirtyEight s polls-only and polls-plus models, respectively. This poll shows a growing chance that Trump will lose there.Hillary would have a 59 percent chance of winning if the election were held today. Georgia doesn t have a huge chance of being the state that decides the outcome of November s election, but the fact that it has a chance at all is astounding, given the rabid conservatism there. With a Georgia win, FiveThirtyEight s electoral maps give Hillary 270 to 275 electoral votes even if she loses Ohio, Pennsylvania, and possibly Florida.It s not just the presidential race that s making Georgia stand out. Senator Johnny Isakson is struggling to keep his seat amidst a tight race with his Democratic opponent Jim Barksdale. Isakson only has a six-point lead right now, compared to his previous two elections, both of which he won by more than 17 points.Nationwide, another poll shows that more people favor a Democratic Congress than a Republican Congress. Six years of Tea Party obstruction, childishness and general craziness has likely soured people s opinions of the GOP, and the train wreck that is Donald Trump isn t helping. In fact, Isakson s race (along with Sen. Kelly Ayotte s and others) is confirming GOP fears that Trump s poisonous influence is starting to harm down-ticket races.Georgia s stunning transformation into a battleground state is due in part to its changing demographics. There s a swiftly-growing black community there, and the black community nationwide tends to vote overwhelmingly Democratic. Trump s shunning of so-called  political correctness,  along with his blatant racism, is probably amplifying that effect.Like what s happening in Utah, this is an interesting and surprising development. Georgia is well-known as a Republican stronghold. Now, it s further evidence that the GOP s stranglehold over many states is weakening.Photo of Hillary by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.

For quite some time, the right wing has been on the attack against Planned Parenthood, and now the women s health organization is fighting back in the best way possible: by, as they say, working to  engage historically disenfranchised communities. On Friday, Planned Parenthood announced that it will begin registering voters at its clinics, on college campuses, and at other locations, regardless of their background, beliefs, or political ideology.  In other words, they don t care if a woman is exercising her right to have an abortion or is standing outside holding signs and spewing threats at people who enter their facilities. They just want more people to vote. If we can t all participate in our government, we all get cheated,  Anna Keene, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, told the Huffington Post.  We re launching the  My Vote, My Voice  campaign to help ensure that every voice is heard and every vote is counted in communities across the country. No matter what your political beliefs are, if you don t or can t vote, then you can t elect officials who will keep your best interests in mind. While the campaign itself aims to register any voters, it is unlikely that conservatives will allow themselves to be registered by Planned Parenthood. Since the organization attracts the young, low-income people, and people of color   all groups that are more likely to support Democrats. The launch of the program is tied to the 51st anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, a 1965 law that once protected the rights of African-Americans to vote before the conservative-heavy Supreme Court gutted it in 2013. Our purpose is to engage historically disenfranchised communities,  Erin Carhart, Planned Parenthood manager of youth organizing, explained.  Our hope is to encourage folks to participate in democracy. This is just one more reason Republicans will continue their desperate and nonsensical attempts to close Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide. Not only will they be enabling women to make the healthcare choices that are right for their individual circumstances, but the organzation will be creating more and more voters who will be likely to vote BLUE in November.

Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump s global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States  responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US  withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump s foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight  perceived or real  Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump s eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot  and that s just his  fellow  Republicans.He isn t eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn t have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children.President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too.This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party s elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said,  America is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great. De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.The Harvard Republican ClubGood going, Harvard Republicans.

The first time Americans began to realize just how out of touch Romney was was when he was asked about women s equality, he cited that he had  binders full of women  he could consult.Well, Trump had his binder full of women moment on Friday and it was even worse, and more gender blind, than Romney s. When asked what women he would name to his cabinet, he was only able to name one, and that was Ivanka. Okay, to be fair, there was a second woman, the reporter asking him softball questions, who also happened to be a former Miss Florida contestant.The interview was with First Coast News in Florida, and reported in Buzzfeed.(Reporter and former Miss Florida contestant, Angelina) SAVAGE:  who you would actually put into office as one of your first female, in your cabinet? TRUMP: Well, we have so many different ones to choose. I can tell you everybody would say,  Put Ivanka in, put Ivanka in,  you know that, right? She s very popular, she s done very well, and you know Ivanka very well. But there really are so many that are really talented people   like you, you re so talented, but I don t know if your viewers know that.SAVAGE: Is this breaking news?

It s not working. Only 28 percent of young women are fooled by Trump s transparent attempt at seeming woman friendly. Fewer than half of all voters see Ivanka favorably.

Ultimately, a government shutdown would have occurred and Republicans would have been blamed like they were in 2013 when Ted Cruz persuaded Republicans to defund Obamacare that October. The standoff was a disaster for Republicans who were overwhelmingly blamed in multiple polls and would have resulted in the United States defaulting on the national debt had the shutdown not been ended by Republicans backing down and funding the law.Furthermore, Hannity didn t care about the national debt when President Bush was busy adding trillions to it with two wars that lasted over a decade. Bush took a surplus left by Bill Clinton and turned it into a $1.4 trillion deficit that Fox News and Republicans immediately tried to blame President Obama for. And just so Hannity knows, President Obama s fiscal responsibility has nearly eliminated that deficit.This is the second time in a month that Hannity has flown off the handle because he couldn t deal with being criticized.The first incident occurred just after the Republican Convention in Cleveland when Jon Stewart took over Stephen Colbert s desk and delivered an epic smackdown of Hannity for being hypocrite by hating on President Obama for certain things while loving the same things about Trump.Here s the video of that epic mocking via YouTube.And of course, Hannity responded by losing his sh*t on his radio show.It s really no wonder why Hannity supports Trump.

Mike Huckabee, who had no problem setting aside his  Christian  morals to defend Trump, a man who has none, defended Trump s meltdown by insisting that he will be surrounded by the best people if he is put the White House even though Trump hasn t exactly done that during his campaign or at the convention, where most Republican shunned Trump and he ended up bringing has-beens like Scott Baio to Cleveland.Well, Seth Myers had a response to that as well.

So even with spoilers, Clinton blows Trump out of the water.What s even more fascinating is the McClatchy-Marist poll shows Clinton with an 8 point lead among men, and a 23 point lead among those who identify as moderates. Clinton is also viewed as more presidential than Trump by 14 points (53-39).When it comes to who can best handle the War on Terror, immigration, gun violence, trade and jobs, Clinton bests Trump in EVERY category, by a margin of 4-21 points.While Clinton gained in Democratic support, going from 83 percent to 90 percent, Trump lost among Republicans, going from 85 percent to 79 percent.So Jill Stein isn t siphoning off Clinton supporters, but it would appear Gary Johnson may be gaining with Trump supporters.

They re right, but, predictably, her campaign said that s not true. She s merely focusing her attention on keeping her seat, and Trump is irrelevant to her race.Then they dropped this gem, which isn t going to help her in the slightest: It s just not good manners to attack the nominee of your party. Oh please. When the nominee of your party is as dark and dangerous as one Donald Trump, attacking him may well be the only way some of these Republicans keep their seats.Ayotte is one of three Republicans that Trump has refused to endorse, and he bashed her over the weekend while inexplicably and laughably saying,  I m leading her in the polls. I m doing very well in New Hampshire.  Just, what?

New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Michigan have all pivoted solidly toward Hillary, at least for now, when she and Trump were virtually deadlocked before the Trump Train went off the tracks.Perhaps one of the most surprising aspects of these polls is that western Michigan, which tends to be very Republican, has turned blue because of Trump s downward spiral. Hillary now has a nine-point lead in that state, along with an 11-point lead in Pennsylvania and a whopping 17-point lead in New Hampshire.Past polls showed Hillary within just a few points of Trump in all three states, setting the stage for a major showdown in the battlegrounds. Normally, that would likely continue   there s a reason these states are battlegrounds.The Trump Train is anything but a normal campaign, though. Richard Czuba, president of the Glengariff Group, Inc., says: He s sitting in the cellar right now, and they re going to have to do something to dramatically turn this around.If I were a Republican running on this ticket right now, I d be beyond nervous. Some of them are. There are Republicans running for re-election to Congress who have said that they can t support him. A Republican strategist actually said that not endorsing Trump is a badge of honor, instead of the horrible betrayal and kiss of death it would ordinarily be. Billionaire Meg Whitman, who votes for Republicans in presidential elections, has formally endorsed Hillary Clinton.Perhaps even more damning for Trump are conflicting reports about the state of his campaign. His campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his spokespeople say that everything is fine. One of his spokespeople even said that Trump s success is evident in the crowds he draws, the ratings he garners, and his fundraising. All of that implies that he thinks the polls are badly biased (isn t everything biased in Trumpland?).But an ally to Manafort said that even Manafort is ready to give up, and staff morale is virtually nil. That conflict further damages Trump as he struggles to convince America that he hasn t completely lost it.Speaking to that, GOP strategist Greg McNeilly says: I know that there s a lot of numbers that matter in politics, but Twitter followers still don t trump poll numbers. He said that Trump should stick to his  Make America great again  messaging. Trump doesn t know how, though, because he s Donald Trump and Donald Trump knows best, including when it comes to vanquishing his enemies, real and imagined. John Harwood, of CNBC, confirmed that when he said that Trump s campaign is unique because candidates don t usually have a stranglehold on their campaign s daily messaging. Trump, as a thin-skinned control freak, does.And that s how Trump likes it, so the GOP better get used to it. They nominated this train wreck. They get to handle the fallout right up until we go to the polls in November.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""The Republican Party should be prepared to lose the Hispanic vote by a record number this year as Donald Trump has basically just surrendered any chance the party had to reach out to them.After 71 percent of Hispanics voted to re-elect President Obama in 2012, Republicans claimed that they would work hard to bring them back into the fold to better their chances in 2016. Since then, however, the Republican Party has only doubled down on their anti-immigration stance and they chose Trump to be their nominee.Trump s poll numbers among Hispanics have since gone from bad to downright atrocious even as he scrambles to do ridiculous outreach efforts like eating a taco bowl or having white Trump supporters hold up signs saying Latinos support Trump to somehow draw Hispanic support to his campaign. And it looks like any substantial effort has just gone down the toilet as well.According to Buzzfeed, cancellations of outreach events and frustration among Hispanic volunteers and surrogates is imploding Trump s pitiful attempt to attract Hispanic support.RNC Chair Reince Priebus bragged prior to the Republican Convention that Trump  is going to be doing a Hispanic engagement tour coming up soon  and claimed Trump  understands  the need to expand the party in the general election.That apparently went in one ear and out the other as Trump has failed to meet with Hispanic leaders in Texas and Florida, which is only angering the few Republican Hispanic voters left.The campaign canceled an initial July 8 roundtable with Cuban business and faith leaders in Miami because of the tragic shooting in Dallas. Then the rescheduled July 26 event was officially canceled because the roundtable participants were out of town. (Three Republican sources told BuzzFeed News a hold was put on the campaign calendar for that time slot but the event was never planned.)Another unreported, but planned Hispanic event was also canceled: The July 5 event was supposed to bring Trump face-to-face with San Antonio business leaders and Texas Republicans, but after the campaign reached out for venue space and possible participants, the event was scrapped. I think they couldn t get enough people to come to the event because their support among Hispanic voters is 14%,  Republican voter Artemio Muniz said.  What do they expect? Indeed, Trump s is polling so badly among Hispanics that Hillary Clinton is currently leading him in all 12 swing states, including Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.Furthermore, 67 percent of Hispanic voters support Hillary Clinton while only 19 percent support Trump   77 percent of Hispanics view Trump unfavorably.Trump s performance among Hispanic voters in November would be even worse than Mitt Romney in 2012 if the current numbers hold. Romney was able to capture 27 percent in 2012. Trump is 8 points behind that mark and it may only get worse from there as he continues disparaging Hispanics wherever he goes and continues to fail at getting any outreach effort off the ground.It also doesn t help that Trump s campaign has rejected the effort of Ileana Garcia, who started Latinas For Trump, to lead a national effort to attract Hispanic voters. The Trump campaign got mad at her for telling reporters in Cleveland that she is the national Latino spokesperson for Trump. Now it appears she will not have a major role within the campaign at all even though Trump and the GOP desperately need someone to do something to stop the bleeding.At this point, it s very late in the game to convince Hispanic voters that Trump is somehow the right person to be president. He has made zero effort to reverse the damage he has done and only continues to do more damage. If Republican leadership didn t have buyer s remorse before, they certainly do now because it really looks like the only demographic Trump is courting is the white vote and that may have been enough to win 30 years ago, but it definitely is not enough today.Featured image via Twitter""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He calls them the  pussy generation,  you know, because of that pesky insistence that everyone be treated with respect. He s doesn t agree with Trump on everything, but as for all those racist comments coming from Trump, well, Americans should  just fucking get over it. I haven t endorsed anybody.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""This is the hypocrisy to beat all hypocrisies.As we all know, Donald Trump is vehemently anti-immigration. In fact, it s the centerpiece of his campaign going all the way back to June 2015 when he rode an escalator to a podium and delivered a speech officially throwing his hat into the ring.Since then, the Republican nominee has accused immigrants of being criminals who steal jobs from Americans.Well, now it looks like the same can be said of Trump s own wife Melania, who came to the United States from Slovenia.According to an investigation by Politico, Melania may very well have committed visa fraud and other immigration laws. And Trump s campaign has apparently been lying about her immigration story.In January, Melania claimed that she often flew back to Slovenia to renew an H-1B visa, a visa type that Donald Trump despises and has said he would end. It never crossed my mind to stay here without papers,  she told Harper s Bazaar.  That is just the person you are. You follow the rules. You follow the law. Every few months you need to fly back to Europe and stamp your visa. After a few visas, I applied for a green card and got it in 2001. But H-1B visas last three years and can be extended to up to six years, which means the First Lady wannabe did not have to fly back to Slovenia for renewal.As it turns out Melania is describing something people do when they aquire a B-1 Temporary Business Visitor or B-2 Tourist Visa, which means she is lying about the circumstances of her immigration to this country. Furthermore, it could also mean she took a modelling job away from an American citizen because her nude photo shoot occurred in the United States in 1995 and B-1 and B-2 visa holders are not allowed to work here. So Melania may have broken the law.Andrew Greenfield, an attorney specializing in immigration law, made that pretty clear. If you enter the United States with the intention of working without authorization and you present yourself to a border agent at an airport or a seaport or a manned border and request a visa, even if there is not a Q&A   knowing that you are coming to work   you are implicitly, if not explicitly, manifesting that you intend to comply with the parameters of the visa classification for which you sought entry and were granted entry. Another immigration attorney told Politico that if Melania used a B-1 visa she would have had to lie about the purpose of her entry into the country. She would not have been authorized to work in the U.S. while on a B-1 visa. In fact, if a customs agent encounters someone entering the U.S. on a B-1 visa and they know that the individual intends to work for a U.S. employer, the individual will usually be denied admission. In order to avoid being sent back to Slovenia, she may have had to lie about the purpose of her trip. In short, Melania Trump could be guilty of committing visa fraud which is a crime that would seriously jeopardize her green-card status and her United States citizenship.If she were not married to the Republican nominee and were of Hispanic or Muslim descent, Donald Trump would be calling for her to be deported and would be referring to her as an illegal immigrant and a criminal.It sounds like Donald Trump, his wife, and the Republican Party have some serious explaining to do.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Now, yet another sitting GOP congressman has come out saying that he cannot see how he could support Trump.Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill) came out on Wednesday with a laundry list of reasons that he cannot vote for Donald Trump. Kinzinger said: I ve said my intention is to get there. I want to get there, I m not there yet. I don t see how I get there anymore. Kinzinger attended Trump s coronation party reluctantly, with one hope: that he could get behind Trump. That didn t happen, though. In fact, Trump only worsened Kinzinger s opinion of him. He continued: You know, party unity, and all that. Woke up Wednesday morning, saw his comments about Article V, NATO, decided to hold off. Kinzinger himself is a veteran of the very war that Captain Humayun Khan was killed in, and Trump s week-long public feud with those Gold Star parents seems to be what finally pushed him into the #NeverTrump camp. He says: Then this spat, this unbelievable spat with the family of a fallen soldier, a fallen soldier who swore to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, wouldn t even initially say we honor the family for their service. Immediately took it as what it was to him, an affront to him. Then, Rep. Kinzinger said what we ve all been thinking that Trump seems to be beginning to cross a lot of red lines in the unforgivable on politics. While he does not plan to support Hillary Clinton because he disagrees with her on probably almost all things,  he will not be supporting Donald Trump either. Kinzinger went on to pivot to Trump s shocking and disturbing flirtation with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin: For instance, even yesterday doubling down on saying how great it would be to have a fantastic relationship with Putin.Our party, you know, me and other people in the party have said for the last six months how awful it was that Hillary Clinton did this reset with the Russians, and how we were taken advantage of. Now, you have Vladimir Putin basically pulling out the old KGB playbook on how to manipulate Donald Trump, and it appears he s fallen right into it. Of course I don t agree that Hillary did anything to endanger the country with regards to Russia and Putin, but Trump certainly would (and has). There s really no comparison between Hillary and Trump there. That being said, though, this man is doing the right thing. Regardless of political differences, he and I agree on one thing: Donald Trump should not be president. Kinzinger also says the one thing that his GOP comrades would do well to listen to with regards to this election: I m an American before I m a Republican.

However, his behavior in recent weeks has been so completely unhinged that people on both sides of the political aisle have been questioning his mental stability. Even the sitting president did something completely unprecedented and came out and said that Trump is quote,  unfit to serve as president. Now, a Democratic congresswoman from California, Karen Bass, has done what no one has had the courage to do, and started a Change.org petition calling for Donald Trump to undergo a mental health evaluation. Bass, who had a career in healthcare prior to running for office, says of her decision to move forward with what is surely to be a controversial move regarding the other party s standard-bearer in her petition: Donald Trump is dangerous for our country. His impulsiveness and lack of control over his own emotions are of concern. It is our patriotic duty to raise the question of his mental stability to be the commander in chief and leader of the free world.Mr. Trump appears to exhibit all the symptoms of the mental disorder Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). Mental health professionals need to come forward and urge the Republican party to insist that their nominee has an evaluation to determine his mental fitness for the job. Also, in case people had any doubt about what Narcissistic Personality Disorder is and how Trump fits the profile, Rep. Bass laid all of that out as well. From The Hill:In her petition, Bass laid out the nine symptoms of NPD, which are a grandiose sense of self-importance, a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, a belief that he or she is special and can only be understood by others with a similar status, a requirement of excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, interpersonal exploitation, lack of empathy, envy of others and arrogant or haughty behavior.Well, that definitely describes Trump s public behavior to the letter, and therefore Rep. Bass s request is completely justified. Hopefully, the GOP leadership heeds this warning and   even if it is done privately   has Trump evaluated, if for no other reason than the fact that they actually care about the American people they represent.You can sign this very important petition here at Change.org.Featured image via Joshua Lott/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Now the entire party is in jeopardy of imploding.Indeed, Trump s message is the poison that is delivering the final death blow to a once proud party and Mair was only too happy to admit it during an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN on Wednesday night. His message is being a loudmouthed d*ck, basically. And going out there and offending people and then engaging in an airing of grievances. That s what he does. He doesn t have another message. He doesn t have anything else that he wants to convey. The Republican Party has a message but it s not his message and he has no interest in carrying it.

Trump is merely taking it to it s final form and all of a sudden Republicans are acting horrified about it. But not so horrified that they aren t still willing to support him. And that s really the key here. Republicans can condemn his comments all they want. It doesn t mean a damn thing if they still support him as their nominee. Republicans created the hateful atmosphere that allowed Trump to rise in the first place. Their only redemption is to make sure he loses in November and just admit they were wrong and that they are going to seriously change their party this time around.

As it turns out, Clinton is leading the conservative-dream-come-true by 10 points, 49 percent to 39 percent, well above the margin of error (3 percent).The poll shows some very good news for Clinton: she s winning over the Obama coalition (which, as we all know, secured his reelection)When it comes to being  qualified  for the office of the presidency, Clinton leads Trump by 22 points (65-43).When it comes to the temperament to be President?

In fact, he used that very word when describing what s happening: The current race is which of these two is the more unacceptable, because right now neither of them is acceptable.Trump is helping [Hillary] to win by proving he is more unacceptable than she is. He also dropped this bomb on Trump s election chances: He cannot win the presidency operating the way he is now. [Hillary] can t be bad enough to elect him if he s determined to make this many mistakes. Now, Gingrich isn t saying he ll endorse or vote for Hillary. But he stopped being Trump s apologist for a moment, and is even one of the Republicans that s working on staging an intervention for Trump. They re hoping to get him to change course before the damage to their party is irreversible.Trump has also refused to endorse either Paul Ryan or John McCain in their re-election races, proving yet again that he would rather pick petty fights over imagined slights than actually focus on running for president. To Gingrich, he s still acting like it s primary season, and like he s still competing against 17 other candidates.Don t let Trump hear him say any of this, though! Gingrich so pansy-assed about this that he furiously tried to backpedal on Twitter.

It s basically recession-proof. You re doing lousy over here, by the way, I hate to tell you,  Trump declared.The Daily Beast reports:He then listed a number of factory closures, including Ball Corp., which was five hours away in Bristol, as far from Loudoun as you can get without leaving the state. And he mentioned the closure of a Smithfield Foods Inc. Anybody used to work for Smithfield?  he asked the crowd.It s almost certain none of them did. The Smithfield plant that closed was in Hampton Roads, Virginia three hours from Ashburn, in the southeast corner of the state.That wasn t The Donald s only mistake. He just kept opening his crazy mouth as if he was suffering from verbal diarrhea.He spoke of the closure of a plant owned by Invista, a Koch Industries company that produces fabric and carpeting, but that plant is located two hours away and it closed down eight years ago. And for the record, Obama was not the President 8 years ago. That needed to be pointed out since his spokeswoman Katrina Pierson seems to think Obama has been the leader of this country for over a decade.Trump also spoke about defense spending, however, thanks to its location, the county prides itself in bringing in big defense and aerospace business.But wait, there s more.Trump then spoke of Stanley Furniture  which he said closed down.  Stanley Furniture, however, is a plant based in North Carolina   which is totally not Virginia    but it did close in 2014. Loudoun County is so important,  he told the crowd after bashing its economy.

He s right. If someone lies about someone else, they should apologize. But that s not what happened here. They have not lied about him at all.

A black family alleges that an officer followed them home from picking up their seven-year old daughter, and held them at gunpoint for absolutely no reason other than they were black, and the father, Emmanuel Stephens, might have matched the description of a  suspicious black man  in the area. The family is suing for an unspecified amount in damages.The first question that many people will ask themselves when faced with a like this is, what did this family do that caused the officer to draw his gun?According the lawsuit, they did nothing, and it s that kind of question that perpetuates racism in the justice system, because nobody asks themselves that when the victim is white. Officer Alexander Keller followed them home, and then when they got out of their car, he got out of his and drew his gun. The officer also put Stephens in handcuffs and held him in the back of his patrol car for a while. Their car was searched, and Stephens was cited for possession of a small amount of pot, despite having it for medical reasons and producing a prescription to prove it.Worse, when their 14-year old daughter came out, she was threatened with a trip to Juvenile Hall if she went back to get her cell phone and record the whole sordid incident.Their lawyer said: What happened to my clients happens all the time and is a real problem.This type of police misconduct only gets attention when someone ends up dead, but this type of non-lethal harassment is much more widespread and also need to be brought to light and stopped. The department, however, says that there isn t any bias in their policing methods despite strong evidence to the contrary, and this situation would seem to be another piece of that evidence. Another cop later said that someone had reported a suspicious black man with a purple backpack in that area, but Stephens had no such backpack. Keller proceeded to profile him anyway.Even if Stephens did have such a backpack, there was no way for this officer to see that from his car when he decided to follow them, hold them at gunpoint, detain Stephens, and search their car without a warrant and without probable cause. Being black does not constitute probable cause.San Jose s police department is like many others, though. Black people are guilty until proven innocent, and are treated as such. Had this been a white family, and someone had reported a suspicious white man in their area, would Keller still have followed them home and drawn his gun on them? Searched their car without a warrant or evidence of wrongdoing? Cited him for medical marijuana for which he had a prescription?Very likely not.Featured image by David Paul Morris/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

While the mainstream media is focusing (and rightly so) on his vile comments aimed at a gold star family, his love affair with nuclear warheads, a crying baby at a Virginia rally, and his upcoming intervention, they are quiet about another story brewing.Trump Taj Mahal and Casino will be closing down, indefinitely, just after Labor Day as a union strike by members of Unite-HERE against the casino enters its 35th day. The union has said that there are no negotiations currently in the works and there are no scheduled negations for the future.In September 2014, a bankruptcy court allowed the hotel owners, Trump Entertainment Resorts, to eliminate the union members health insurance and pension plans. Trump and his business buddies contended that if the union members (which equated to roughly 1,000 members) did not meet those demands, the hotel would be closed. In December of the same year, the union and Trump  reached an agreement  and the hotel remained open, but it was also discovered that the hotel wasn t on the verge of closing because of the union, but because it did not receive the state and local tax breaks it was hoping for.Well the unions rightfully went on strike, starting on July 1, to protest against the sheer greed of Trump and his allies. It should be noted that Trump no longer owns or has a personal stake in the Taj Mahal since February 2016, giving up his power over the hotel and casino a mere five months ago. The hotel now belongs to Carl Icahn, a personal friend of the presidential candidate, who bailed out Trump Entertainment Resorts from bankruptcy   and this is the guy Trump will make Treasury Secretary should he win the presidency.Sounds like a real winner.It should also be noted that the shady business deals coming out of the Taj Mahal that the U.S. Department of the Treasury said was significant and long-standing money laundering violations  which would allow exploitation from criminals, terrorists, and other bad actors.  For that, they were given a $10 million civil fine.This hotel has been nothing but a headache for everyone who has ever been involved with it, Trump himself included. It was one of his bankruptcies, and the contractors who worked to make it all happen were stiffed. The stockholders were stiffed. The staff were stiffed.Trump s buddy Icahn, who s worth $17 billion, couldn t even keep it afloat.

Republicans should be ashamed of themselves and their party and if they truly care about America they will dump Trump. Sure, they would be giving the election away to Hillary Clinton by doing so, but at least there will be a nation left to govern.

Heck, even John McCain s granddaughter is voting for Hillary Clinton. It seems that with every passing day another Republican wakes up and realizes how truly damaging Trump is.Of course the Trump campaign denied such an intervention was in the works and pathetically tried to convince the public that the campaign was more unified than ever. Republicans are more scared that he will drop out of the race, something that seems very unlikely.As of right now, the Trump train has derailed and is heading on a crash course into a ditch.Can anyone remember a time in our American electoral history when a presidential candidate was forced to undergo an intervention to clean up his act? This is something completely unheard of, but lo and behold, it s happening right before our eyes.Remember when Republicans told us he would change his tune when he secured the delegates needed to be the nominee?

And her endorsement of Clinton isn t a  I guess I m with her  mentality, either   it s a full blown  Ready for Hillary  sentiment.Meg Whitman, a self made billionaire who didn t have any help from her daddy, posted a stinging denouncement of Trump on her Facebook.

She also praised Clinton for being an experienced, level-headed leader:As a proud Republican, casting my vote for President has usually been a simple matter. This year is different. To vote Republican out of party loyalty alone would be to endorse a candidacy that I believe has exploited anger, grievance, xenophobia and racial division.

Trump s unsteady hand would endanger our prosperity and national security. His authoritarian character could threaten much more.Therefore, I have decided to support Hillary Rodham Clinton. It is clear to me that Secretary Clinton s temperament, global experience and commitment to America s bedrock national values make her the far better choice in 2016 for President of the United States. In a tumultuous world, America needs the kind of stable and aspirational leadership Secretary Clinton can provide. I urge all Republicans to reject Donald Trump this November.Whitman, who is seen as a more moderate Republican given her positions of abortion, gay marriage and immigration, did the unthinkable: she put country over party.

Karl reported: This is absolutely unprecedented. First of all, I am told RNC chairman Reince Priebus is furious, that he has had multiple discussions with Trump telling him he needs to drastically change course. But here s the news, I am told senior officials at the party are actively exploring what would happen if Trump dropped out, how to replace him on the ballot. Karl noted that Trump cannot be forced out now that he has been officially named as the party s nominee, but he could solve the problem for them by dropping out all on his own. He would have to go out voluntarily, then it would be the 168 members of the RNC, through a complicated process, that would pick a new candidate,  Karl said.  It would have to happen by early September. George Stephanopoulos, host of Good Morning America, was stunned and asked if that was actually a possibility. Karl responded: He is so unpredictable right now, they are so unable to control his message, that they just don t know and clearly think it is a possibility, which is why they re looking at these rules. Regardless, the big-mouthed billionaire has managed to stay withing  shouting distance  of Hillary Clinton, which has caused the GOP to become even more enraged at his constant blunders.

She misstated what that director said about her emails. One top official told me if Trump had gone on vacation for the past two weeks, he would be in the lead.

We d know what Sarah thinks if she didn t spend the last few days b*tching about Hillary Clinton and avoiding the Khan family issue altogether.Unlike Meyer, much of the Right has followed Trump s disgusting example, even calling Khizr Khan an  agent  of the Muslim Brotherhood  perhaps to distract from the fact that he s actually managed to make the Pocket Constitution a bestseller, perhaps because he s a Muslim. Perhaps both, and any other number of batsh*t crazy reasons. They ve already jumped to  he was holding up the pocket SHARIA Constitution,  after all (I wish I was joking).Dakota Meyer   once again, the man who was crazy enough to marry Bristol Palin   has somehow become the Right s voice of reason.

AR-15s are a common choice for mass shooters, including the Orlando shooter, who killed 49 people, making it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. So, somehow, James Webb, the owner of the roofing company, thought his customers would love to get their hands on a free killing machine. We are the only roofing company in the country that is offering this we figured we take a stand on what we believe,  Webb said. We help people protect the outside, and now we empower people to protect the inside,  Webb said.Source: ABC7 ChicagoHere s the video:Yes, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Second Amendment means people can own guns, lots of guns if they want, but AR-15s are particularly deadly and basically unnecessary, unless you plan on heading to war.AR-15s were once banned in this country, but after the assault weapons ban expired in 2004, they became even easier to obtain than handguns. Some states have regulated assault weapons, such as the AR-15, but Colorado, while liberal in some areas, loves their guns and hates their gun laws. Only the city of Denver bans assault weapons.Image via Think ProgressThe bottom line, though, is that while AR-15s have benefitted from an incredible marketing campaign, including one that tries to redefine masculinity (apparently for those who are not sure of their masculinity), it s a military style weapon and there s almost no practical use. For hunting, it could blow the prey to bits and for self defense, it could blow a house to bits. Of course, a good way for a roofing company to get repeat business is to give people toys that will blow holes through the new roof.

I have such confidence in you. And I said,  Man, that s like big stuff. I always wanted to get the Purple Heart,  Donald continued.  This was much easier. At that point, Donald invited Dorfman to appear onstage with him on camera, so the two men then posed for photographs with Trump giving a thumbs-up before placing the Purple Heart back in his pocket.And none of this is weird (wink wink) after Donald s attacks on Humayun Khan s parents, whose son actually earned a Purple Heart. The Army Captain was remembered by soldiers who served with him as a selfless patriot.At any rate, Trump then told the crowd that he had asked Dorfman to speak, but that the man responded, saying,  No, sir.

While most of us think Trump s attempts to blame outside forces for his incompetence are pathetic, some of his most prominent minions are coming to his rescue to further spread his conspiracy theories.Roger Stone, one of Trump s closest confidantes, spoke to Breitbart bigot Milo Yiannopoulos recently and warned that there would be a  bloodbath  if Trump didn t win the election. After several recent polls have suggested that Clinton is pulling ahead of Trump, Stone was more than happy to declare voter fraud. Stone said: I think we have widespread voter fraud, but the first thing that Trump needs to do is begin talking about it constantly. If there s voter fraud, this election will be illegitimate, the election of the winner will be illegitimate, we will have a constitutional crisis, widespread civil disobedience, and the government will no longer be the government. Of course, Yiannopoulos was right on board with this theory and the men had some horrific advice for Trump   continue to be as offensive as possible and push those buttons so that he can gain enough rabid support from racists and bigots to make up for any supposed rigging that might happen. Stone also suggested that Trump should vow to shut the government down if Clinton was elected in November. As if this interview couldn t get any crazier, delusional Stone issued this warning: If you can t have an honest election, nothing else counts. I think he s gotta put them on notice that their inauguration will be a rhetorical, and when I mean civil disobedience, not violence, but it will be a bloodbath  We will not stand for it. Trump s allies are just like him   they love to encourage violence and are incapable of acting like adults when things don t go their way.

Smith ripped Trump and his followers a new one when he said: For a man to be able to publicly refer to a woman as a fat pig, that makes me teary. And for people to applaud, that is absolutely f*cking insanity to me. Smith specifically is making reference to Trump s comments about Rosie O Donnell, but we all know Trump s anti-women remarks go far beyond her. In the past, Trump has also attacked Arianna Huffington, calling her a  dog  and tweeting that she s  unattractive both inside and out.

It s absolutely collective insanity If one of my sons, I am getting furious just thinking about it, if one of my sons said that in a public place, they couldn t even live in my house anymore. Smith also went beyond Trump s misogyny and called the business mogul out for his bigoted rhetoric toward basically all minorities: I think as much as we want to believe that love is the greatest human motivator, it s not. Fear is. Fear is the most dangerous and powerful motivator because when a human being gets scared, fight or flight kicks in. And there is this really separatist non-inclusive xenophobic, racist wave that is sweeping the globe that is making us pull apart farther than putting us together.The importance of leaders is that they have to be level headed, they have to be calm, because when people get scared, they lose their morality and that reptile mind takes over. It s the type of thing that you see in all forms of nature, but our leaders can t be that. For Smith, the only comfort he has in the midst of Trump s hateful campaign is his belief in America to know better than to elect the former reality TV star. Once again shaming Trump for his remarks about women, Smith said: For me, deep down in my heart, I believe that America won t and we can t (elect Mr. Trump).

His behavior and big mouth have caused many Americans to say that Trump is not fit for public office, especially an office as powerful as the presidency, which has access to the nuclear weapons codes.And according to Dr. Drew, who is a board certified internist and a Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, Americans are right to worry.During an interview with Don Lemon on CNN, Dr. Drew explained that he doesn t think Trump is necessarily insane. There s two definitions of sanity, one is legal definition, and that is somebody who is so out of it they don t know the difference between right and wrong. That is a very high standard for insanity, very few people meet that standard. When you re legally insane, you re really not functioning. Clinically, medically, usually when we talk about insanity, we mean psychotic, hearing voices, hallucinations. But he did concede that Trump is showing signs of mental instability. The question, though, is, are some of the reckless qualities that everyone is getting so disturbed about on the campaign going to be translated into office should he get elected? That s a pretty hard thing to predict. I don t know if this is just somebody playing politics, or is this somebody who really can t contain their impulses?

I never expect to agree with whoever is president, but at a minimum the president needs to consistently display those qualities I have preached to my two children: kindness, honesty, dignity, compassion and respect.I do not expect perfection, but I do require more than the embodiment of at least a short list of the seven deadly sins.Then Hanna slammed the Republican Party for alienating a large swath of Americans while becoming incapable of nominating a candidate who is electable:I have long held the belief that the Republican Party is becoming increasingly less capable of nominating a person who is electable as president. The primary process is so geared toward the party s political base, which ignores the fact that we have largely alienated women, Hispanics, the LGBT community, young voters and many others in general.Hanna went on to call Trump  deeply flawed  and blasted him for the way he has treated John McCain and for the way he is treating Humayun Khan s family now. Hanna is ashamed that his party continues to still support Trump even though he is insulting military families and veterans across the country.And that why he is throwing his support   and most importantly, his vote -to Hillary Clinton.Secretary Clinton has issues that depending on where one stands can be viewed as great or small. But she stands and has stood for causes bigger than herself for a lifetime. That matters. Mrs. Clinton has promoted many of the issues I have been committed to over the years including expanding education and supporting women s health care.While I disagree with her on many issues, I will vote for Mrs. Clinton. I will be hopeful and resolute in my belief that being a good American who loves his country is far more important than parties or winning and losing. I trust she can lead. All Republicans may not like the direction, but they can live to win or lose another day with a real candidate. Our response to the public s anger and the need to rebuild requires complex solutions, experience, knowledge and balance. Not bumper sticker slogans that pander to our disappointment, fear and hate.Now that one Republican in Congress has the balls to vote for Hillary in rejection of Trump, how many others will do the same?Featured image via Sara D.

Of course, the crowd cheered enthusiastically. But when she continued, their mood quickly did an about face: Time and time again, [Donald] Trump has disrespected our nation s armed forces and veterans. And his disrespect for Mr. Khan  That was as far as she got before the crowd became vicious, booing her so fiercely that they drowned out her words. Why are you here?  one woman screamed angrily. But Byrne continued to speak You ve got a son in the military, how do you tolerate this disrespect? Pence finally stepped in after about 10 seconds and began to hush the crowd. That s OK,  he said. Pence then reiterated what he and said when he was confronted by protesters in Ohio last week: That s what freedom looks like, and that s what freedom sounds like. Pence then praised Capt. Humayun Khan and his family. Khan was killed in Iraq while serving in the United States military. His parents made headlines when they appeared at the Democratic National Convention and blasted Trump for his anti-Muslim rhetoric. The Republican nominee responded to Khizr Khan s criticism of his bigoted policies by attack them. Capt. Khan is an American hero and we honor him and honor his family,  he said.  The story of Capt. Khan is an incredibly inspiring story. But in the next breath, Pence defended Trump. I have never been around someone more devoted to the armed forces of this country,  Pence said of Trump.  There is no one more devoted to the veterans in this country. One of the people booing Byrne was Denise Martinez. She said that she admired how Pence had dealt with the tense situation. I thought he handled it really, really well,  she said.  Looking back, I think I would ve taken the high road. He handled it the right way, the way I wish Trump would have,  she added.Barbara Weisenthal was another woman who was booing. In her opinion, Khizr Khan had no right  to speak about Trump the way he did at the DNC and his entire speech  was almost like slander. Weisenthal added that the rally was  probably not the best place  for Byrne to ask her question.Jack Christenson, who is a veteran himself, argued that even though Byrne had the right to speak out thanks to the Constitution, she didn t have the right  to violate everyone else s rights  by asking a question of a person running to be vice president.Roen Horn said Byrne was claiming that Trump was  somehow insulting the veterans,  which he said was  a bunch of crap.

Of course, he doesn t see it that way at all. He s a raving success for his entire life, and his failures are just lies made up by the evil, liberal, mainstream media.Trump University is more evidence of the above because he scammed thousands of students out of thousands of dollars each. He s done all kinds of weaseling about that, but the fact remains that Trump U. was a scam and students were left on the hook for their money and without learning anything useful, like Trump s path to riches and glory.A few days ago, Trump was asked specifically what he gave up for his country that was in any way comparable to a soldier giving up his life. He seriously thinks that he gave up as much as Captain Khan and every other soldier who s ever died, and their families, in creating those thousands of jobs he likes to brag about.He also thinks that donations are this huge sacrifice, and actually said he works very, very hard, bragged about his tremendous success,  and talked up the fact that he thinks he s done a lot here. The truth is, General Draft Dodger McSmallhands created all those jobs, built all those structures, and made all those donations to enrich himself. Whatever benefits there were to society are side deals to him.And if people are hurt when his deals go south? Too bad for them, it seems.As for the future of the GOP, well, he s sounded their death knell. They re too cowardly to stand up to him and his gross insults of Gold Star families, and most of America is outraged over both Trump s statements and the GOP s lack of meaningful censure.So those are the sacrifices that Trump has really made oh wait.

When asked how he d respond if his daughter, Ivanka, was being harassed the way that Ailes harassed many women, his answer was positively vile.Kirsten Powers, a Fox News contributor and USA Today columnist, pointedly asked Trump that very question. His reply? I would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case. Because it should always be incumbent upon the woman to handle the situation quietly, instead of her harasser s responsibility to, oh, we don t know, maybe not harass women. Novel idea, yes? Trump literally just said he wouldn t want his daughter to report it, to complain, to fight for herself, or to out her harasser. From there, given his defense of Ailes and his own proclivity towards womanizing and harassment, we can assume that he expects her to work to avoid ruining her harasser s career and life at all costs.Just over a week ago, Trump told NBC s Chuck Todd the following: Some of the women that are complaining, I know how much he s helped them Now, all of a sudden, they re saying these horrible things about him. Piling on a bandwagon, in his opinion? Perhaps. Maybe he thinks they re jaded because Ailes passed them over for promotion, or worse, because Ailes didn t hit on them, but hit on other women in front of them and they were jealous. The mind of a misogynist can create all kinds of theories as to why women would dare ruin a career as obviously stellar as that of Roger Ailes.Most women can t just up and quit their jobs because they re being harassed. Even if they all could, they should absolutely not be expected to. Why? Because the harassment is not their fault, and it should be on their harasser to go find a new damn job. It s the harasser who was wrong.Ivanka stands by her father in his bid for the presidency, and he should not be telling her to tuck tail and run in the face of harassment, as if the harassment is her fault.

Sally Bradshaw, a top adviser to Jeb Bush, announced on Monday that she is leaving the Republican Party, and furthermore, if the race is close in Florida she plans to cast her vote for Hillary Clinton.Bradshaw, who was a top advisor to Bush during his 2016 campaign, has now officially changed her registration to unaffiliated rather than Republican. In an email interview, she told CNN s Jamie Gangel that the GOP is at a crossroads and have nominated a total narcissist   a misogynist   a bigot. This is a time when country has to take priority over political parties. Donald Trump cannot be elected president,  Bradshaw said.Bradshaw has a long history with the Bush family, having begun her career in 1988 working for George H.W. Bush s campaign. She has now joined the ranks of  many other prominent Republicans who are staunchly refusing to jump on the Trump Train. Bradshaw said: This election cycle is a test. As much as I don t want another four years of (President Barack) Obama s policies, I can t look my children in the eye and tell them I voted for Donald Trump. I can t tell them to love their neighbor and treat others the way they wanted to be treated, and then vote for Donald Trump. I won t do it. Her departure comes on the heels of Trump s revolting comments about the parents of a Muslim-American soldier who sacrificed his life in Iraq while fighting for the United States military. Bradshaw said his remarks were revolting and made me sick to my stomach.  She continued: Donald Trump belittled a woman who gave birth to a son who died fighting for the United States. If anything, that reinforced my decision to become an independent voter. Every family who loses a loved one in service to our country or who has a family member who serves in the military should be honored, regardless of their political views. Vets and their family have more than earned the right to those views. Someone with the temperament to be president would understand and respect that. Bradshaw said Trump s most recent comment was the proverbial straw that broke the camel s back, however, leaving the GOP is something she had been contemplating for awhile. I ve been considering the switch for months. Ultimately, I could not abide the hateful rhetoric of Donald Trump and his complete lack of principles and conservative philosophy. I didn t make this decision lightly   I have worked hard to make our party a place where all would feel welcome. But Trump has taken the GOP in another direction, and too many Republicans are standing by and looking the other way. She served as Jeb Bush s campaign manager both times he ran for governor of Florida. She said she hasn t made up her mind who she plans to vote for, but it obviously won t be Trump. I haven t made a decision yet between Clinton, Gary Johnson or writing in a candidate. If the race in Florida is close, I will vote for Hillary Clinton. That is a very difficult statement for me to make. I disagree with her on several important issues. I have worked to elect Republicans to national and statewide offices for the last 30 years. I have never voted for a Democrat for president, and I consider myself a conservative, a supporter of limited government, gun rights, free enterprise, equality of opportunity. I am pro-life. There are no other candidates who were serious contenders for the nomination that I would not have supported. Bradley faults Trump s presidential competitors for not coming out strong enough against him earlier in the campaign season. I really fault the candidates who did not speak out against Trump until the end of the primary cycle. Lindsay Graham and Jeb Bush spoke out early and consistently   but most did not, fearful of offending that segment of the party or positioning themselves for future office. Bradshaw insists that it is  the only real choice for reasonable, thoughtful Republicans to make. Our president must represent what is good about America   a belief in opportunity for all   regardless of race and gender and background   to rise up and live the American dream. A president can t tear down Hispanics, or mock someone who is disabled, or use symbols in campaign literature that Jewish voters understandably find offensive. To continue to be the hope of the world, all Americans regardless of party affiliation have to reject him. She added: If and when the party regains its sanity, I ll be ready to return. But until Republicans send a message to party leadership that this cannot stand, nothing will ever change. Truer words were never spoken. The GOP is no longer the party of conservatism. It is the party of Trumpism.Featured image via Joshua Lott/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Ours is a sacrifice you will never know. Ours is a sacrifice we would never want you to know.Your recent comments regarding the Khan family were repugnant, and personally offensive to us. When you question a mother s pain, by implying that her religion, not her grief, kept her from addressing an arena of people, you are attacking us. When you say your job building buildings is akin to our sacrifice, you are attacking our sacrifice.You are not just attacking us, you are cheapening the sacrifice made by those we lost.You are minimizing the risk our service members make for all of us.This goes beyond politics. It is about a sense of decency. That kind decency you mock as  political correctness. We feel we must speak out and demand you apologize to the Khans, to all Gold Star families, and to all Americans for your offensive, and frankly anti-American, comments.We hope you will hear us.Sincerely,Diane and Neil Santoriello, Mother and Father of 1LT Neil Santoriello, KIA, IraqSummer Lipford-Mickelson, Mother, Frederick Sirko, Father, Kirby Mickelson, Stepfather, Laura Sirko Samimy and Bridget Sirko Gentle, Sisters of PFC Steven Sirko, KIA, Iraq.Sue and Randy Loudon, Mother and Father of 2ndLt.

Khan, many probably expected the GOP to hop on board and repudiate Trump. After all, insulting those who fight to keep us safe from terrorism is just sick and wrong.It seems now that we ll all be waiting a long time to hear them do that. House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have indeed issued statements against Trump, but they re so weak and watery that they re meaningless, empty gestures.McConnell said: Captain Khan was an American hero, and like all Americans I m grateful for the sacrifices that selfless young men like Capt. Khan and their families have made in the war on terror. All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services. And as I have long made clear, I agree with the Khans and families across the country that a travel ban of all members of a religion is simply contrary to American values. Some of that is word-salady enough to make us tilt our heads and think,  Say what?  Ultimately, though, McConnell got what he deserved from the Twitterverse. They see right through the meaninglessness of this statement, particularly because it s paired with the GOP s continuing endorsement of Trump.    Paul Ryan s statement wasn t much better. He said:  America s greatness is built on the principles of liberty and preserved by the men and women who wear the uniform to defend it. As I have said on numerous occasions, a religious test for entering our country is not reflective of these fundamental values. I reject it. Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example. His sacrifice and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan should always be honored. Period. His statement is clearer, but no less empty than McConnell s. Twitter saw right through him, too.     Given that Trump has since insulted both Khizr and his wife publicly, instead of apologizing to a grieving family for his cold-hearted fuckery, it s more important than ever for the GOP to publicly reject him. In fact, Khizr has pleaded with them to do just that. They won t, though. These statements make that clear.The only way for Republicans to prove that Trump doesn t speak for them on this issue is to directly and bluntly reject him, since he obviously doesn t represent American values. They should have done this months ago, and they didn t because they re impotent. Now they re stuck supporting Trump, which makes them the party of all the hate Trump spews forth from his black and shriveled soul.Image of Paul Ryan by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.

One of Trump s surrogates, Scottie Nell Hughes, tried to use this tactic during a segment on CNN s New Day on Sunday morning.The father, Khizr Khan, spoke at the Democratic National Convention, where he called out Trump for his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Khan said during his speech that Trump has sacrificed nothing or no one in his life.Trump, a billionaire, responded by saying: I think I ve made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I ve had tremendous success. I think I ve done a lot. This response came out during an interview with George Stephanopoulos.Hughes says that she was initially disappointed with Trump s comments about Khan. However, once she realized that the interview was a part of the media s agenda to make Trump look bad, which is apparently something he could never do on his own in the mind of a Trump supporter, she has to tell people the truth   it s all a giant media conspiracy. Now that I ve read the questions and the Trump campaign and others have released the full transcript, you can see what a setup this is. Which was nothing but to trap Mr. Trump going forward. The truth is that Trump is trapped. He is trapped by the vile rhetoric that he has spewed throughout the primary election. He went full fascist and it is preventing him from being able to effectively pivot more to the middle in order to win the votes he needs to win a general election.Hughes, like many other Trump supporters, are in for a rude awakening when if they are capable of doing so   they realize that they backed a losing candidate.You can watch Hughes desperately try to rationalize Trump s horrendous comments below.#Trump to #KhizrKhan \""I've made a lot of sacrifices\"" @VictorBlackwell gets reax from @scottienhughes @asbthelawhttps://t.co/imMsHa8ARQ  New Day (@NewDay) July 31, 2016Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

So naturally, Trump decided to attack her silence, insisting she held her tongue because she was MuslimGhazala Khan wrote a scathing response to the billionaire bully that was published in Sunday s edition of the Washington Post.Donald Trump has asked why I did not speak at the Democratic convention. He said he would like to hear from me. Here is my answer to Donald Trump: Because without saying a thing, all the world, all America, felt my pain. I am a Gold Star mother. Whoever saw me felt me in their heart.She wrote of how much her son, Humayun Khan, loved his country and how brave he was. She told of how, like every soldier s mother, she worried for his safety. She said that as he got on the plane for his deployment, he gave her strength. Don t worry, Mom. Everything will be all right,  he had told her.Mother s Day 2004 was the last time Ghazala got to speak with her son. She had begged him to be safe and he told her, Mom, these are my soldiers, these are my people. I have to take care of them.  He was taking care of his men when he died. He went to investigate a suspicious vehicle and was killed by a car bomb, but only after telling his everyone else to stay back and take cover.She said that her son always wanted to help people, something he did by volunteering to teach swim classes for people with disabilities at a local hospital. She added that he had wanted to follow in his father s footsteps and become a lawyer. To this day, Ghazala said she is unable to walk into a room with pictures of the middle son she lost. Walking onto the convention stage, with a huge picture of my son behind me, I could hardly control myself,  she wrote.  What mother could? Donald Trump has children whom he loves. Does he really need to wonder why I did not speak? Ghazala then spoke directly to the Republican nominee as she concluded.Donald Trump said that maybe I wasn t allowed to say anything. That is not true. My husband asked me if I wanted to speak, but I told him I could not. My religion teaches me that all human beings are equal in God s eyes. Husband and wife are part of each other; you should love and respect each other so you can take care of the family.Donald Trump said he has made a lot of sacrifices.

However, he crossed a major line in his accusations, and it has already come back to bite him hard.In an interview with ABC News, he made the following ridiculous claim: Well, I ll tell you what I don t like. It s against two NFL games. I got a letter from the NFL saying,  This is ridiculous. Why are the debates against   cause the NFL doesn t wanna go against the debates.  Cause the debates are gonna be pretty massive, from what I understand, OK? And I don t think we should be against the NFL. Now, aside from the obvious questions of why the NFL would be sending Trump a letter about this, rather than the Commission on Presidential Debates, it appears that this is one of Trump s most blatant lies yet. CNN s Brian Stetler says the NFL responded by disavowing any contact with Trump at all: While we d obviously wish the debate commission could find another night, we did not send a letter to Trump. And there it is. Most politicians who are given to lies will at least attempt to lie in such a way that it s hard to prove, even with a statement from whomever or whatever they re lying about. Not Trump! No he s so important that it doesn t matter that the debate schedule has been in place for a year already. Agencies like the NFL will communicate to him first, because he s just that crucial to the whole process.Why is this significant? Because it s not a gaffe. A gaffe is when a politician, pundit, or someone else heavily involved in politics accidentally lets loose what s really on their minds. Romney s 47 percent comment four years ago is a gaffe. Trump, however, commits gaffes and also tells outright lies. And because of that, it s virtually pointless to fact-check him, because even with a statement from whoever he s lied about, he ll double down on it.If nothing else, this lie, while seemingly stupid, provides a deep look into the psyche of the man who is Donald Trump. He ll say whatever he wants   he doesn t care. And if the NFL wants to take him down a notch or twelve by denying they even communicated with him, then he ll make sure they re sorry for making him look like the fool that he is.

As if that wasn t bad enough, Trump then offers the only reason his brain can come up with as to why the fire marshal might be enforcing regulations that were created probably long before his clown show rolled into town.

Having such a video on his work computer is a violation of Nebraska law, but it appears that Governor Ricketts and Kintner both ignored the law and hid the investigation from the public since last November when the discovery of the video was made.Only on Friday did Ricketts actually publicly call for Kintner to resign. Due to the ongoing investigation of this issue, I have been unable to say anything publicly. If the allegations are true, Senator Kintner needs to resign. The violation and the cover-up has Democrats calling for more than just Kintner s resignation. It is not enough for Sen. Kintner to resign in shame. Anyone that knew this information and continued to let him sit in office must also resign,  Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb said in a statement.  Did Gov. Ricketts or his staff look the other way so they had (Kintner s) vote in the Unicameral? This is so serious, in fact, that the State Patrol has turned out their findings to the Accountability and Disclosure Commission and and ethics investigation is underway.This is also incredibly hypocritical considering Kintner constantly brags about being a conservative  Christian  who has urged Christian-owned businesses to provide gay customers bad service on purpose and once told the Journal Star that his parents  taught me the moral absolutes of Christianity, and I just applied those to everything.

Lelania Chapman was hiking through the woods after seven months of cancer treatments when she stumbled upon four teenage boys who were stranded on a cliff. I ve never been in a situation like that before and you never know what you are going to be like,  Chapman, who had stayed home during the bulk of her treatments, told TODAY.  No matter what, you are a lot stronger than you think you are. For the bulk of her treatments, this amazing woman stayed home, only leaving to go to the doctor. But after her final treatment, she took her 9-year-old son and three neighborhood children on a waterfall hike near her home outside of Vancouver, Canada   despite receiving bad news from doctors that more tumors had appeared and her cancer had spread. Instead of focusing on the negatives she not only was able to show her son and the other children a good time, but she became an unlikely hero when an 11-year-old girl in her group thought she heard someone shouting. Chapman didn t hear it at first, but after investigating they found the teens trapped on a rock by the falls, their lips purple from the cold.Chapman tried to call for help, but there was no cellular service. She started to walk back to her truck to attempt to get service but she heard one of the boys cry  I just want my mom.  Deciding that she couldn t leave them there and despite being weakened from months of cancer treatments, Chapman leaped into action. Some people say it s a mother s instinct,  she told TODAY. Chapman grabbed a rope from her backpack and climbed down the ravine to get closer to the boys. They then tossed her a length of their own rope, which she tied to the biggest tree she could find, wrapped it around her waist, and tossed it back to the boys. The biggest of the teens, who stands about 6 feet tall and weighs about 160 pounds climbed up first to help rescue the others. Despite her smaller frame due to losing weight from the cancer treatments, Chapman (who had difficulty lifting a watermelon at this point) managed to pull him up. I don t know how I picked him up by myself,  she said.  I don t really know to this day.  Chapman bashed her knee and some of the radiation burns and scars from her treatment tore open from the strain, but the heroic mom gave into her  mama bear  instincts and pulled the boys up one by one. When only the smallest of the boys was left, she feared her rope might break. But Chapman didn t give up. She laid on her belly and talked to the final teen, who told her he was just going to jump. I told him it wasn t a good idea and if he jumped, I would have to jump, and he just really needed to trust me,  she said. Ultimately, the team was able to pull him up. She walked with the teens to the parking lot, where she called their mothers.As Chapman made dinner later, a 7-year-old girl from her group said something incredibly inspirational: Yep, that s just what we do. We fight cancer and save boys. This experience has greatly impacted her son, Gwindin. Though Chapman has a long battle ahead of her, Gwindin is no longer scared: He said  You know what, mom? You are going to [beat] cancer because you are the strongest mom around,'  she said.  That is probably one of the most important lessons that I learned that day. I do have the strength. Here are some photos of Chapman proving that a mother s ability to transform into an almost superhuman protector is not at all a myth:  A GoFundMe page set up to help pay for expenses related to Chapman s future cancer treatments has raised half of its $15,000 goal.

The record thus makes obvious that the  problem  the majority in the general assembly sought to remedy was emerging support for the minority party.

I like people who weren t captured,  Trump said about John McCain, who was tortured to the point where he is incapable of lifting his arms above his shoulders.John McCain is a war hero and Donald Trump insulted him and every other American veteran who has ever been a POW.Fast-forward a year later and Trump is now the Republican nominee, and Caroline McCain has made her decision to go from being #NeverTrump to declaring her support for Hillary Clinton.In an amazing post on Medium, Caroline McCain took Donald Trump to the woodshed.Following a line of other right-wing wacko birds, Trump insulted a man I esteem and love, a man who has risked his life in service of his country. He insulted my grandfather and attacked the very qualities loyalty, bravery and selflessness that he and countless other POWs embody. He mocked the sacrifice many have given and the anguish families have endured when their heroes have suffered alone miles away.My grandfather responded with grace and forgiveness as only a man who was held in captivity for years can. But I ve been nursing a grudge ever since. Trump s statement, in my view, is unforgivable, and speaks to the kind of man he is: a coward who has never faced danger in his life, an insecure brat who shirked duty for comfort, and a man who is wholly unfit to serve as commander-in-chief.Indeed, while John McCain was suffering in Vietnam for his country, Donald Trump dodged the draft and never saw a day of military service in his entire life.And Caroline McCain wasn t done ripping him a new one.He lacks the temperament and the wisdom to navigate our ever-increasingly dangerous world. Policy decisions aside, being President of the United States requires a steady hand and never more so than now. A competent commander-in-chief must respond to threats to the Republic, but Trump only responds to threats to his ego.She goes on to trace her journey to becoming a Hillary supporter, and one of the moments that helped her make her decision was when President Obama spoke at the DNC Convention earlier this week.He could have pointed blame at the GOP for enabling Trump s rise. He could have taken party leadership to task for falling in line behind Trump. But he didn t. He instead presented the election as a choice between democracy and demagogue. He gave Republicans the option to abandon Trump rather than blaming them for his rise.There are so many things I disagree with President Obama on, but this is a moment I will always respect him for. And maybe this was the moment I needed to fully own the choice I would have to make in November.McCain then ripped the Republican Party for betraying her and others by supporting a racist homophobic misogynist who only cares about himself.The party chose for its king a demagogue who wears a wig instead of a crown, and a celebrity in pursuit of fame and fortune rather than service and sacrifice Loyalty to party can never trump loyalty to country. And loyalty to party means nothing when the party has been poisoned.And because the Republican Party is poisoned, Caroline McCain wants Trump to lose by a landslide in November to force the GOP to change, which is why she is voting for Hillary.I wanted a different candidate. I wanted a New American Century. I wanted an election with good ideas and good discourse. I wanted to win. But now I want my party to change. I want fresh leaders, of good character, in both parties. And I want Donald Trump to be humiliated in November and driven far from the political arena for the rest of his life.So I m not a Democrat at least not yet. But this year, I m With Her.The Republican Party should be very afraid right now. Because if John McCain s own conservative granddaughter is willing to vote for Hillary to defeat Trump, surely there are many other Republicans out there who are willing to do the same.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

While both Hillary and Trump are slated to start getting intelligence briefings now that they ve formally accepted their parties  nominations, many intelligence officials are very wary of briefing Trump.

He s been so uninterested in the truth and so reckless with it when he sees it. Boom! That s an indictment of Trump s trustworthiness if there ever was one.The official is understandably concerned with Trump s comments about Vladimir Putin, but in addition to that, he s noticed that Trump doesn t want to actually learn anything about, well, anything. He s absurdly stuck on what he thinks are his own merits, and nobody s going to dissuade him from his preconceived notions.Not even intelligence officials.The issue is so volatile and so controversial that the reason these officials talked to the Post on the condition of anonymity was just so they could comment on this. They re that upset with his plea to Russia to hack Hillary s emails, which Trump and his campaign later dismissed as sarcasm and as a call to Russia to turn over any emails they already had. It s clear the intelligence community isn t buying either of those sorry excuses.Some in the intelligence community are also a little wary of Hillary, but Trump is the one who is the loose cannon he claims Hillary is. At least Hillary has extensive experience with intelligence briefings that are far more specific than she ll get as a presidential candidate. Trump has none, and there s absolutely no way, whatsoever, to know how he d handle such information. It s particularly frightening if he thinks that information is juicy; he d probably put it on Twitter for all to see.The official that won t brief Trump said that it s entirely possible Trump will refuse those briefings, because he  already knows all that.  Given that Trump s ego is the size of Russia and growing big enough to make his tiny hands microscopic by comparison, it s not likely he ll refuse them because those briefings will make him feel important.And nothing is more important to Trump than feeling important.Members of the intelligence community aren t the only people worried about Trump getting intelligence briefings. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid flat-out said he hopes that they ll give Trump fake briefings because he s so untrustworthy. Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) called on President Obama to deny those briefings to Trump altogether.Considering those briefings happen at the discretion of the sitting president, Obama could very well do it.

The reason? He wants WikiLeaks, at the behest of Russia, to undermine Clinton and help him get elected.Well today, it s been confirmed that the Clinton campaign s computer system have been hacked   and the Russians were probably the ones who did it.U.S. intelligence officials have found evidence clearly linking state-sponsored Russian hackers to breaches in multiple Democratic affiliated organizations, including the fundraising Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Democratic National Committee. The Clinton campaign has now been added to the triangle of breaches.Reuters broke the story Friday afternoon, receiving no comment from the Department of Justice nor any Russian officials. When reaching out for comment, Reuters wrote:The Clinton campaign, based in Brooklyn, had no immediate comment and referred Reuters to a comment from earlier this week by campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan criticizing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and calling the hacking  a national security issue. Reuters has also no knowledge of what specifically had been breached in the Clinton computer system.Maybe it s the emails Trump and his buddies at the Kremlin have been hoping for. Given Trump s public ignorance of knowing Putin   even though he has acknowledged in the past he does in fact know him very well   it seems the timing of this new hack against Clinton is very coincidental.Also given Trump s strange admiration for Putin and apparently for individuals that hack, a lopsided influence in the United States Presidential election in favor of him also seems very coincidental given the circumstances just now coming to light.By saying he hoped Russians hacked Hillary Clinton   which he tweeted and said on camera so it really isn t a  joke  to him   Trump has made clear that he is perfectly A-OK with victory based on cheating an treasonous associations.It s one thing to joke   it s another to have your Motherland thugs (who clearly support you) spring into action on your behalf.Whether or not Trump and his campaign clowns are involved (directly) in this remains to be seen. Whether or not Trump and his campaign clowns are involved indirectly remains to be seen.

Her speech portrayed her accurately as a candidate far more qualified to lead America than Donald Trump, and broke down the barriers with not only Bernie Sanders supporters, but Republican voters as well.Clinton s acceptance speech was a massive success for those reasons alone, but something even more surreal was taking place  we all witnessed an historic moment as Clinton had shattered America s highest glass ceiling by becoming the first woman to be nominated by a major party. And the sad thing was, that while Clinton set new ground for women in America, all conservatives could do was complain about her voice and appearance.Apparently, nothing brings out blatant GOP sexism like a strong, intelligent, accomplished woman achieving something monumental. Instead of recognizing that history was literally being made before our very eyes, conservatives made sure to take Clinton down a notch by insulting her on the most minor things. One of the first sexism offenses came from Brit Hume on Fox News, who reduced Clinton to her voice and mouth when he said: She has a habit, when speaking, of breaking into a kind of a sharp, lecturing tone, makes you feel like. She has a great asset, as a public person, which is a radiant smile, but she has a not so attractive voice.

You know what this convention really needed? An angry Muslim with a thick accent like Fareed Zacaria,  Coulter wrote on Twitter. Of course, even conservatives slammed Coulter for her shameful words.But Rios, who works for the American Family Association hate organization, went further than Coulter by questioning Khan s loyalty to America and even had the gall to question the loyalty of his son, who died for this country to save the American soldiers under his command in Iraq. If you are so concerned, Mr. Khan, if you re an American first, then distinguish yourself and condemn Islamists, condemn the Muslim Brotherhood, then we will listen to you, and stop waving the Constitution,  Rios said before claiming that Muslims cannot truly practice Islam and live under the Constitution and accusing Khan of lying. As far as I can tell, Islam, truly, supporters of Islam and the Quran, cannot embrace the Constitution. Now, if you have a different view, then explain that to us and then maybe we can be persuaded, but don t shame America for having genuine and rightful concerns about Muslims in our midst when we have no idea who they are or what they really believe, and we re not even sure about you, sir, because we know about taqiyya, which is the practice of lying to the infidel in order to advance the Muslim cause. First of all, this man lost his son in Iraq so it s safe to say he condemns terrorists. What Rios is employing is the Trump and Republican claim that simply saying the words  radical Islam  will magically make ISIS disappear and they are claiming that anyone who doesn t say it isn t a real patriot.Donald Trump made that same claim when he questioned President Obama s loyalty to America back in June in the wake of the Orlando mass shooting. Look, we re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he s got something else in mind,  Trump told Fox News.  There s something going on. It s inconceivable. There s something going on. He doesn t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands   it s one or the other and either one is unacceptable. But Rios didn t stop there. She also questioned the loyalty of Khan s son Humayun, who proudly wore the uniform and flag of this country and posthumously received the Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his heroic actions on the day he was killed. So I m sorry, we ll not be shamed. I m sorry for the loss of their son and I hope he is a loyal American. But I think a loyal American Muslim would be more like Zuhdi Jasser, who is very clear about where he stands, who was very patriotic and loyal and totally distances himself from Islamism, so if that s the case for this gentleman, then he should ve said that on the platform rather than shaming us for having concerns about Muslim immigration. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch.I would say that this is a new low for conservatives but they have already hit rock bottom. The fact is that members of ISIS WANT us to refer to them as followers of Islam because they want legitimacy. But they are not real followers of Islam. They have simply co-opted the religion in an effort to justify their violent cause and they do not represent the over one billion peaceful Muslims in the world. Basically, Rios expects every Muslim to take a loyalty oath, which is exactly what Donald Trump wants to do to any Muslim seeking refuge within our shores.This is pure hate and bigotry and it has no place in our society. If anyone is violating the Constitution it is the likes of Rios and Trump who think that only Christianity is protected by it. But the Constitution protects freedom of religion. That means all religions, even Islam.And Rios should be removed from the airwaves for even suggesting that Khan and his son are not loyal to this country. He and his son have sacrificed more for this country than she ever has or ever will.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The law also cut early voting, ended same day registration, and heavily restricted pre-registration of young voters. It has been the most draconian anti-voting law in the country, and has drawn massive protests ever since.Critics of the law challenged it s constitutionality in court, only to see the district court rule against them. But now a federal appeals court has not only reversed the lower court s decision, it slammed them. In holding that the legislature did not enact the challenged provisions with discriminatory intent, the court seems to have missed the forest in carefully surveying the many trees,  Judge Diana Motz wrote in the decision.  This failure of perspective led the court to ignore critical facts bearing on legislative intent, including the inextricable link between race and politics in North Carolina. And then Motz roundly condemned the Republican-dominated state legislature of North Carolina. The General Assembly enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans,  she wrote, stressing that the court did their homework which led to their ruling.In response to claims that intentional racial discrimination animated its action, the State offered only meager justifications. Although the new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision, they constitute inapt remedies for the problems assertedly justifying them and, in fact, impose cures for problems that did not exist. Thus the asserted justifications cannot and do not conceal the State s true motivation.Faced with this record, we can only conclude that the North Carolina General Assembly enacted the challenged provisions of the law with discriminatory intent. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court to the contrary and remand with instructions to enjoin the challenged provisions of the law. We recognize that elections have consequences, but winning an election does not empower anyone in any party to engage in purposeful racial discrimination.  Motz concluded.Here s the full decision via Talking Points Memo:This is a major victory for voting rights in this country and a humiliating defeat for Republicans who really thought they could suppress the votes of millions of Americans and get away with it just because they gained power in the state.Now Democrats have a fair chance to not only oust these Republicans and take back the state government of North Carolina, the voters who just got their voting rights restored will get a chance to vote in November just in time to participate in what will be a historical election.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Our country s motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto?  the former Secretary of State asked Americans before going after Donald Trump s agenda of fear and division. Well, we heard Donald Trump s answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us   from the rest of the world, and from each other.He s betting that the perils of today s world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He s taken the Republican Party a long way  from  Morning in America  to  Midnight in America.  He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than eighty years ago, during a much more perilous time.  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Hillary went on to slam Trump for claiming that he alone can fix America and blasted him for claiming that he will put America first, which led to one of the best passages of the night. He also talks a big game about putting America First. Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again   well, he could start by actually making things in America again. The Democratic nominee also questioned Trump s temperament to be president, which also led to one of the best lines of the night. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he s gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he s challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. Indeed, and Trump not only lost his cool during Clinton s speech, he clearly went to bed enraged because he continued throwing a temper tantrum on Friday morning with a series of tweets attacking just about anyone, including the media, Michael Bloomberg, and General John Allen. But he began his temper tantrum on Thursday night by whining about Hillary not saying certain magic words that Trump believes will defeat ISIS.Hillary s refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

He has threatened to pull American support from Japan and South Korea, which would leave our two biggest allies in Asia vulnerable.

Pennsylvania is continually being talked up as  swing state  that could go for Trump (they said the same thing about Romney in 2012, and he lost by 5 percent).But as Hillary Clinton delivered her acceptance speech, one that commentators say could sway undecided voters, a new poll comes out showing Clinton beating Trump by a whopping nine points in the  swing state  of Pennsylvania.Here s why that s important: people say Trump could (some say will) win Pennsylvania because of the  rustic belt  white, male centrists who typically lean Democrat, but could be swayed otherwise.The Suffolk University survey showed Clinton leading Trump 50-41, with 8 percent undecided. The poll also closely reflects NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll conducted earlier in July that showed Clinton with a 9 point lead, this one 45-36.What s also interesting is Clinton still blows Trump out of the water when factoring Jill Stein and Gary Johnson in the polling:When Clinton and Trump were matched in the poll against Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton s margin over Trump was the same, at 9 points   46 percent to 37 percent. Johnson earned 5 percent, while Stein took 2 percent and 9 percent were undecided among those candidatesThink about that: before Clinton even delivered her  speech of a lifetime,  two polls   one from a well known publication and one from a close-to-home college, show the same results. Clinton s choice of a progressively centrist VP pick (who is a major ally to unions) could pick up the weary and disenfranchised white blue dog Democrats.After the convention, Clinton and Kaine will be touring the state by bus as they seek to cement and keep their support among Pennsylvanians in the west.Trump continues to be liability for his own campaign while Democrats are getting major viewership at their convention.

Look, we Democrats have always had plenty of differences with the Republican Party, and there s nothing wrong with that,  Obama said before reaching out to those who are #NeverTrump. It s precisely this contest of ideas that pushes our country forward. But what we heard in Cleveland last week wasn t particularly Republican   and it sure wasn t conservative. What we heard was a deeply pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other, and turn away from the rest of the world. There were no serious solutions to pressing problems   just the fanning of resentment, and blame, and anger, and hate. President Obama then stressed unity along with the themes of patriotism and our Founding Fathers. And he even mentioned Ronald Reagan. And that is not the America I know. The America I know is full of courage, and optimism, and ingenuity. The America I know is decent and generous I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together   black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American; young, old; gay, straight; men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big, bold country that we love. Ronald Reagan called America  a shining city on a hill.  Donald Trump calls it  a divided crime scene  that only he can fix.The reason he ll lose it is because he s selling the American people short. We re not a fragile people. We re not a frightful people. Our power doesn t come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order as long as we do things his way. We don t look to be ruled. Our power comes from those immortal declarations first put to paper right here in Philadelphia all those years ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that We the People, can form a more perfect union. And because many Republicans are starting to wake up and realize what their own party has become, they praised President Obama s speech.National Review columnist Rich Lowery was stunned because he seems to think patriotism and the founding documents are trademarked Republican beliefs.American exceptionalism and greatness, shining city on hill, founding documents, etc they re trying to take all our stuff  Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) July 28, 2016Erick Erickson of Redstate couldn t believe how much he enjoyed it.

Anger never built a great republic,  said O Malley.O Malley slammed Trump for his insistence that wages are too high,  a stance the billionaire candidate did an about face on today even though he had argued vehemently against a minimum wage hike during a Republican presidential debate in November. Wages are too high?  O Maller asked incredulously.  Really Donald? I ll tell you what s too high. College tuition is too high. I ll tell you what s too high. The cost of childcare, that s too high. The number of American children who live in poverty, that s too high. Donald Trump s opinion of himself   way, way too high,  O Malley quipped.The former governor then ripped apart Trump s ridiculous assertion that the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese. I ll tell you what: If the Chinese were really capable of designing some kind of diabolical farce to hurt America, they wouldn t invent global warming,  he said.  They d invent Donald Trump. O Malley then said that Trump has been a bully his whole life. But here s what I learned on playgrounds in Catholic school: all bullies are cowards in disguise,  O Malley said.  But unlike that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton actually knows the enduring symbol of America is not a barbed wire fence,  he remarked.  It is the Statue of Liberty.

She also got upset with all the talk about Israel during one of the GOP debates, and she said that Jews are just Christians in need of perfection back in 2007: That is what Christians consider themselves: perfected Jews.

His taxes are under audit, so they can t (even though the head of the IRS completely debunked that claim on live national television).For months Democrats and even Republicans have been hounding the  billionaire  mogul to release his tax returns, a standard that every presidential hopeful has met over the last several decades. But Trump seems to be the only one who will not do it. Even Romney, after enough prodding, did it.There s several theories as to why he won t release them. The first is that they will show he s not actually a billionaire. Another is that it will show he has overvalued his properties (which has already been shown he has) and his businesses. The third option is that it will show he paid virtually nothing in taxes, certainly not his fair share.And the fourth (and now most plausible theory): he has ties to Russian interests/oligarchs. That s the theory of conservative columnist George Will. Given that the FBI has a strong case linking Russia to the DNC email hack, and Trump s campaign manager has close ties to Russia, and that Trump has business dealings with the authoritarian country, that theory seems to stick in people s mind.

Several months ago, it seemed that Obama was brushing off Trump s campaign just like the rest of us, but that has all changed as we near the general election. When asked if Trump could win, Obama didn t sugarcoat it for Americans when he said,  anything is possible Obama s comments didn t come without a few jabs at The Donald, as the President hammered the business mogul for being a pathological liar. Obama said, He is someone that likes attention, he surprised himself that he got this far. As far as the threat of living under a President Trump, Obama said, I ve seen all kinds of crazy stuff happen  but overall stressed that  America is resilient. But just because America might survive 4-8 years of Donald Trump does not mean that we should give him the chance to undo all of our progress and threaten our country s future. Obama stressed the importance of electing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November, and urged all Democratic voters to take this election very seriously. Obama said: So, my advice to Democrats   and I don t have to give this advice to Hillary Clinton, because she already knows it   is you stay worried until all those those votes are cast and counted because you know, one of the dangers in an election like this is that people don t take the challenge seriously.

Like many of you, this election is very personal to me,  Longoria said during her speech.  I m from a small town in South Texas and if you know your history, Texas used to be part of Mexico. Now, I m ninth generation American. My family never crossed a border, the border crossed us. According to PBS:The Longoria family s roots in Texas run back to a time before Texas even existed. Lorenzo Longoria, Eva s first ancestor to arrive in the New World, sailed from Spain in 1603. Through the generations, Lorenzo s descendants moved north to the modern US-Mexico border. In 1767, Pedro Longoria, Eva s 7th great-grandfather, received almost 4000 acres along the Rio Grande in a land grant from the King of Spain. This land stayed in the family for over a century, enduring even the influx of Anglo settlers in the aftermath of the Civil War.In short, Eva Longoria s family has been in America far longer than Donald Trump s. His grandfather Frederick Trump immigrated to this country in 1885. Longoria s family could have retreated south to stay in Mexico if they had wanted to do so. But they chose to stay in America and that is where their allegiance has stayed ever since.Speaking of Trump, Longoria dedicated the next part of her speech to ripping him a new one for insulting just about everyone. When Donald Trump calls us criminals and rapists, he s insulting American families. My father is not a criminal or rapist; in fact, he s a United States veteran. When Trump cruelly mocked a disabled reporter, he was also mocking my special-needs sister Lisa and many like her. When he said that a wife who works is a very dangerous thing, he not only insulted me, he insulted my mother who worked as a special-education teacher for 40 years and raised four children while being a wife.

Researchers with ThreatConnect, who specialize in cyber security, have traced the hacker back to a Russian internet server.According to the Arlington, Va. based ThreatConnect, Guccifer 2.0, the DNC Hacker who has described himself/herself as Romanian, has been linked to a Russian internet server and a digital address that has been associated with various Russian online scams. Guccifer 2.0 is not thought to be a sophisticated hacker. Researchers with ThreatCOnnect believe it is more likely that this is propaganda by a group of people working with the Russian government in an effort to take attention off Moscow as the actual force behind the DNC hack. Now, after further investigation, we can confirm that Guccifer 2.0 is using the Russia-based Elite VPN service to communicate and leak documents directly with the media. We reached this conclusion by analyzing the infrastructure associated with an email exchange with Guccifer 2.0 shared with ThreatConnect by Vocativ s Senior Privacy and Security reporter Kevin Collier. This discovery strengthens our ongoing assessment that Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian propaganda effort and not an independent actor. The experts with ThreatConnect are the first to trace the self-proclaimed hacker back to Russia.Rich Barger, ThreatConnect s chief intelligence officer, reiterated his believe that the party responsible was not a  sophisticated hacker  when speaking with The Daily Beast. These are bureaucrats, not sophisticated hackers,  he insisted. Barger backed up his assessment up with the following:Republican nominee Donald Trump has had an ongoing bromance with Russian president, Vladimir Putin.

Freedom Kids performed at a rally for Donald Trump in Florida last January and played a song containing  lyrics which were terrifying   unless you re pro-war.  After that, the kids were a hit, featured at media appearances, with the three pre-teen girls even telling Inside Edition that Donald told them that he planned to listen to their CD all night long. However, that cozy relationship has changed since then.The father of one of the Freedom Kids, Jeff Popick, who authored  Freedom s Call,   told The Washington Post Monday that he is planning to file a lawsuit against the Trump campaign for violating its agreement with the group. This is not a billion-dollar lawsuit,  Popick told the Post.  I m doing this because I think they have to do the right thing. And if this means having to go through the court system to enforce them doing the right thing, then that s what I have to do. I m not looking to do battle with the Trump campaign, but I have to show my girls that this is the right thing. Popick said that promises were made by various agents of the Trump campaign.It started in Pensacola. When Popick first reached out to the Trump campaign about performing, he spoke with various people including former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. His understanding from the campaign was that the Kids would make two appearances in Florida, where Popick lives. The first event didn t come to fruition, and Popick says he asked for $2,500 in payment for the second performance, in Pensacola. The campaign made a counter-offer: How about a table where the group could presell albums? Popick took the deal.After arriving at the venue, the group found that there was no table, and he said it ended in  complete chaos,   adding,  They clearly had made no provisions for that. Afterward, Popick attempted to contact the Trump campaign to no avail. Popick said money was spent on promotional material for the table, which never existed. In addition, Popick said he lost several promotional opportunities over the confusion with his relationship with the campaign.After Donald opted not to be featured during the Fox News debate due to friction with the network, a Trump campaign representative called Popick to see if the Freedom Kids might perform. Popick   tell me if this sounds familiar   was promised that there would be  huge  exposure for the kids from the event, so an agreement was made.The Freedom Kids and their parents flew out to Iowa only to find a message from the campaign saying there was a change of plan. The performers attended the rally but were told not to talk to the media. They just were constantly coming over, wanting pictures,  Popick said of the news media.  They wanted to take pictures, they wanted to ask questions   and I had to be a real jerk.  In the end, the trip, flights, rental car and hotel were all paid by Popick.After that, he kept reaching out  again and again and again and again,  without luck. He was passed around between staffers; calls went unreturned even after calls were promised. Emails Popick sent to the campaign (which he shared with The Post) detail the interaction between himself and the campaign and his ultimate request.  We are now asking and DEMANDING for what has been promised to us and is now long-overdue (and has been rightly earned by us); that is, a performance at the convention,  an email dated July 9 reads.  Or, be made whole. These are guys that insist they re straight shooters,  Popick said. I ve invested a lot of time, effort, money,  he continued,  and it s just been complete silence. Popick has consulted with an attorney who believes that he has a very strong case.Popick was a fan of the reality show star-turned GOP nominee but he s not so sure anymore. At this point, my position is that I have no position, really,  Popick said.  What he s done to my group or what he s not done for my group doesn t necessarily make him the best candidate, it doesn t make him the worst candidate. I still have to mull that over. He might still be the best candidate as president of the United States   or not. This whole story sounds familiar. It sounds like the Trump  University  scam. We re not sure what Mr. Popick has to mull over. If a person is ripping off your kid, then you wouldn t normally cast a vote for them but we re not going to tell the father of the Freedom Kids how to freedom.Stand in line, Mr. Popick.

It was a dazzling speech   and let s face it   a much-needed one on a day that began fueled by anger surrounding the leak of the Wikileaks emails that seemed to indict some officials in the Democratic National Committee of wanting to conspire to undermine the campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic Primary.Let s be honest   we have different wings of our party. We have traditional, moderate, rank and file Democrats a la the Clintons and the Obamas. We have rank and file Democrats that are a bit further to the left and generally identify as pragmatic progressives, a la Elizabeth Warren (I personally fall into this camp). Then, we have the hard left people who are hardline progressives, many of whom don t even identify as Democrats and aren t registered as such a la Bernie Sanders. However, despite these differences in positions, at the end of the day, we re all left wingers.

Libertarian Party Chairman Nicholas Sarwark did not refrain from bashing the Republican Party and said that the reality clown show is what is causing many Republican lawmakers to abandon ship. After the disaster that we saw in Cleveland, in which a party that was once storied has nominated a reality show star for president, where the convention chairman s cutting off the microphone of a sitting U.S. senator, it s broken,  Sarwark said.

Let us count them alongside Media Matters for America:O Reilly says there s more, but his show is only so long so he probably thinks he can t list them.

However, Representative Hank Johnson (D-GA) spoke on one such issue that needs much closer attention: That of illegal Israeli settlements in Palestine. Johnson has a choice word for the settlers, and it s bang-on target: There has been a steady [stream of Israeli settlers], almost like termites can get into a residence and eat before you know that you ve been eaten up and you fall in on yourself. And they are. For the past several decades, Israel has been eating up Palestinian land and treating Palestinian citizens like subjects and much worse while their leader, Bibi Netanyahu, says Israel must occupy all the land in order to ensure their own safety. There s no regard for the people already living there. Termites stream in and eat the wood of our houses. Israelis stream in and eat the houses of Palestinians.  An apt description if there ever was one.Johnson went on to say: You see one home after another being appropriated by Jewish people who come in to claim that land just because somebody did not spend the night there.The home their [Palestinian] ancestors lived in for generations becomes an Israeli home and a flag goes up. The Palestinians are barred from flying flags in their own neighborhoods. Nobody in the U.S. would tolerate being told they can t fly the American flag. Nobody. But we ll gladly call a country that does this, and so much more with glee, an  ally.  Disgusting.Why is this so important right now? Don t we have more important things to worry about?The answer to those questions is, yes and no. It isn t just important because we re busy supporting an apartheid state, or because of Israel s gross human rights violations. It isn t just because we shouldn t support them if we re going to call ourselves the bastion of freedom we think we are. It s also because our support of Israel has poisoned many of our leaders to the point where they actually want to criminalize freedom of expression.The BDS movement, which stands for Boycott, Divest and Sanction, is under attack here because of our blind love for Israel. Staunch supporters of Israel have been quietly criminalizing that movement, despite the fact that this very same thing helped bring about an end to apartheid in South Africa.Boycotts are also a staple of American protest. Yet the pro-Israel crowd would destroy freedom of expression in dogged support of an ally that maybe shouldn t be an ally. Staunch defenders of the Constitution would tear up the First Amendment before denouncing Israel. It s sick.Israel uses us. Sure, some may say that we need them for intelligence on more hostile Middle Eastern nations (when a lot of our support is because of Sheldon Adelson, his money, and AIPAC), so we send billions of dollars worth of weapons and equipment to them, for which we the taxpayers are on the hook, and pretend not to see their relentless and violent crawl across Palestine.We wouldn t turn a blind eye to termites  relentless crawl through the structures of our houses, though.Ben Cohen, of The Daily Banter, put it just as perfectly as Rep. Johnson when he said: Israelis routinely claim that they have to defend themselves against Palestinian attacks. But occupying someone else s land is an attack itself, so it is impossible to defend yourself if you are the person attacking. So can we please stop pretending Israel is being attacked? As of March, half of Israeli Jews actually supported ethnic cleansing. We have white supremacists here that support the same thing. We fought a war in Bosnia over ethnic cleansing. It s only something we must stop when we hear calls for ethnic cleansing coming from people and places we don t like. Israel? They ve brainwashed us into thinking they re always the victim.Our growing problem with Islamophobia isn t helping, either.Going into the final stretch of this election cycle, Israel isn t just a distant foreign policy issue   something to be dealt with, maybe, after the new president and Congress take office in January. Israel s atrocious and disgusting policies toward Palestine impact us in a direct way, because our support of them could cost us our own freedom.

Unfortunately, there s a lot of discontent among the right toward the changing face of the United States and on the left, there s discontent over the fact that the United States isn t changing fast enough, and that discontentment could easily land Donald Trump in the White House, according to FiveThirtyEight s statistical guru, Nate Silver.While the polls are in a virtual tie, a breakdown of electoral college votes paints a much bleaker picture. According to Silver, Trump is ahead of Clinton by a whopping 15 points.Silver s  now-cast,  updated with fresh surveys on Monday, shows Trump s current likelihood of winning at 57.5 percent, compared with Clinton s 42.5 percent. In the 11 battleground states, Colorado, Virginia and Michigan would go to Clinton, while Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Iowa would go to Trump.The breakdown shifts a bit between the Electoral College and the popular vote. Silver s model currently predicts the popular vote going 45.4 percent to Trump vs. 45.1 percent to Clinton, but the Electoral College giving Trump a wider margin of victory, 285 votes and Clinton 252.6.Source: PoliticoThis warning alone should be enough to wake up some who are on the fence and some Bernie Sanders supporters, but not all is lost. Silver notes that polling during conventions is notoriously inaccurate.On the one hand, the conventions are not a particularly good time to sweat every tick in the polls. Instead, they tend to be one of the less accurate times for polling. Historically, it s unusual for candidates not to at least pull into a rough tie after their party convention   John McCain and Sarah Palin did so in 2008, for example, and even Walter Mondale led a couple of polls in 1984. But those bounces do not always turn out to be predictive.Silver has another hand, though, and he s saying that Clinton has had a very bad July. She could get a convention bump this week, but with Wikileaks  email dump and Sanders supporters protesting every single speaker, it s doubtful. In other words, be afraid, but vote and drive people to the polls if necessary.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic at Getty Images. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This responsible gun owner  was negligent, and that negligence not only took the life of his child, but has also now put him behind bars for at least a quarter of a century. He apologized in court and said that he loves his children dearly.The boy and his 11-year-old sister were visiting their father at his home on Nov. 9. The father s loaded gun was reportedly hidden in his bedroom closet, but due to the curious nature of young children, the deadly weapon didn t stay hidden for very long.The young girl testified in court that she and her brother were playing an imaginary game and they were acting out a video game when the tragedy occurred. She had been holding the shotgun when suddenly, it accidentally fired, killing her younger brother. She was given immunity for her testimony.The names of the father, sister, and other family members are being withheld so as not to identify the victim in this tragic case.Accidental shootings of young children are the most heartbreaking victims of gun violence. According to The Gun Violence Archive, 350 children under the age of 12 have been killed or injured by guns so far this year. The number of older children that have been victims of gun violence in 2016 is even higher, with 1,699 teens age 12-17 being shot.

Now, he is using both his fame and fortune to fight against the killings of unarmed black men by law enforcement as well as violent attacks against police officers.Jordan made his powerful statements in an essay posted at The Undefeated. He began by condemning the violence against both American-Americans and law enforcement. As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers,  he began.The famed athlete continued, saying that he is  saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late.  I know this country is better than that, and I can no longer stay silent,  he said.  We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers   who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all   are respected and supported. Jordan explained that because of his experiences with the police officers who have protected his family over the years he has  seen up close the dedication of the law enforcement officers  and has the  greatest respect for their sacrifice and service.  But he then went on to say that as he knows that many African-Americans   experiences with law enforcement have been different than mine. I have decided to speak out in the hope that we can come together as Americans, and through peaceful dialogue and education, achieve constructive change,  wrote Jordan.In an effort to help find a way to put an end to the violence, Jordan announced that he is putting his money where his mouth is and donating $1 million each to the International Association of Chiefs of Police s newly established Institute for Community-Police Relations and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The Institute for Community-Police Relations  policy and oversight work is focused on building trust and promoting best practices in community policing,  Jordan explained.  My donation to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the nation s oldest civil rights law organization, will support its ongoing work in support of reforms that will build trust and respect between communities and law enforcement. Jordan said that he knows these contributions will not solve the problems plaguing our country, but he is hoping that his donations  will help both organizations make a positive difference. We are privileged to live in the world s greatest country   a country that has provided my family and me the greatest of opportunities,  Jordan concluded.  The problems we face didn t happen overnight and they won t be solved tomorrow, but if we all work together, we can foster greater understanding, positive change and create a more peaceful world for ourselves, our children, our families and our communities.

The Democratic Party will have New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and they will have Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren in a spot that could very well set her up as Hillary Clinton s successor.Elizabeth Warren has successfully gotten under the thin skin of Donald Trump for months. Every time he attacks her on Twitter she responds by destroying him.In recognition of her efforts and her status as a defender of the poor and middle class in America against corporate exploitation, Warren has been chosen to deliver the keynote address at the DNC this week.Warren will be only the third woman to deliver the keynote speech. The first being Rep. Barbara Jordan in 1976, followed by beloved former Texas Governor and women s rights crusader Ann Richards in 1988. And while neither of those two women would go on to run for president, Elizabeth Warren stands on the cusp of history in the making. Hillary Clinton looks to become the first female president in American history. If she wins and serves with distinction, it could pave the way for Warren s rise as her successor in 2024 should she be willing to take on the mantle.As you may recall, a man named Barack Obama delivered the keynote address at the DNC Convention in 2004. Four years later he became the first African-American president in the United States.While the keynote address does not guarantee anyone of future presidential aspirations, it does mean a great deal to those who care about what the message of the party is. Warren is decidedly on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, so she will more than likely focus on progressive issues such as raising the minimum wage, better healthcare, climate change, and working with our allies abroad while promoting tolerance and diversity. Clinton may not have chosen Warren as her running mate, but giving the keynote is a high honor and it gives Warren the opportunity to put progressive policies in the spotlight. This is especially important as Hillary continues to woo supporters of Bernie Sanders to her campaign.This keynote selection screams that Hillary Clinton is inching more to the left as progressives have been hoping and it gives progressives a bigger place at the table than they have had in many years. Combined with the platform changes Bernie Sanders was able to insert, this could signal a progressive agenda is on the way if Sanders  supporters are patient enough to let it happen gradually instead of all at once.The shift to the left could also mean that a more progressive candidate than Hillary Clinton could very well succeed her. That means progressivism has a bright future if they make sure a Democrat is elected to succeed President Obama in November. Because Donald Trump sure won t advance progressive policies.Featured image via Chris Somodevilla/Getty Images ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,  Trump s son, Donald Jr., told a real estate conference in 2008, according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews, a trade publication.  We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. Indeed, Trump has been desperate to build a Trump Tower in Moscow for over 30 years now and if he is able to become president and do some favors for Russia and Putin he would get closer to achieving his business goal.In fact, even some of Trump s top advisers have close ties to Russia.Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort  has done multimillion-dollar business deals with pro-Russian oligarchs  and worked for recently ousted Putin-backed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych s downfall sparked the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine in which they seized the Crimean Peninsula.Two of Trump s advisers, Carter Page and Michael Caputo, worked with Gazprom, which is the government-controlled natural gas corporation. As Talking Points Memo described it,  imagine if most or all of the US energy industry were rolled up into a single company and it were personally controlled by the US President who used it as a source of revenue and patronage. And there s Trump s foreign policy adviser former General Michael Flynn. He cozied up to Putin at a dinner in Moscow in 2015.With all of that being said, Trump s foreign policy ideas would strongly favor Russia at a time when Putin has never been more dangerous, especially to Europe.Not only has Trump been talking about fundamentally weakening NATO by pulling US support, which would give Russia an opportunity to flex its military muscles to take over some Eastern European countries, Page suggested earlier this year that Trump could lift economic sanctions placed on Russia since 2014, which would help some of his Russian business buddies. And in what has clearly been under-reported on by the media, Trump and his team successfully strong-armed the GOP into ditching the party platform condemning Russia s aggression toward Ukraine the GOP s support of assisting Ukraine against Putin.And Trump has been rewarded handsomely for this treachery as Putin has directed Russian state media to blare out support for Trump s campaign. Russian hackers also hacked into the DNC to give Trump information to use against the Democrats.In short, Trump would be nothing more than a puppet of Vladamir Putin should he be placed in the White House. It would the first time in American history that the leader of the free world is controlled, especially by a Russian ruler who disregards human rights and subverts democracy. Ronald Reagan would be spinning in his grave. What was the point of the Cold War if the United States is just going to become a Russian satellite state anyway?If Republicans think that President Obama is similar to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, they haven t seen nothing yet.

The leaked documents were simply the straw that broke the camel s back, though. Wasserman Schulz has been a divisive figure within the party leadership for sometime now, and after this Democratic leaders decided that she had to go. Wasserman Schultz says of the decision: Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals [which include electing Clinton president] is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention. As Party Chair, this week I will open and close the Convention and I will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats, but for all Americans. Wasserman Schultz will now speak on Monday afternoon, though originally she had been removed from all speaking slots at the Democrats  big event. However, it seems that her supporters, and even the outgoing DNC chair herself fought for her right to be able to speak. Senator Sanders had this to say on the subject:What does this mean for the Democratic Party? It means more party unity, that s what. We cannot win in November   or any other election   if the party splits. In the beginning, everyone underestimated the power of Sen. Sanders  message, and it seems that rank and file, establishment Democrats and party leaders saw him and his supporters as a distraction and an annoyance rather than someone whose ideas and policy proposals should be taken seriously. This was a mistake. We can never assume that everyone is as loyal to any political party as said party s leadership would like them to be.Now, as a firm Clinton supporter, I have had my issues with Bernie Sanders and his supporters. However, party unity and beating Donald Trump is the top priority, not petty infighting. Sanders had great influence over this year s party platform- the most progressive in the party s history   and he and his supporters should be proud of what they have accomplished.Now that DWS is out of our way, let s go forth and kick butt and elect Democrats from the top of the ballot down in November.Feataured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This is especially true of Trump s plan to ban Muslims from traveling across the U.S. border, and his ideas regarding building a wall along the southern border and forcing Mexico to pay for it, and the mass deportation plans. Despite the lack of surprise, though, this is an important endorsement. Bloomberg is a billionaire, just like Trump, and he is a high profile GOP politician.

Overall, very little was said about what they will do, and it made Hillary kind of sad.Speaking on 60 Minutes, she flat-out said [emphasis mine]: I don t know what their convention was about, other than criticizing me. I seem to be the only unifying theme that they had. There was no positive agenda. It was a very dark, divisive campaign.

Republicans still can t decide how to unify behind someone as vile as Trump, and the RNC wasn t well-attended in part because of that. The fact that they can only unify in their hatred of Hillary is, indeed, sad.The only other unifying theme they have is the impending collapse of the U.S., which is something of which the GOP has been trying to convince us since Nixon ran for president.

The first-grader accidentally shot himself while handling a loaded gun at the home of his grandfather in Jones County, Georgia. According to The Telegraph, two adults were in the home when the seven-year-old came across the unsecured gun. Neither of the adults was in the room with the child. They heard the sound of a shot and then came in and found the child injured and immediately called 911,  Jones County Sheriff s Officer Kenny Gleaton said.  Unfortunately, the victim had passed away at the scene.  Gleaton went on to say: I would urge people, if they are going to choose to have firearms in their homes, I just encourage them to be responsible and store them safely and separately from ammunition. Keep them under lock and key at all times when not in use. While we hear a lot about  responsible gun owners,  from the NRA, it seems nearly every day in the U.S. we read about a child killed in an accidental shooting. These needless deaths happen because a parent or relative failed to keep a deadly weapon out of the hands of someone too young to understand what can happen.According to the Gun Violence Archive, an organization which tracks shootings across the United States, more than 2,000 children have been injured or killed by guns so far in 2016. Many of these deaths were  accidental shootings,  like those that killed two children this week. No matter what the NRA says, there s nothing responsible about a nation that allows its children to die needlessly, year after year, because some  adult  believes owning a gun is their God-given right.

Political analyst Jeff Greenfield wasn t ready to say that Trump would not be a political success if it were not Ailes.  Roger Ailes did to the media what Donald Trump did to the political process.  What Greenfield is saying is that both Ailes and Trump are spectacular at rallying hardcore right-wing conservatives to support whatever narrative they choose to promote.While Greenfield isn t ready to put the burden of Trump on Ailes shoulders, Jane Hall, a former regular guest on Fox News said that  you would not have Donald Trump without Roger Ailes. It has been rumored that Ailes next major project besides the autobiography he is going to write   would be to work on Trump s presidential campaign. Panelist and Trump supporter, Jeff Lord, didn t provide any more credibility to those rumors. That being said, he did mention that Ailes would be very useful on the Trump campaign trail.Fox News, right-wing extremism, and now Trump exist in a reinforcing feedback loop that has caused so much harm to the United States and the world.

Duke says that he was inspired to run for office because of Trump s campaign.Trump has previously denounced Duke s views and his endorsement of his campaign. Trump says in the interview that he does not support Duke s senatorial run. However, after a bit of grilling from Todd, Trump implies that he might vote for Duke under certain circumstances. Todd said: David Duke announced his Senate candidacy claiming your agenda for his own, or essentially saying glad that you spoke out. Newt Gingrich said, every Republican should repudiate this guy no matter what he says. Trump responds by saying  I did and I do. That s when Todd asks Trump: Would you support a Democrat over David Duke, if that was what was necessary to defeat him? Trump then says that it would depend on the Democrat who is running for office. Though he does say that he wouldn t support Duke. I guess, depending on who the Democrat was, but the answer would be yes. Look, the answer is, as quick as you can say it, rebuked. Is that OK? Rebuked. It shouldn t matter who is running against Duke, as long as they are better than Duke himself. It s nearly impossible to imagine a candidate that could be worse than Duke running on a Democratic ticket. Even if someone is a firm believer in not supporting the lesser of two evils relative to their political position, you do everything you can to support that candidate if their opponent happens to be a former leader of one of the worst hate groups in the United States.You can watch the interview below.Featured image via video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Within minutes of arriving at the scene, Burns shot and killed 22-year-old Deravis Caine Rogers, an unarmed black man who was driving his own vehicle on the premises of the apartment complex.According to Burns, he saw Rogers get into his vehicle and  became suspicious  of him. Although he had no reason to suspect that the man had committed a crime, Burns states he attempted to block Rogers  car from leaving the parking lot. Rogers drove around the police car. That s when Burns shot him in the head.During an internal police investigation, officer Burns stated that he shot the unarmed man out of  fear for his life.  He told investigators that Rogers drove his vehicle directly toward him. Video evidence and witness testimony contradict the officer s story.Burns is one of the first Georgia police officers to be arrested and charged for an an-duty shooting without a grand jury verdict. Prosecutors believe that there is enough evidence to convict the officer on felony murder charges. Burns also faces additional charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and violation of his oath of office.Prosecutors say that Burns had no reason to consider Rogers a criminal suspect. Authorities found no evidence that any vehicles in the apartment complex parking lot had been broken into or tampered with. They also found that Burns lied about the events that led up to the shooting.Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard issued a public statement, following the officer s arrest, saying: By reason of the evidence presented by several eye-witnesses, videos, and the findings of the Atlanta Police Department, we will proceed in this case in the same manner as any other defendant similarly charged   arrest, indictment and resolution. Howard s decision to prosecute Burns without a grand jury indictment comes on the heels of a new GA law, which curbs police officers  right to a grand jury trial.

I actually don t think it s a rollback. In fact, you could say it s an expansion. I m looking now at territory,  Trump told Todd.  People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. Oh, you can t use the word Muslim. Remember this. And I m okay with that, because I m talking territory instead of Muslim. We re going to have tough standards,  Trump went on to say.  And if a person can t prove   that they re from an area, and if a person can t prove what they have to be able to prove, they re not coming into this country. And I would stop the Syrian migration and a Syrian from coming into this country in two seconds. Let s be clear, Trump s proposal is a rollback. His initial call for a unilateral ban on Muslims entering the United States is both incredibly bigoted and unconstitutional. It also happens to be impossible to enforce and would severely damage the United States  reputation. Even if Trump were to become president, it is hard to see how such a proposal would actually be implemented.That s why this rollbacked version of his proposal is actually far worse. That s because it can actually be implemented. While still divisive among the GOP, Trump would have far more support for his modified approval. More than half of the governors in the United States want to ban Syrians from entering the United States as of last year. There are even a few Democrats who would jump on board the xenophobia train.So, yes  this is a rollback.

They shouldn t be. His reasons for voting for the braggadocios billionaire are even worse than the reasons for most Americans.Malik Obama lives in Kenya, but he is eligible to vote in the United States because he sometimes lives in Maryland and he worked there. Rupert Murdoch s New York Post claims that Malik is registered to vote in the United States.Malik is the oldest of the Obama brothers; he s related through their father, but the two men have different mothers. The older Obama, 58, has spent most of his life as a Democrat, but likes Trump s slogan of  Mak(ing) America Great Again.  He doesn t like Hillary Clinton s email scandal, and he has more than one personal bone to pick with his younger brother.About Trump: I like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart,  Malik Obama told The Post from his home in the rural village of Kogelo.  Make America Great Again is a great slogan. I would like to meet him. About Hillary Clinton and the email situation: She should have known better as the custodian of classified information,  said Obama.The third reason makes one question whether Malik had been a Democrat at all. The man who reportedly has as many as 12 wives hates the idea of marriage equality. I feel like a Republican now because they don t stand for same-sex marriage, and that appeals to me,  he said.Then, it gets a bit more personal. The elder Obama says that he was close, personal friends with ousted and assassinated dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. I still feel that getting rid of Khadafy didn t make things any better in Libya,  he said.  My brother and the secretary of state disappointed me in that regard. Malik has an even more personal beef with his brother. It s about money. Malik is in charge of the Barack H. Obama Foundation, which named after the Obamas  father. The foundation was set up to help people in their native village in Kenya, but it hadn t registered with the state of Virginia, from which it was run. Shortly after the story became public, the IRS approved the foundation s tax exempt status. Fingers pointed at President Obama, but Malik insists his brother didn t help at all, and for that, he seems to resent him. My brother didn t help me at all,  said Obama.  He wanted me to shut it down when I set it up. He hasn t supported me at all. Oh, and the President also refused to intervene in his older brother s foray into politics, when he ran for governor of his Kenyan county. Malik partly blames his brother for his loss.Here s the video:Trump, in the meantime, is loving it. Wow, President Obama s brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016None of this should be terribly surprising. Despite the fact that the two men were best men at each others  weddings, Malik got on the birther train. He even questioned whether the President actually shared a father with him. Of course, we can also go birther, asking if Malik is actually registered to vote.Featured image via New York Post screenshot.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Jones responded by teaching him a lesson on character and proceeded to explain that he thinks Trump is a racial opportunist who is using racial tensions to get power.Then Shroyer tried to portray Hillary Clinton as a racial opportunist by claiming that she responded to the shooting of police officers in Dallas by saying white people need to feel guilt when it comes to the grievances of African-Americans.Van Jones expressed that he didn t think Clinton did that, and he was right. Nowhere in her Twitter response did Hillary use the word  guilt.  She merely asked white Americans to  listen. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers you face every day,  she wrote.White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers you face every day.

Shroyer said he is. And that s when Jones pounced.Because while Shroyer praised the Justice Department decision on Wilson he ignored the fact that the Justice Department also reported that there was systemic racism within the Ferguson Police Department. The only thing you see in Ferguson, and this is where my heart breaks, the only thing you see in Ferguson is that there was a protest about a case that later turned out to be a false situation. And yet the same department also   who you already said was credible   came out and said that there was massive, widespread abuse of the black population, which is part of why they believed what was going on. And yet with that, I don t see the same level of concern. It is much worse to me to hear that a whole police department has been giving extra tickets to a community   that s terrible   than if somebody was wrong about some protest.

I believe in law and order, I just want the police to obey the law too. I don t want anyone going to a funeral, black or blue.

However, Kaine compliments Hillary in a way that many people probably haven t thought of, and their pairing makes Trump and Pence look far worse now than before.Politifact, which Republicans revile because they think facts are pesky, annoying things to be ignored, put out a scorecard with the ratings of 27 statements Tim Kaine has made. It turns out that he has more statements rated True and Mostly True than he does Half True, Mostly False, and False put together. He has no Pants On Fire ratings at all.Compare that to Mike Pence. Politifact has rated 20 statements Pence has made, and of those 20, only four are True or Mostly True. Four! He has six Half True statements and six False statements. His only saving grace here is that he also doesn t have any Pants On Fire ratings.A look at Hillary Clinton s and Donald Trump s Politifact scorecards just drives home the point that the GOP is riddled with people who lie and spread misinformation. Trump, being the master liar he is, has more False and Pants On Fire statements than he does Mostly False, Half True, Mostly True and True statements combined.Hillary, on the other hand, has more True and Mostly True statements than she does Half True, Mostly False, False and Pants On Fire all together, just like her chosen running mate. These two are a good team just on that basis.So is it really any wonder that Hillary introduced her running mate as  everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not?  Of course, she was talking about the policies that Trump and Pence are putting together, but the ability to acknowledge facts and tell the truth is another major way in which Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are not, well, anything like any Republican we ve got.In other words, we have two presidential tickets that illustrate Republican honesty versus Democratic honesty, and Democratic honesty wins hands down.

For those not familiar how the game works, locations of interest   called Pokestops   such as public works of art, historical locations, and other community hot spots.The person who suggested the location be added as a location in the game developer s database took the opportunity to make a statement.

The Cudell Gazebo bears no marker indicating that is a memorial for Rice. The gazebo was scheduled to be demolished though it has not due to certain groups who wish to see the area preserved as a historical landmark. As of right now, the gazebo has remained in a state of limbo. So, besides the stuffed animals and other tokens left by community members, there is no way to tell what the historical importance of what the location is.This virtual marker runs contrary to the findings of a grand jury who decided not to bring charges against the officers involved in the shooting.A commentator on the Belt claims to be the person who wrote the description for the Gazebo. He claims that he wrote the description not thinking that it would be noticed by many people, as it was added to a much less popular game created by the same company who created Pokemon Go. He writes that he wrote the description because: Memorials are built in the hope people will remember. The events that ended Tamir Rice s life are something that I worry will be forgotten. It was difficult to see the gazebo pictured without context, and I added a bit without expecting it to be noticed by anyone else. The gazebo in the park should be turned into an official memorial for Rice. However, even if it was the spot would not tell the story that so many people hear.

The suit seeks unspecified damages.While no one from the Waller County Jail was indicted on murder charges, Brian Encinia was indicted on perjury charges. The charges stem from his testimony, under oath, regarding his actions on the day Bland was arrested.Video of the encounter between Encinia and Bland, a Black Lives Matter activist, contradicts the trooper s statements under oath. Encinia testified that he ordered Bland to exit her vehicle in order to conduct a traffic investigation. The jury, which had access to the dashcam video, found Encinia s statement to be untrue.Sandra Bland supposedly hung herself with a plastic trash bag, three days after Encinia took her into custody. The 28-year-old civil rights leader was in the process of moving from the Chicago area to Texas, where she was scheduled to begin work at Prairie View A&M University. Those who were closest to her say that her spirits were good and she was excited at the prospect of her new job and life in Texas.Watch the video below, courtesy of Democracy Now.Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Kaine, who speaks fluent Spanish, used his language skills during a rally with Clinton on Saturday.And Donald Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes had a problem with it. I appreciate him having multi-cultural and speaking Spanish, I think that s a great idea,  she claimed before demonstrating Trump s nativism.  And we can all bring out our languages. Melania can come out and speak her five different languages as well, but what Mr. Trump did, he spoke in a language that all Americans can understand. That is English! Of course, she couldn t resist insulting Hispanics and the Spanish language either. And that is one good thing that was great I thought. I didn t have to get a translator for anything that was going on at the RNC this week. And I m hoping I m not gonna have to start brushing up back on my  Dora the Explorer  to understand some of the speeches given this week. Here s the video via YouTube.Trump and Republicans already face serious backlash from Hispanic voters in November since the Republican nominee has been insulting them since the first day of his campaign. According to Gallup, Trump is viewed unfavorably by 77 percent of Hispanics.As Gallup noted:The major factor most likely contributing to Trump s image deficit among Hispanics is one of the first highly publicized controversies of his presidential campaign in June, when he called for building a giant wall along the Mexican border. He also characterized Mexicans coming into the U.S. as drug traffickers and rapists. Since then, Trump s strong and controversial stances against other immigrant groups may have reinforced the ill will among Hispanics, the majority of whom immigrated to this country within the last several generations.Just like the women vote, Trump could end up losing a larger percentage of the Hispanic vote tha MItt Romney did in 2012 and Hillary Clinton could win both groups by larger margins than President Obama did.And conservative hatred of Dora the Explorer is well documented.According to Alternet:Dora the Explorer is an adorable 8-year-old brown girl who travels the world on missions and teaches kids Spanish in each episode. The cartoon is almost universally loved, and when it emerged it felt revolutionary young girls of color could see themselves being strong and adventurious just as they were forming their perceptions of self. But when the state of Arizona began its racist crusade against Latinos under the guise of curbing immigration, some extreme right-wingers saw Dora as a good high-profile way to perpetuate their racism without actually targeting anyone real. In 2010, a fake mug shot of Dora looking beat up and holding the sign  Illegal Border Crossing Resisting Arrest  appeared on right-wing sites. Keep in mind, Dora is supposed to be eight! If there s any question about the vitriol the right harbors toward undocumented immigrants, look no further.In short, this is why Hispanics hate Republicans right now. Clearly, that Hispanic outreach the GOP promised after their crushing defeat in 2012 never happened.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Indeed, it s no secret that the KKK s former Grand Wizard, David Duke, loves Donald Trump. However, there are other white supremacists here who are far less obvious, and therefore, more insidious, than anything groups like the KKK could do. They appeared at the Republican National Convention in droves to cheer on their hero, Donald Trump.This group is well-heeled, well-dressed, clean-cut, and they want to remove everyone who isn t white and Christian from this country. Literally. They think Trump will help them further their  rational  arguments in support of an actual ethnic cleansing of the U.S. Following Trump s disaster of a speech at the Republican National Convention, Richard Spencer, a very prominent white supremacist, said: We ll help [blacks, Jews, Hispanics, etc.] go somewhere else. I m not a maniac.I know in order to achieve what I want to achieve, you have to deal with people rationally. Because expelling most of the U.S.  population is a completely rational position to have.He is a maniac   he just can t see it.After Trump s Thursday speech, Spencer and others spoke to a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition as well as an executive from another major Jewish group, and these two were shocked at how cavalier he and his group were in totally dismissing their concerns out of hand, like they re second-class citizens.To these people, though, they are second-class citizens. And these are the kinds of people Donald Trump draws to him, and only rejects them when the press pushes him on it. His campaign slogan is a magnet for white supremacists. In fact, Spencer actually said: Trust me. Trump thinks like me. Do you think it s a coincidence that everybody like me loves Trump and supports him? He s not wrong. His Royal Whiteness has called for deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants, barring Muslims from entering the country, and says he s the  law and order candidate  who will stop the  terrorists  that are Black Lives Matter. It s actually not a surprise that white supremacists love him.But don t call them  white supremacists!  They like  Europeanists,   alt-right,  and  white nationalists.  In other words, they use terms that couch their white supremacy in something that they think sounds less bigoted, so they can turn more people into bigots.Spencer is actually on the Southern Poverty Law Center s radar because he pushes Aryan Nation ideals so hard. He believes that the ethnic cleansing required to return  dispossessed  white people to their rightful place on high should be peaceful, but should definitely happen post haste. He s called Martin Luther King, Jr. a fraud and degenerate, and he s said that immigration is a proxy war against white people whose grandchildren would find themselves in a country  alien and hostile  if action isn t taken.The sickest part of this is that Spencer not only thinks he and his positions are rational, but that Trump will  cleanse  this country in a calm and rational manner, because if ethnic cleansing is just done right, it won t in unrest or violence and will put white people back into their ivory towers. These people are one of the primary reasons Trump is so dangerous.Featured image via William Thomas Cain/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

You don't give a dam what damage this caused me  Jill Harth (@jillharth) June 24, 2016Harth said she first met Trump in 1992 when she and George Houraney, her business partner and boyfriend at the time, were trying to recruit the billionaire as a partner in their beauty pageant. She claims the unwanted advances began at their very first meeting. Donald Trump stared at me throughout that meeting.

Throughout the evening, Trump repeatedly groped her under the table, violating her  physical and mental integrity  by attempting to touch [her] private parts. Harth said that Trump continued to call her and tried repeatedly to convince her to come to his home for private late-night business meetings. Finally, he insisted that she and Houraney on having a meeting at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. During the meeting, Trump took the group on a tour. Then, Harth said he  forcibly  pulled her away from the group and cornered her in one of his children s rooms. He tried to make his move. He pushed me up against the wall and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again. And I had to physically say,  What are you doing? Stop it.  It was a shocking thing to have him do this, because he knew that I was with George. He knew they were in the next room. And how could he be doing this when I m there for business? If it s not consensual and somebody pushes you up against a wall and is all over you? If I hadn t pushed him away, I m sure he would ve just went for it. He was aggressive. And he has a sense of entitlement. And he thinks everybody s in love with him   every woman. I ve heard him say things like this. Harth dropped her suit after Trump settled an outstanding business lawsuit with Houraney, in which they claimed the real estate tycoon broke their contract when he backed out of the American Dream festival.Harth said that the fact that everyone was rushing to defend Trump, the man who attacked her, was a large part of what convinced her that it was time to speak out. Nobody was defending me, that s why I m talking,  Harth said.  You can believe it or not, but I went through hell and I still have to relive this again.

The decision was announced on Friday night on Clinton s Twitter and Facebook accounts.Introducing Kaine, Clinton wrote:Tim is a lifelong fighter for progressive causes and one of the most qualified vice presidential candidates in our nation s history. But his credentials alone aren t why I asked him to run alongside me.Tim s a man of relentless optimism who believes no problem is unsolvable if you re willing to put in the work. That commitment to delivering results has stayed with him throughout his decades-long career as a public servant.She concluded,  So join me and Tim, and let s get to work and go win this thing. Kaine was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012, the year President Obama was elected to the White House.In 2005, he defeated conservative Republican Jerry Kilgore in Virginia s gubernatorial election, and served as governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2010. After that he served as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2009 to 2011.Kaine received widespread kudos in Virginia for his response to the horrific Virginia Tech gun massacre where 32 people were killed:Kaine was universally praised for a sensitive and commanding response to the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech. He returned from a trade mission to Japan and quickly gathered highly regarded experts to lead an inquiry. After the panel reached its conclusions, Kaine was able to get sweeping mental-health reforms passed in the General Assembly.That made him even more of an annoyance to the NRA, and while they have spent heavily to hurt him (and they gave him an  F  for his record on guns), he beat them and won. A few months ago he backed up Clinton for speaking out about guns and the NRA.Other Democrats argue that Clinton has nothing to lose. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) said the NRA has become a  paper tiger,  noting the elections he s won despite the NRA s vocal opposition. Kaine said: I think she has no illusion that even if she didn t say a word about guns, the NRA would be out there blasting her to say she had a conspiratorial plan to work with the U.N. to take everybody s guns away, so why not go head-on on an issue that will improve safety. Well, if the NRA hates him, that s definitely a great check mark for Senator Kaine. Congratulations on your selection, Senator.

The post read: A message to all my Afro America friends and family. When you are encountered by a white officer make sure that you are in a public place, and comply to all of their commands, because they are looking for a reason to kill a black man. And always keep your hands in the air, and never resist. I m so tired of cops using these famous words  I was in fear of my life.  I m praying for Louisiana, that could have been my nephew in B.R. FacebookThis post was written after the high profile police brutality incidents in Louisiana and Minnesota, so it is perfectly understandable why those tragedies would be weighing on Vincent s heart and he would want to warn his loved ones of the dangers they might encounter. Vincent also had other posts on his Facebook account that addressed police brutality. One of them, posted on July 12, was an illustration on 10 rules of survival if stopped by the police.  Vincent commented over the illustration: I can t promise you that this is 100% true, but it s about 85% to 95% and you just might make it home safely. Unfortunately, Vincent s post has landed him in hot water. According to Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac, Vincent s post is being reviewed to see if it falls within the department s  social media procedure and our rules and regulations.  In a statement, Isaac said: The Cincinnati Police Department strives to maintain a culture of professionalism, as well as transparency and accountability for our actions. I am proud of the work of the men and women of the Cincinnati Police Department and our efforts to work collaboratively with the community. We are aware of a recent post to a commonly used social media site by one of our officers that refers to an interpretation of a law enforcement officer s actions. The comments that were posted are under review as they relate to our Social Media procedure and our Rules and Regulations. A panel discussion was later held at New Prospect Baptist Church in Roselawn, where an audience asked Isaac if there was racism in the Cincinnati Police Department. Isaac responded: I don t think anyone can say there is not racism inside the department. Vincent s post may be even more prominent now, as we are seeing situations where black men are doing everything that police tell them to, and still being shot. Just earlier this week, unarmed black man Charles Kinsey was shot with his hands in the air while trying to take care of a patient with autism. Fortunately, Kinsey lived but many are not so lucky. Referencing Kinsey s incident, Bishop Bobby Hilton of Word of Deliverance Ministries and president of the local chapter of civil rights group National Action Network commented on this horrific incident: When there is a hint of this, that we have police officers who have this thought process about black men, these officers have to be dismissed. We are now seeing situations in Minnesota and Florida, where black men are doing what they are told by police   putting their hands up, complying with all instructions   and they are still shot. It s understandable why Vincent s posts have caused a stir, but to pretend that there wasn t some truth to what he was saying is ignorant. African Americans have been targeted and mistreated by police for far too long, and it is a situation that must be addressed.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He is so hardcore that he s even a friend of former Texas Governor Rick Perry and thought the world of Ronald Reagan.But now that the party has chosen Donald Trump as their 2016 nominee, Ladd wants nothing more to do with the GOP any longer, and he tore Republicans a new one in a letter he wrote announcing his resignation from the York Township Republican Committeemen s Organization and it is an epic read. At the national level, the delusions necessary to sustain our Cold War coalition were becoming dangerous long before Donald Trump arrived,  Ladd pointed out.  From tax policy to climate change, we have found ourselves less at odds with philosophical rivals than with the fundamentals of math, science and objective reality. And then Donald Trump came along and made the party even worse. From his fairy-tale wall to his schoolyard bullying and his flirtation with violent racists, Donald Trump offers America a singular narrative   a tale of cowards. Fearful people, convinced of our inadequacy, trembling before a world alight with imaginary threats, crave a demagogue. Neither party has ever elevated to this level a more toxic figure, one that calls forth the darkest elements of our national character.With three decades invested in the Republican Party, there is a powerful temptation to shrug and soldier on. Despite the bold rhetoric, we all know Trump will lose. Why throw away a great personal investment over one bad nominee? Trump is not merely a poor candidate, but an indictment of our character. Preserving a party is not a morally defensible goal if that party has lost its legitimacy. Ladd goes on to reminisce about Reagan s positive message and then sharply rebukes Republicans for abandoning their morality to pledge their allegiance to a fascist who has none. Fast-forward to our present leadership and the nature of our dilemma is clear. I watched Paul Ryan speak at Donald Trump s convention the way a young child watches his father march off to prison. Thousands of Republican figures that loathe Donald Trump, understand the danger he represents, and privately hope he loses, are publicly declaring their support for him. In Illinois our local and state GOP organizations, faced with a choice, have decided on complicity.Our leaders  compromise preserves their personal capital at our collective cost. Their refusal to dissent robs all Republicans of moral cover. Evasion and cowardice has prevailed over conscience. We are now, and shall indefinitely remain, the Party of Donald Trump.I will not contribute my name, my work, or my character to an utterly indefensible cause. No sensible adult demands moral purity from a political party, but conscience is meaningless without constraints. A party willing to lend its collective capital to Donald Trump has entered a compromise beyond any credible threshold of legitimacy. There is no redemption in being one of the  good Nazis. I hereby resign my position as a York Township Republican committeeman. My thirty-year tenure as a Republican is over. Ladd is absolutely right. The Republican Party has shattered any claim they had of being the morally superior party precisely because they are supporting a man who does not share their values. Furthermore, they are supporting a man who uses fear as a political tool and has a pessimistic view of America.This is not a sign of good news for the Republican Party or Donald Trump. Trump has seriously created a rift in the party between moderate Republicans and conservatives that could cost the GOP dearly on Election Day. The Republican Party needs more than just their base to win a general election and that means they need moderate voters like Ladd in order to have a chance at winning.If more people like Ladd continue to leave the Republican Party because of Donald Trump, the GOP is finished.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Luckily, we have Elizabeth Warren to help us do that.While appearing on CBS  Late Night with Stephen Colbert immediately following Trump s speech, Warren (who has been rumored as a potential VP choice for Hillary Clinton), slammed the Republican candidate for sounding like a  two-bit dictator  and chided him for his divisive rhetoric: What Donald Trump says is there s a problem out there and what you have to understand is that it s all about each other. What you need to be afraid of is every other American. I ve got to tell you, that speech tonight, he sounded like some two-bit dictator of some country that you couldn t find on a map. Through the applause and a hilarious  defense  of Trump from Colbert, Warren doubled down: He sounded like a dictator of a small country rather than a man who is running for the highest office of the strongest democracy on the face of the earth. That s what he sounded like. And just like that, Elizabeth Warren summed up exactly how we all feel. To put it plainly, as Warren did,  Donald Trump is a bad guy. Elizabeth Warren has been a special thorn in Donald Trump s side. No one, not the media or even Hillary Clinton, has gotten under Trump s skin more than she has. An attack dog in her own right, Warren has been absolutely spot on in her criticism of the potential fascist-in-chief: he s a thin skinned, dictating fraud.We learned earlier this week that Trump has no plan to actually take on the domestic or foreign roles needed to make a great president.

You know, listening to this, I was struck by two things that I always believed during my two decades in the Republican politics. One, the voters always get it right. And two, the Republican Party that I worked for for two decades died in this room tonight. We are now represented as a party by a man who believes in protectionism, isolationism and nativism.

A U.S. military veteran, his family reports that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder while serving in the military.On the night he was arrested, Williams  family had taken him to a hotel in Owasso, OK, because he was having marital problems and experiencing symptoms of mental illness. His family states that he had not slept in days and was threatening to kill himself. While at the hotel, Williams reportedly caused a disturbance, resulting in Owasso police being called to the scene.Once police arrived, Williams failed to comply with the officers  orders, threatening to kill himself. Instead of waiting for mental health professionals, deputies pepper-sprayed him and placed him under arrest.Once he was in police custody, court documents show that Williams began to slip further into his mental illness. He stripped himself of his clothing, crawled under a bench and began barking like a dog. The Frontier reports that he was transferred from the Owasso jail to the Tulsa jail, after these events.In spite of repeated threats of suicide, Williams was never placed on suicide watch. Instead, he was placed in a regular holding cell. Less than an hour later he rammed his own head into a steel door. He fell to the floor and began crying out for help, telling jail staff that he couldn t move and that he had broken his neck.Over the course of the next ten hours, Williams remained motionless on the floor of the holding cell. He received no medical attention during this time. The Frontier reports that multiple staff, including jail supervisors, were aware of Williams  condition.The following morning Williams was visited by the jail nurse. Instead of providing medical attention, the nurse cussed at and berated Williams, telling him that he should be  ashamed  of himself, to get his  nasty ass  in the shower, and to  quit fucking faking. A short time later, two officers placed the paralyzed man on a gurney. According to court documents, they then dumped Mr. Williams off the gurney into the shower where Williams hit his head with a  smack.  Williams was left in the shower for three hours, unable to move.Over the next three days, multiple members of the jail staff expressed concern about Williams  condition. No one called for outside help or provided him with adequate medical treatment. During this time, a detention officer had to  pour water into his mouth  and feed him by holding his head up.An LPN, Raymond Stiles, reportedly checked on Williams during this time. It is not clear what kind of treatment or examination Stiles provided to the paralyzed man, but in a  progress note,  written after the visit, the nurse wrote Wants to be waited on. On October 24, Williams was also briefly visited by John Bell, a member of the jail s mental health staff. Williams told Bell he was paralyzed and told him  I want water.  Bell s notes state that he provided Williams with  coping skills education. On October 25, Williams was seen for 12 minutes by Dr. Stephen Harnish, the jail psychiatrist. Again he repeated his claim that he had broken his neck and could not move. Harnish also ignored his condition. As noted in the court records: Instead of providing or ordering medical care, Harnish ordered jail staff to place Mr. Williams in Medical Cell number 1, which would be his burial crypt.   The remainder of Williams  life was recorded by a video camera. Watch the video below, courtesy of The Frontier.On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge John Dowdell ruled that a lawsuit filed by Williams  family could proceed.In his ruling, Dowdell stated: A reasonable jury could find that Mr. Williams  needs were obvious to any layperson. They could also find that the medical unit-wide attitude of inhumanity and indifference shown to him, which resulted in the delay and denial of medical care in the face of his symptoms that were obviously indicative of a serious medical condition or medical emergency, amounted to deliberate indifference.

The hashtag #TrumpIsWithYou was added for effect, likely because there is a sentiment in the white nationalist community that Trump is, indeed, with them.This is running on the tweet screen loop here at #RNCinCLE check out the account. pic.twitter.com/9kgpzBLrlK  Andy Aplikowski (@AAARF) July 22, 2016Here are some other tweets from that account:.@Lesdoggg is your typical, entitled black woman:She dishes out plenty of hate to whites, but cries \""racist\"" when they hit back!#FreeMilo  Western Triumph (@Western_Triumph) July 20, 2016So some ugly, talentless, sheboon from Ghostbusters went crying to @Jack, to make twitter her personal safe space?

Western Triumph (@Western_Triumph) July 9, 2016Western Triumph also retweets Trump incessantly. It took all of 30 seconds to find those   and with as choreographed as the RNC was, one would be quite naive to think they didn t check out and approve tweets that were displayed for the crowd.This isn t the first or the second time the Trump campaign has given voice to white supremacists. In a single week in January, more than half of Trump s own retweets were white supremacists praising him. In December, The Donald participated in attacks on African-Americans with a disgusting graphic misrepresenting black crime rates. The billionaire, who has been known to keep a book of Adolf Hitler s speeches by his bedside, has (over time) won the unwavering support of racists across the nation with his promises to build a wall to keep brown people out, ban Muslims from the country, and force Muslims who are already here to wear special little badges and be entered into a national database. Even concentration camps are not out of the question as far as he is concerned. Hell, he s even told his bigoted, violent supporters he will pay their legal fees if they brutalize black people at his rallies.While the RNC, and Trump, will likely classify this as an  oversight,  the rest of us need to see it for what it is: the latest in a long pattern of Trump promoting white supremacists. While it was once limited to his own campaign, he has now taken their cause national.It is imperative that we do not allow this to happen.

Well, now they are going to take a huge hit to the state s economy as the National Basketball Association has pulled its All-Star game out of Charlotte over the law. The sports organization said that it would be unable to host the convention while the law is on the books and being enforced. They said in a statement: Our week-long schedule of All-Star events and activities is intended to be a global celebration of basketball, our league, and the values for which we stand, and to bring together all members of the NBA community   current and former players, league and team officials, business partners, and fans.While we recognize that the NBA cannot choose the law in every city, state, and country in which we do business, we do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by HB2. As expected, Pat McCrory, like the good, small-minded bigot that he is, struck back and blamed liberals for the consequences of his own bigotry: The sports and entertainment elite, Attorney General Roy Cooper and the liberal media have for months misrepresented our laws and maligned the people of North Carolina simply because most people believe boys and girls should be able to use school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers without the opposite sex present. Twenty-one other states have joined North Carolina to challenge the federal overreach by the Obama administration mandating their bathroom policies in all businesses and schools instead of allowing accommodations for unique circumstances. Left-wing special interest groups have no moral authority to try and intimidate the large majority of American parents who agree in common-sense bathroom and shower privacy for our children. The Human Rights Campaign immediately came out to praise the NBA for their strong stand against bigotry. President Chad Griffin said: Today the NBA and Commissioner Silver sent a clear message that they won t stand for discrimination against LGBTQ employees, players or fans, said Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin in a statement.  The NBA repeatedly warned state lawmakers that their hateful HB2 law created an inhospitable environment for their 2017 All-Star Game and other events. Nevertheless, Governor McCrory, Senator Berger and Speaker Moore doubled down on HB2 and refused to undo their discriminatory and costly error in judgment. Every day that HB2 remains on the books, people across North Carolina are at risk of real harm. We appreciate the leadership of the NBA in standing up for equality and call once again on lawmakers to repeal this vile HB2 law. HB2 is nothing more than a strike at the LGBTQ community. These right-wing transphobes and homophobes are so afraid of LGBTQ people that they are literally policing who can pee. It s a level of bigotry and insanity that is unacceptable in our society, and businesses are sending clear messages that they don t reward open, overt, and deliberate discrimination. The NBA follows a long list of businesses and entertainers who have refused to enter North Carolina until they stop making discrimination a matter of law.Keep the pressure on, big business.

Don t shoot someone because they take off running. That s crazy. Warren was asked what roles hip-hop artists have in the movement.

But what happens when Trump is actually put through a clinical sanity test? Political commentator Keith Olbermann decided to find out.In a courageous attempt to understand the way Trump s disturbed mind works, Olbermann examined Trump using clinical psychology practices, which lead to his conclusion that Trump would not pass any of the  sanity  tests commonly used to identify criminal and antisocial tendencies.Olbermann released his findings on Thursday in Vanity Fair, and the results were not good for the future of America. The particular test Olbermann chose to evaluate Trump was  The Hare Psychopathy Checklist , developed by Canadian criminal psychologist Robert D. Hare, which serves as a kind of triage device to separate the injured from the tripping from the psychopathic. This particular test goes through 20 different personality traits, awarding points for each. Such traits include a grandiose sense of self-worth, pathological lying, lack of empathy, parasitic lifestyle, promiscuous sexual behavior, and a failure to accept responsibility for one s own actions. Just by that small sample of traits alone, you can probably already guess how Trump might have scored.The maximum amount of points you can get is 40, and clinical psychopathy is considered any score 30 or above. Trump scored a whopping 32   making him a certainty for a diagnosis of clinical psychopathy. Olbermann remarked on Trump s mental health: The implications are clear. Our Trumperor s New Clothes media rightly sees the latest Trump  event whatever it is this time as one of the most unbelievable developments in American political history. But the simple mechanics of following, reporting, and writing the proverbial  new high in low  every single day means that they could be missing one overriding truth about the health of the most remarkable presidential candidate since at least 1864. In short, our amateurs  exercise with the very professional Hare Psychopathy Checklist suggests that if you were betting on it, you d probably want to bet that Donald Trump couldn t pass a sanity test open book. If that isn t terrifying, I don t know what is. Trump is the GOP nominee, and although Clinton will probably wipe the floor with him in the election, the fact that someone as hateful and mentally unstable as Trump has gotten this close to the White House should worry us all.Here s a video from Olbermann, which goes through the test and Trump s results:Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It s easy to assume that every police department everywhere are working on ways to stop BLM in their tracks, but that s not true. There is at least one department that actually sees BLM quite differently.Earlier this week, Phoenix Black Lives Matter hosted a forum in which police officers, and other community leaders, were invited to speak. The Phoenix Police Department s assistant chief, Mike Kurtenbach, said outright: The Phoenix Police Department doesn t see Black Lives Matter as a terrorist organization. We view Black Lives Matter as a partner who holds us accountable.We stand with you to find solutions. There s no way to respond to that but with cheers, and Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton reinforced that by telling the diverse crowd that they re looking to have a very diverse police department, and they want people to apply to work in their department. More diversity can mean more accountability, which means changing policing for the better. Working with BLM as a partner, instead of fighting them as a terrorist group, also leads to better policing.We re full of people mostly conservative who believe that BLM is specifically waging a war against cops, though BLM actually decries that violence. They want to remain peaceful. Yet, our conservative leaders, particularly those at the Republican National Convention right now, scream about Black Lives Matter being inherently racist, as Donald Trump himself said. Then again, from a white supremacist, that s not too surprising, but it s disgusting that so many in the GOP agree with him.There s also Rudy Guiliani, who claims to have saved a lot more lives with his broken windows policy than Black Lives Matter ever did. He said: I don t see what Black Lives Matter is doing for blacks other than isolating them. All it cares about is the police shooting of blacks. It doesn t care about the 90 percent of blacks that are killed by other blacks. We don t see how he cares about black lives at all. New York City s broken windows policing model has led to a very, very racist department that targets members of the black community for really stupid stuff far more than white people.Then there are some police departments that see BLM as a threat, and any support of them as a gross insult, almost along the lines of people spitting on soldiers returning from a war they disagree with. For instance, the Somerville, Mass. department is calling for the removal of a Black Lives Matter banner from City Hall like it s the Confederate flag. Their union actually said: The Somerville Police Employees Association and its members are deeply troubled that the city continues to display the Black Lives Matter banner above the main entrance of City Hall. It is inconceivable to us as it is demoralizing that our city would propagate its support for this movement while standing silent over the seemingly daily protest assassinations of innocent police officers around the country. The people who cry,  All lives matter,  really don t get why the movement specifies the black community. Some lives in this country matter more than others here. Given the rate at which unarmed black people are shot by police, are arrested and incarcerated by our justice system, and how they re perceived as guilty until proven innocent, their lives matter considerably less than other lives.That is an undisputable fact.So it s very refreshing to see a police department that s willing to work with BLM on improving policing by seeing them as a partner in this, rather than as a hostile movement that incites terrorism and insults police officers by its very existence. We need a lot more of this.Featured image via Phoenix Police Department""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It s pure political theater. It s tidbit SoundBits that stick in voters  minds and fester until election day, polluting the electorate s ability to look at the facts in an objective, impartial manner. They know they can t really convict her, but if they can convince the people that they re right and the law is wrong, that s good enough for them.But in the eyes of the Republicans, whose only goal is to win and not govern, the court of public opinion is mightier than the courts that uphold the rule of law.There is no law and order with Republicans.

Let s just go through history here and time. Ted didn t sign a pledge. He didn t sign a pledge to support a nominee by convention. You know, this speech went further than Ronald Reagan went on Gerald Ford. It went further than Kennedy did for Carter. Here s the audio via Buzzfeed.Chris Christie is owned by Donald trump and he knows it. He probably even has Trump s name stamped on his ass. Christie spent a lot of his time bashing Trump on the campaign trail last year and even once promised to not endorse Trump after dropping out of the race.But Trump holding on to Chris Christie s balls does explain this look on his face on Super Tuesday.Featured image via YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The only problem is that the books are teaching young minds the Donald Trump message   that Mexicans are lazy and want to destroy the country.School textbooks in Texas have long been a source of controversy because Texas textbook writers play more than a little loose with facts. The books whitewash slavery and the Civil War, they completely ignore the existence of the KKK and of the Jim Crow era. They mention segregation, but only as a footnote and only as something that s not that bad.Texas science books teach creationism, that the earth is 6,000 years old and that there s no such thing as climate change. Now, they are teaching pure racism and xenophobia and kids across the nation could be learning those lessons.Not surprisingly, Republicans outnumber Democrats in the Texas Board of Education by two to one. Democrats have been trying for two years to create a Mexican-American studies program, which makes perfect sense since the majority of Texas public school children are Latino.Republicans on the board balked at the idea, but they finally caved, sort of. There are now Mexican-American studies, but they are as racist as a Donald Trump rally or as the GOP convention happening in Cleveland.(Attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Celina) Moreno and other activists are part of the new Responsible Ethnic Studies Text Coalition, which scrutinized the proposed textbooks and detailed what it described as  multiple factual errors.  The coalition said those included suggesting that Mexican culture promotes laziness, linking Mexican-Americans to immigrants who are not in the country legally, and characterizing leaders of the Chicano movement that advanced Mexican-American civil rights in the 1960s and  70s as adopting  a revolutionary narrative that opposed Western civilization and wanted to destroy this society. Industrialists were very driven, competitive men,  the textbook says, according to excerpts.  In contrast, Mexican laborers were not reared to put in a full day s work so vigorously. There was a cultural attitude of  manana,  or  tomorrow.' Source: My San AntonioRepublicans evan admit that they did it just to piss Democrats off.You ought to be careful what you ask for.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans found what Democrats have known for months: Texas  voter ID law, the strictest in the country, violates the Voting Rights Act because it places an undue burden on minority voters in the state   more specifically black and Hispanic voters.When the law was passed in 2011, over 600,000 Texas lacked the identification necessary to vote. As the Court correctly pointed out, the overwhelming majority of these voters were non-white.According to the New York Times:It was the fourth time in nearly four years that a federal court found that the Texas law discriminated against or disproportionately affected black and Hispanic voters.The ruling did not strike down the law in its entirety, leaving in place the heart of the law but requiring the state to accommodate those who will have a harder time obtaining the identification necessary.The Fifth Circuit also sent back to the lower courts a reconsideration as to whether or not the Texas legislature acted with intentional discrimination. Should it be discovered that it did, judicial oversight would be required if Texas sought to change their voting laws.It should also be noted that the Fifth Circuit is considered one of the most conservative Appeals courts in the country, with 12 out of 17 seats being occupied by Republican appointees, and four out of seven senior judges being Republican appointees.Of the 15 judges, senior and active, who heard the case, nine (including 5 Republican appointees) voted in favor of the people, not the racist government of Texas. When the majority of the majority opinion are Republican and tell you your state is racist, you might want to take a step back.The state of Texas has not confirmed if it will be appealing to the Supreme Court, which in April decided to leave the law intact but revert back to the lower courts, the Fifth Circuit. The Supreme Court did, however, issue a warning: should the law be muddied by the lower courts (yet again), the Supreme Court would not come to its aid.The Fifth Circuit s decision may be the final nail in the coffin to a shameful, racist, hateful law that had one purpose: purge as many blacks and Hispanics off the voter rolls as possible.Once again, voting rights have been protected. Will Republicans learn from it? Not at all. But are Republicans now weakened heading into the general election? Absolutely.Over 600,000 people were given back their rights, now they need to exercise them in November.Featured image via Stephanie Keith/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Sure, Cruz went so far as to endorse Donald Trump s ridiculous wall, but he stopped short of throwing his full weight behind The Donald, encouraging conservatives to vote their conscience.These words caused the vapid, paint fume-huffing Republican base to erupt in a chorus of boos as they demonstrated once and for all that they don t have, or don t care to acknowledge, their respective consciences.Trump crowd turning on Cruz pic.twitter.com/BCjUp2Aiv4  Graham Moomaw (@gmoomaw) July 21, 2016Yes, this was a terrible scene   almost something out of Black Mirror.

On Wednesday, the defeated 2016 Stupid Party contender stood on stage and proudly endorsed Donald Trump s wall, but while many were expecting him to endorse the billionaire himself, they were disappointed. And to those listening, please, don t stay home in November,  Cruz said, falling short of endorsing The Donald.  Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution. Naturally, this angered many Republicans including, apparently, GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. When Cruz tried to approach Adelson s suite, he was turned away at the door. Cruz was initially invited to join the Adelsons, but a senior aide to the Las Vegas casino magnate says that invite was rescinded when Cruz failed to endorse Trump. When he didn t endorse, they were stunned and disappointed,  Adelson aide Andy Abboud told CNN. We could not allow Ted Cruz to use the Adelsons as a prop against Donald Trump. The Adelsons support Donald Trump and made that clear. They like Ted Cruz, but there was no way the Adelsons were going to be the first stop after not endorsing,  he continued.

They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily lives. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son. And we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow. Because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them. Mrs. Obama, in her 2008 speech: Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don t know them, and even if you don t agree with them.

The controversy that you are talking about is not meaningful at all,  Manafort continued. He excused Mrs. Trump because she is not a political candidate and declared that his words are the final ones to be said on the issue.But Cuomo didn t let that slide. He asked Manafort why he keeps ignoring the fact that parts of the speech were plagiarized but Manafort only repeated himself, bragged about Donald Trump, and insisted the media move on.Cuomo slammed Manafort and the Trump campaign of for not liking the fact that they got caught and blasted them for not just admitting the truth, especially since Trump is constantly accusing Hillary Clinton of being a liar.  There s a pattern of denying the obvious,  Cuomo said.Manafort attacked the media in response and demanded that everyone move on from the controversy. Again, Cuomo refused to back down and he let Manafort know it in strong words. I can t move on because you keep lying about it! I have to talk about what is true!

It deals in witchcraft, which is  sinful  according to many Christians. Since the books first hit the shelves, there has been a small but vocal movement to ban them. The people calling for the bans, we can only guess, are likely some of today s Trump voters.Beyond the stories of sorcery, Harry Potter books have a single message: tolerance. That message is the antithesis of the Trump campaign. The story is entertaining, people like the characters in it and the lessons it teaches are far more subtle than hitting you over the head with what kind of political candidate you should support,  she said.  They re about respect for the opposition and all kinds of things that are pro-tolerance messages. Maybe the secret to a Hillary Clinton win is to have everyone read Harry Potter before the election.Featured image via Pexels.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Al Baldasaro, who is also Trump s adviser on veteran s affairs.On Tuesday, Baldasaro echoed other conservatives by calling for executing the former Secretary of State via firing squad for imaginary crimes conservatives think she is guilty of committing   even though there is no evidence that she ever committed a crime. House panels found nothing during their investigation of Benghazi and they couldn t find anything in their investigation into her emails either.Even the FBI couldn t recommend prosecution because there was nothing to go on.But Baldasaro and other conservatives don t care. They think they are judge, jury, and executioner. Hillary Clinton to me is the Jane Fonda of the Vietnam,  Baldasaro told a right-wing radio host.  She is a disgrace for the lies that she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in Benghazi. She dropped the ball on over 400 emails requesting back up security. Something s wrong there. Again, even the House committee headed by REPUBLICANS could not find any evidence that Hillary Clinton failed to respond to attacks in Benghazi in which four Americans were killed, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.In fact, even Stevens  own family does not blame Clinton.But regardless of the facts, Baldarsaro wants blood. He accused Clinton of committing treason and said she should be shot. This whole thing disgusts me, Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason. Here s the audio via BuzzfeedIn addition to right-wingers calling for Hillary to be shot, hanged, and imprisoned despite the fact that she has not committed a crime, Trump s delivery boy Chris Christie held a  mock trial  at the RNC Convention on Tuesday evening and charged her with crimes and let the crowd deliver verdicts. They chanted  Lock her up  and  guilty.  And this is all despite the fact that Christie himself is embroiled in a legal scandal of his own, which Hillary reminded him of on Twitter.Conservative hatred of Hillary Clinton has reached fever pitch and is extremely dangerous if left unchecked. Calling for the assassination of a political candidate is disgraceful and Donald Trump needs to tell his supporters that they are going too far. Because it is only a matter of time before a conservative gun nut actually attempts to put those calls into action.Featured image via YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He and his second in command, Lt. Col. Gerald Savoy, are accused of orchestrating the beatings of five pre-trial inmates in areas where video cameras couldn t catch them.Prosecutors allege Ackal directed deputies to assault the inmates   three in connection with a lewd comment to a deputy, one for writing letters complaining about jail conditions and a fifth for no stated reason   and was present in the chapel for at least one of the beatings.Source: The AdvocateEight inmates have died in the jail. One, the death of Victor White III is under federal investigation, and Reverend Victor White Sr., the father of the victim, says all evidence points to the fact that his son was beaten to death. Ackal was asked to step down, and his response was  it ll be a cold day in hell when I resign. Here s a video:Even beyond those accusations, Ackal is accused of antisemitic attacks against a federal prosecutor, calling him  Jew bastard,  and saying he s shoot the prosecutor between his  Jewish eyes. According to a transcript of portions of the recording filed into the court record, Ackal made reference to  this sorry son-of-a-bitch Jew bastard in Washington, saying he is going to send me to a federal pen. Ackal also talks about how prosecutors discussed a possible deal with the sheriff. You know about these people. You can give them to us,  Ackal said, recalling what federal prosecutors told him.  I said the only thing I m gonna give you   f*****g shoot you right between your g*******d Jewish-eyes-look-like-opossum bastard. No one is denying he made the threat.Source: The AdvocateIn fact, his only defense was that his words were said in a  fit of anger,  as if no one has ever done anything violent in a  fit of anger.  Because of his fit of anger, and the alleged beatings of the inmates, Ackal s guns were taken away and now he says he s a  sitting duck. In a court document filed this week, an attorney for the sheriff also claimed there was a threat made recently against a deputy. Though the threat against the deputy was not carried out,  the atmosphere in this country, especially in south Louisiana, makes this a very realistic possibility,  attorney John McLindon wrote. In view of what s happening across the country,   I think it s wrong that I, as a police officer, am told that I can t carry a gun even though I ve not been convicted of anything,  Ackal said Tuesday.It s absurd, but so very American, that this powder keg of a sheriff thinks he s entitled to his guns, despite what he s said and has allegedly done. It s doubtful that civilians, especially those of color, would ever get their guns back under similar circumstances, but this bigoted sheriff expects that his badge will give him special privileges, which is really a metaphor for our militarized police force.If Ackal is really in danger, which is possible given the accusations against him, a judge should put him in protective custody, either that, or give him back his guns and put the rest of the country in protective custody.Featured image via KLFY video screen capture.

Recently, a West Virginia lawmaker made national headlines when he said the former First Lady hung on the mall in Washington, D.C. Michael Folk, who also worked as a pilot for United Airlines, was suspended indefinitely after his words circulated and his employer was notified. But this sort of thinking, this violent desire to kill one s political enemies, is almost the norm in the GOP.Not only do we hear chants calling for Clinton s arrest and execution at GOP rallies (and even at the convention), but this sort of ugliness rears its head even in local politics. An Ohio lawmaker is under fire after he called for Clinton s execution   not because she has actually committed a crime   but just because he wants her dead.Licking County Commissioner Duane Flowers (R-epugnant), stood in a meeting of the board of commissioners and shared his thoughts Clinton Tuesday. Disgusted that the nation criticized Melania Trump for blatantly stealing part of Michelle Obama s 2008 Democratic National Convention speech, Flowers said that people should be focusing on hanging Hillary. During the meeting, he blurted out:Later in the day, after the criticism began to mount, he sad he regretted the remarks he made while  emotional. I got caught up in an emotional moment,  Flowers said.  She just totally makes my mind want to pop out of my ears. I really can t believe she s running for president. I m convinced 30 years ago, she d been locked up for life. I truly believe she has become above the law,  he added.  That s how far our system has fallen. Clinton, of course, has committed no crimes and the ones of which Republicans say she is guilty would not carry the death penalty (most of them, anyway). Unfortunately, Flowers seems to be a victim of right-wing media s incessant insistence that Clinton is a murderer and many other things she is not. As a Republican, Flowers has no choice given his mindset but to decide she should be dead.Fellow Republican and president of the board, Commissioner Tim Bubb, jumped in to defend Flowers after the remarks went public, saying that his buddy shouldn t be judged for publicly calling for the death of a high-profile political figure. I think he was on a rant and kind of venting,  Bubb said.  He sometimes wears his emotions on his sleeve. I hope you don t characterize it as that s all he is. There s a lot more to him than that. He s a good county commissioner.  Besides, he didn t mean for the public to find out about what he d said, Bubb explains: I don t think Duane meant it to be a statement on the record. We re fairly conversational, but it is a public session. We re not necessarily making statements for the greater world. Technically, we re in public session, and I guess anything you say is a public comment. People get caught up in this  R  versus  D  and blue versus red, and we should probably try to avoid that in public session and on the record,  Bubb said.  Every public official has to decide what they want to say. Unfortunately, contrary to these assertions, this sort of thing is normal for Republicans and the remarks are typically meant for the world to hear. They use statements like this to energize their rage-fueled base, to bring in votes, to keep the divide between Americans going as much as possible. Because the reality is that they depend on this sort of thing to get elected. It s simply what works with their base   and, unfortunately, the very people who want to murder someone when they get  emotional  are the ones who want to remove restrictions on gun sales.Think about that.Featured image via Licking County official website/Getty Images (Ethan Miller)""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

But several paragraphs concerning former presidential candidate John Kasich shows the true side of Donald Trump, one that Democrats have been trying to warn the American public about for over a year:One day this past May, Donald Trump s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., reached out to a senior adviser to Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who left the presidential race just a few weeks before   Donald Jr. wanted to make him an offer nonetheless: Did he have any interest in being the most powerful vice president in history?When Kasich s adviser asked how this would be the case, Donald Jr. explained that his father s vice president would be in charge of domestic and foreign policy.Then what, the adviser asked, would Trump be in charge of? Making America great again  was the casual reply.And there you have it. What exactly does he mean when he says  making America great again  if he doesn t want to do the only things needed? Trump doesn t want the responsibility of actually being president, he just wants the title and the prestige. Instead of taking it upon himself to deliver on his promises, he s going to dump everything on Mike Pence and sit back and relax while the world crumbles (because everyone knows that wall isn t being built).Congratulations, Republicans, you really picked a winner.

Trump.On the second night of the Republican National Convention, Trump s youngest daughter, Tiffany, exulted that her father was a hard worker who never gave up, never stopped dreaming, and never stopped achieving. Well, it turns out he gave up being president of the United States before he has even started.Donald Trump, time and time again, has shown himself to be a lazy, pandering, egomaniacal, narcissistic blowhard.

Trump s campaign says: It s an easy decision for Mexico: Make a one-time payment of 5 to 10 billion dollars to ensure that 24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year. The cash flow to Mexico that Trump is rambling on about here is a reference to Mexican immigrants living in America who wire money to help relatives in their native country. This is clearly something Trump doesn t like. He calls the practice of helping one s family financially if said family happens to live in Mexico  de facto welfare for poor families in Mexico.  Because of course he does. How will he stop people from wiring money? Well, he ll force each and every person who wishes to transfer any money at all to Mexico to prove to the government that they are here in the U.S. by legal means. Never mind the massive undertaking such an operation would be, of course. What Trump wants, Trump gets.If that isn t shocking enough for you, there s more. Trump says that if that isn t enough to make Mexico bankroll his silly wall, then he will turn to  canceling visas,  which is something he wants to do anyway because he calls the issuing of Visas to Mexican nationals one of our greatest leverage points  in this whole insane border wall plan.If the threatening of the visas of Mexican nationals currently in the United States and all the other nonsense he s laid out here doesn t force Mexico to submit to The Donald s authoritarian plan, then, by god, he ll jack the prices of visas and that will finance the wall to keep all those Mexicans from immigrating to the United States.If this so-called  policy  plan doesn t tell people how insanely dangerous Donald Trump is, there s nothing that will.

He encouraged Republicans to dispel  the notion that a Hillary Clinton administration wouldn t be that bad,  and said: It won t be four or eight years because she will be appointing people who will have an effect on generations, and America may never recover from that.

According to Twitter, it was Yiannopoulos who led the harassment campaign against Ghostbusters actor Leslie Jones that inspired the SNL cast member s decision to leave Twitter. The tweets, many of which targeted Jones for being black and a woman, were the final straw for Twitter, which is taking steps to try to solve its harassment problem.According to the company, the permanent suspension isn t a matter of speech as much as a matter of behavior   specifically, a violation of Twitter s rules regarding the targeted abuse of specific users.Yiannopoulos and his rabid fan base went after Jones because they view her role in the all-female Ghostbusters as an attack on men, and believe the movie should be attacked, no matter the merits of the film on its own.As a result, when the so-called  alt-right  pundit directed his followers to Jones, the actress received numerous tweets comparing her to a monkey or baboon and a torrent of racist and sexist epithets.Jones, frustrated that Twitter was not responding to clear violations of its user policy prohibiting such actions, began to post the threats she received as a form of protest against the company.

Silver acknowledges that Clinton s lead is now down to just 3 or 4 points, which is kind of frightening, but according to Silver, there s a 35 to 40 percent chance that Trump can pull it out. What s particularly disconcerting about that, though, is that Clinton has about the same lead in the polls that John Kerry did in 2004, and we all know how that election turned out.One big unknown is whether the spate of violence by and toward the police will continue. Right now, the Republican party is waging an effective campaign of telling Americans that we are in a race war and the only way for the majority (white people) to win, is by voting for Donald Trump. Then again, there are those of us who believe that the way to start a race war is to elect Trump.Featured image of Hillary Clinton by Alex Wong at Getty Images | Featured image of Donald Trump by Will McNamee at Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Perhaps it s a sign that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is going to be replacing Obama in the White House, because the GOP is already blaming the dumbest things on her   including Melania Trump s disastrous speech on the first night of the Republican National Convention.Melania s speech raised eyebrows last night as people immediately recognized how similar it was to First Lady Michelle Obama s speech from the 2008 Democratic National Convention. It was clear that a good chunk of the speech had been plagiarized, but don t expect Trump s campaign to take any responsibility for it. On CNN this morning, Trump campaign advisor Paul Manafort refused to acknowledge the obvious similarities and awkwardly denied any plagiarism. It was an uncomfortable interview with Chris Cuomo, and Manafort made it even worse by trying to blame it on Clinton. Manafort told Cuomo, who appeared stunned by what he was hearing, that Melania s speech was original: There s no cribbing of Michelle Obama s speech. I mean, these were common words and values  I mean, she was speaking in front of 35 million people last night, she knew that. To think that she would be cribbing Michelle Obama s words is crazy. Cuomo pointed out that the speech didn t just pull a few common words   there were word-for-word sentences that were taken from the First Lady s 2008 address. Here s  a few  similarities, as a Twitter user pointed out:TwitterThe truth is blatantly obvious, but Manafort continued to refuse to admit that there had been any sort of wrongdoing and tried to place the blame onto Clinton. He said: This is, once again, an example of what happens when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton. She seeks to demean her and take her down. It s not going to work.

As it turns out, she had been fired by Roger Ailes because she refused to have a sexual relationship with him.Her lawsuit alleges that Ailes relentlessly ogled her and treated her like a sexual object in the workplace. She faced constant sexual harassment from Ailes and her male colleagues and when she tried to get the harassment to stop Ailes told her it would all go away if she would just agree to let him have sex with her. She declined, so Ailes fired her from Fox & Friends and moved her to an unpopular time slot with a pay reduction and more work in order to force her to submit to his demand. After she continued to refuse, Ailes fired her from the network entirely. I have strived to empower women and girls throughout my entire career,  Carlson said in a statement.  Although this was a difficult step to take, I had to stand up for myself and speak out for all women and the next generation of women in the workplace. But other women on Fox News were not as brave as Carlson. They sided with Ailes and threw Carlson under the bus.But the most powerful woman on Fox News is no longer remaining quiet and that is bad news for Ailes.New York Magazine reports that Megyn Kelly has met with attorneys representing the Murdochs, who own Fox, and told them how Roger Ailes sexually harassed her when she was a correspondent for the network.According to two sources briefed on parent company 21st Century Fox s outside probe of the Fox News executive, led by New York based law firm Paul, Weiss, Kelly has told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. Kelly, according to the sources, has described her harassment by Ailes in detail.As New York Magazine notes, this is probably the reason why Kelly had remained silent in the wake of the scandal, waiting for the right time to strike. And if the sources are accurate, Kelly just delivered the death blow to Ailes  career with Fox.Ailes has reportedly been given an August 1st deadline to resign or he will be fired for just cause.And Murdoch s attorneys are not done investigating yet so there could be even more revelations to come.Meanwhile, the Paul, Weiss lawyers are attempting to interview former Fox employees who have stories of harassment but haven t spoken because they signed settlements with Ailes s Fox attorney, Dianne Brandi. 21st Century Fox is now waiving the NDAs to allow women to speak.If this report is correct it could spell the end of Roger Ailes at Fox News and that would be a good thing for everyone.

They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily lives. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son. And we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow. Because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them. Mrs. Obama, in her 2008 speech: Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don t know them, and even if you don t agree with them. And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation. Because we want our children   and all children in this nation   to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them. Clearly, this is not just a mistake, but Trump apologists and even members of the media are blaming speechwriters and campaign staff even though Melania Trump told Matt Lauer prior to the convention that she wrote it herself. So Melania is either a liar or lazy or both.And the hypocrisy was too much for Joy Reid to stand by and say nothing. Reid pointed out that if Michelle Obama s speech had been plagiarized she would not have been given a pass. I ll start by quoting a guy called Tom Nichols, who s a conservative and very prominent on Twitter, who said,  Ask yourself if Michelle Obama would have been given a pass had she done the same thing in 2008?  I think we re all very quickly passing the responsibility onto staff. Clearly, this is a campaign that is poorly staffed. I think that has been clear for a long time. But they sent Melania Trump over to Matt Lauer to say that she wrote it [the speech]. But we re immediately dismissing the idea that she had anything to do with it. I doubt that we would dismiss the idea that Michelle Obama had anything to do with it.She s an adult woman. She s grown up. She has participated in the delivery of this speech. She gave the speech. So I think you have to give responsibility   sure, to the staff, the campaign management has been poor here   but Melania Trump did give the speech and Michelle Obama wouldn t have gotten a pass. Here s the video via VidMe.Indeed, conservatives would have howled in rage had Michelle Obama plagiarized her speech. They would have said that it proved she is unqualified to be First Lady and they would not have tolerated any excuse. Let s face it, the difference here is that Melania Trump is the wife of the Republican nominee and her skin is white and that somehow makes it okay that she plagiarized her speech.

Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization? King went on to praise  western civilization itself  as solely the product of whites, citing western Europe and the United States as the product of white ingeniuity.The congressman failed to note the myriad of contributions made by blacks, Latinos, Asians, and other races, or that many of the white contributions he cited were made at the expense of slave labor using blacks, especially in the United States.King, who has been ranked one of the least effective members of Congress, has a history of controversial and off-the-wall comments.

In doing so, Ryan showed America that to him, furthering the Republican party s intolerant values and laws were more important than saving the country from an untrustworthy, dangerously unqualified reality TV star. At the same lunch, Ryan said: What I do know for sure is if we disunify, then we hand the left the country by default for another four years. I just don t want to be a party to that. I don t want to be complicit to that. So, instead, Speaker Ryan wants to be complicit to handing the country to an unqualified bigot.

Instead, Reince Priebus and the rest of the party brass refused to give these delegates a voice at all. Here is what Emineth had to say: I was on the Trump finance committee and I just resigned because that bully tactic is absurd. I just texted them right now. Why can t the people be heard? I ve been texting Reince for 10 minutes. He said we didn t have the votes. We had 10, 1l states. They peeled people back. They were calling delegations asking people to step off the committee. You don t do this in America. You do this in other countries. Despite the fact that the delegates had signatures from delegations of 11 states and followed the rules themselves to have a voice for the #NeverTrump movement, they were still denied the opportunity to speak. So, in other words, the Republican Party brass broke their own rules in their determination to crown Trump the official King of the GOP.Granted, the #NeverTrump people don t even have anyone to replace Trump even if their efforts were to succeed.

Obama declared that  justice will be done. That, though, wasn t convincing enough for Trump, who stated in a Fox News interview that somehow, Obama must be in collusion with the murderers because of his  body language. After Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy read Donald Trump a statement from a Cleveland police union president   which accused Obama of having  blood on his hands    Trump replied,  Well, it s true. I watch the president and sometimes the words are okay, but you just look at the body language and there s something going on. Source: NY MagazineHere s the video:When the hell did Donald Trump become a body language expert? Oh, he isn t.  Body language  is nothing but code. President Obama is black. To racists, and Trump, that means that he s anti-cop and he must be a member of the Black Panthers, just as all Muslims are terrorists and all Mexicans are rapists.For decades, and probably centuries, part of the country s narrative was that cops and black people don t mix. Who can blame the African-American community, really? The justice system has been rigged against them from the start.Of course, white people turn that around to prop up the image of black people as criminals; they only have problems with the justice system because they are lawbreakers. Of course, that s not true (more on that in a minute), but that doesn t stop those on the right, including their leader, Donald Trump, from playing that particular race card with the highly educated African-American President of the United States, who must hate cops, simply because he has black skin.Here are the ugly facts, and they don t bode well for the justice system:If I were African-American, I d be pissed, but Obama is the President of the entire United States, a fact that has made some civil rights leaders, like Dr. Cornel West, turn on him. Sure, Obama doesn t deny his race, but he knows injustice wherever he sees it, and the shootings of cops was unjust.  There was nothing in his  body language  but weariness from our seemingly increasing rash of violence.See for yourself:As for Trump, his rhetoric is only ginning up the violence, all while the President tries his hardest to soothe a nation being driven to crisis level, partly because of Trump.Featured image via Drew Angerer at Getty Images.

And the party s nominee for President of the United States, Hillary Clinton, is making it priority number one.In a video posted at the progressive gathering Netroots Nation in St. Louis, Missouri, Clinton pledged her support for a constitutional amendment that would overturn the 2010 decision, and will push for such an amendment in her first 30 days should she be elected.The former secretary also promised to enact an executive order that would require all government contractors to disclose their campaign contributions and require the Securities and Exchange Commission to require all publicly traded companies to disclose their contributions as well.The chances of a constitutional amendment overrunning Citizens United are slim should the House and the Senate remain Republican controlled. But polls show the public overwhelmingly wants money out of politics. Then again, the overwhelming majority of the public supports common sense gun legislation but that hasn t convinced the Republicans to do anything.One of the biggest arguments in the Democratic Primary was the use of money in politics. While both candidates, including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, supported a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, it was Clinton who received major backlash from progressives over hefty Super PAC contributions. CBS reported last month that her biggest PAC contributor, Priorities USA, had raised over $52 million in June alone, and currently has $150 million stashed away for general ads against Donald Trump.According to OpenSecrets, an independent government watchdog group, of the $314 million that Clinton has raised this election season, 27 percent of that came from Super PAC donations.The bottom line is this: yes, Hillary Clinton used Super PAC money to help fund her campaign and get this far in a very competitive race. But in the age of Super PACs (and now a billionaire mogul), a candidate needs money to win. Clinton recognizes this, and is pledging to put an end to the system that pollutes our elections.If anyone thinks a President Trump would end Super PACs, they are blissfully ignorant or totally blind.

As a part of the hardcore  religious  right, Pence was angry about the main character serving in the military.He complained: Despite her delicate features and voice, Disney expects us to believe that Mulan s ingenuity and courage were enough to carry her to military success on an equal basis with her cloddish cohorts,  wrote Pence.  Obviously, this is Walt Disney s attempt to add childhood expectation to the cultural debate over the role of women in the military. He later wrote: I suspect that some mischievous liberal at Disney assumes that Mulan s story will cause a quiet change in the next generation s attitude about women in combat and they just might be right,  Pence continued.  (Just think about how often we think of Bambi every time the subject of deer hunting comes into the mainstream media debate.) Pence went on to claim that Mulan proves that women shouldn t serve in combat: It is instructive that even in the Disney film, young Ms. Mulan falls in love with her superior officer! Me thinks the politically correct Disney types completely missed the irony of this part of the story. Yet in the film, while she does strike up a romance, she is also key to the victory of China over the invading Hun, repelling his attempted invasion and defending the life of the emperor, who rewards her for her bravery.Since the film s release, women have more options to them in the military. Under President Obama, all military positions are now open to women who are able to qualify for them, including in front line combat.Despite Pence s hostility to a cartoon character, he obviously doesn t hold a grudge as he has decided to run on a presidential ticket with one, albeit one less intelligent and capable than Mulan.Featured image via YouTube/Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Mike Pence, then a Congressman, and now the Republican governor of Indiana and our potential next Vice President, opposed the raise. A 41 percent increase in the minimum wage that is brought into the well of Congress without providing any relief to small business owners and family farmers is irresponsible and unwise,  he said.  It will harm both the wage payer and the wage earner. An excessive increase in the minimum wage will hurt the working poor. Source: Huffington PostHere s the video:Note that the minimum wage increased occurred before Citizens United, so before the Koch brothers had such a toxic effect on our political system. Still, as the above video proves, the strawman argument about the minimum wage has been around for a very long time, and it s very wrong. According to the Department of Labor:A July 2015 survey found that 3 out of 5 small business owners with employees support a gradual increase in the minimum wage to $12. The survey reports that small business owners say an increase  would immediately put more money in the pocket of low-wage workers who will then spend the money on things like housing, food, and gas. This boost in demand for goods and services will help stimulate the economy and help create opportunities. Fortunately, for the country, the 2007 increase passed in a bipartisan landslide. For small businesses, the law included tax breaks.Not surprisingly, Pence has strong ties to the Koch brothers, who have long fought any minimum wage increases, or really, any minimum wage at all. No doubt that s why Pence, even to this day, still fights raising the minimum wage, while Trump vacillates on the issue and Hillary Clinton supports raising it to $12 to $15 an hour.Featured image via Drew Angerer at Getty Images.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Chaffetz asked a question to the inspector general of the Intelligence Community Charles McCullough, to see classified emails Clinton is alleged to have had on a private email server on CSPAN3.McCullough said that he couldn t show the emails to Congress without getting permission from the agency that owns that information, which frustrated Folk.Folk said if a private person had done what Clinton did, then they would be put in prison, which contradicts the FBI decision to not charge Clinton for the email scandal, and related the case to the scandal involving former Central Intelligence Agency Director David Petraeus back in 2012.Source: WOWK.comHis employer isn t happy.

The legislation, which was designed to address current gaps in mental health services, such as a lack of qualified staff and a shortage of beds for patients in crisis, will now head to the Senate for approval.According to the non-profit organization Mental Health America more than 57 percent of people who are impacted by mental illness have not received treatment within the past year. On top of that, mental health facilities across the country report a lack of beds for patients in crisis. It s estimated that at least 100,000 beds would be needed to effectively address the needs of all patients.While Congress did not go that far, the legislation does increase funding for additional hospital beds. It also expands access to local mental health services, including treatment by a qualified psychiatrist. In addition, the bill provides for Medicaid to conditionally cover mental health services. It also allows parents of seriously mentally ill adults to access their son or daughter s medical records and treatment plans.According to NBC, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which was created to oversee the nation s mental health system, does not employ a single Psychiatrist. The legislation addresses this problem by providing funding for the agency to hire qualified staff. It also creates a new position,  Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders,  to head up SAMHSA. The person selected to hold the position must be a psychiatrist or psychologist.While mental health advocates say they would have liked the bill to go farther, most believe it would be a positive first step toward reforming America s failing mental health system.As NBC reports here, the bill is the most comprehensive mental health system reform package since the early 1960 s. The Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act (H.R. 2646) passed the House on July 6, with 422 representatives voting in favor and only two voting against.

It s blatantly unconstitutional.For some reason every Republican in America seems to think that President Obama has the power to declare war. And that means none of the Republicans who proudly carry pocket versions of the Constitution with them have never actually read it.Article I, Section 8 clearly states that ONLY Congress has the power to declare war. The Congress shall have Power . To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water That s what the Constitution says.But just like Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, who somehow became an attorney and judge, said on Friday when she whined about President Obama not declaring war on ISIS, Trump seems to think the president has that power.It s asinine, and it is something most people learn in middle school. If he wants to blame anyone for not declaring war he should blame Republicans in Congress. It s their job and if they are really that scared of ISIS they should do it.Oh, but there s more.President Obama can only do so much to fight ISIS without a declaration of war from the lazy bums who control Congress right now and he s doing it by ordering airstrikes, sending military advisers, gathering intelligence, authorizing drone strikes, and working with our allies. All of this is combating ISIS to the point where they are close to being forced underground and their recruiting and finances are suffering.And to hear Trump talk, that s all he plans to do as well. Trump avoided saying he would use troops in a ground war against ISIS but bragged that his intelligence network would somehow be stronger even though the American intelligence apparatus is the strongest it has ever been. I am going to have very few troops on the ground. Trump said.  We re going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need; which, right now, we don t have. We don t have the people over there. Trump also seems to think beating ISIS is as easy as surrounding them as if they are a country and he claims he ll get NATO involved. We re going to have surrounding states and, very importantly, get NATO involved because we support NATO far more than we should, frankly, because you have a lot of countries that aren t doing what they re supposed to be doing. We have to wipe out ISIS. First of all, ISIS is present in several countries. You can t just surround them. It s more complicated then that. Beating ISIS isn t going to happen in days, weeks, or even months. It s going to take a long time. We are talking about an organization that is scattered around.And no American president can just force NATO to do anything. And threatening to pull money or support from NATO just because you aren t getting your way isn t how international cooperation works. That s how spoiled brats act.Mike Pence then chimed in by blaming President Obama and Hillary Clinton for ISIS. The larger issue here is declining American power in the world. I truly do believe that history teaches that weakness arouses evil. And whether it be the horrific attack in France, the inspired attacks here in the United States, the instability in Turkey that led to a coup   I think that is all a result of a foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that has led from behind and that has sent an inexact, unclear message, about American resolve. Here s the video via YouTube.But President Obama did not create the atmosphere in the Middle East that allowed ISIS to rise in the first place. That responsibility falls at the feet of President Bush, who pushed for war in Iraq and the Republican-controlled Congress that approved it.The unnecessary war with Iraq destabilized the region and created a power vacuum that ISIS took advantage of. Plus, it was President Bush who signed the status of forces agreement with Iraq that led to the complete withdrawal of troops from Iraq.So not only does Trump fail at American government, he fails at American history, too.Featured image via Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Validated it with his very divisive statements and now we see an escalation. This has got to end. We need some leadership in this country. Well, that is not the case at all, obviously. President Obama recently pointed out that there is a problem with racial disparities in policing and the criminal justice system in the United States. Those are data driven, provable facts.Police like Loomis are a major part of the problem in this country. He is so desperate to prove that black lives do not matter to him that he blamed Tamir Rice for his own death at the hands of the police. An innocent child who was killed for by the police for playing with a toy gun.Loomis is right, we need some leadership in this country. We need people to rise up and continue to demand radical reforms in our criminal justice system. We need leaders in the police forces to admit that there is a problem and do something about it. That s the type of leadership we need right now.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XmWKbv_CowFeatured image via video screenshot ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He opened fire, killing one elderly patient and a hospital employee who was in the same room.As soon as they heard the sound of gunfire, two unarmed security guards reacted. Even though neither of the  good guys  had a gun, they brought the shooter down, managing to disarm him before he could injure or kill anyone else.The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old David Owens, of Titusville. Owens is charged with two counts of murder.The two shooting victims were identified as 88-year-old Cynthia Zingsheim, who was a patient of the medical center, and 36-year-old Carrie Rouzer, the staff member who was caring for Zingsheim at the time of the shooting.Police say there does not appear to be a connection between the victims and the shooter. They are referring to the incident as  extremely random.  Owens reportedly entered the hospital through the emergency room doors, then made his way to the third floor, where he started the shooting rampage.In a public statement Titusville police Chief John Lau praised the security guards who took Owen down, saying that  without a doubt  the two guards  saved more lives.  While police have provided few details about the shooter, or a possible motive, the chief s comments indicate that Owen had plans to continue with the shooting rampage, harming as many people as possible.This is not the first time that unarmed people were able to bring a shooter under control, without the use of a gun. As Addicting Info reported here, last year an unarmed West Virginia high school teacher managed to prevent what could have been another tragic school shooting, by talking down an armed student. Before that, another unarmed teacher stopped a potential school massacre at Taft Union High School in Georgia.In August of last year, an unarmed U.S. soldier stopped a potential mass shooting on a high speed train in France. In October, a group of unarmed college students took down the UCC shooter, who killed nine people on a college campus in Oregon and clearly intended to kill many others.As the LA Times reports here, there were just 259 justifiable homicides in 2012, compared to 8,342 criminal homicides using guns. That equates to .03 percent of  good guys  using a gun to stop a violent crime. Yet the NRA keeps telling us that  only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun.

How many law enforcement and people have to die because of a lack of leadership in our country? We demand law and order. It s now becoming a trend for Trump to exploit crimes against law enforcement to make himself look better to his racist tribe. He purposefully mentioned  law and order  in this Facebook post because after the Dallas attack, which left several police officers dead and many more injured, Trump called himself the  law and order candidate  in a speech addressing the Dallas attack. Trump had said: We must maintain law and order at the highest level, or we will cease to have a country. 100%, we will cease to have a country. I am the law and order candidate. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is weak, ineffective, pandering, and as proven by her recent e-mail scandal, which was an embarrassment, not only to her, but to the entire nation as a whole, she s either a liar or grossly incompetent. One or the other. Very simple. Following the Baton Rouge shooting, Trump also took to Twitter to vent and once again complained about how  divided  and  out of control  our country is (without considering how his hateful rhetoric and intolerant, racist values might be contributing to it).TwitterThis shooting is the second nationally-reported shooting in Baton Rouge this month, following the injustice of police brutality victim Alton Sterling, whose death inspired the shooting of police officers in Dallas. It s clear that the ongoing tension between law enforcement and the African American community is growing after these incidents, however to exploit these tragedies and use them to bash Obama is disgusting. If Trump would shut up and do his research for once, he would know that cops have never been safer than while Obama has been serving as President of the United States, and that the president is doing everything he can to keep our nation safe.TwitterFeatured image is a screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The low-frequency sonar employed by the Navy has been shown to harm dolphins, whales and other marine mammals.Friday s decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, which was later joined by environmental groups. The suit alleged that the lower court s decision to allow the use of sonar was a direct violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.The court agreed that the Navy s use of sonar in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea violates a section of the Act which requires all peacetime Oceanic operations to have the least practicable adverse impact on marine mammals. The court also found that guidelines set forth by the U.S. Fisheries Service did not give adequate protection to areas of the world s oceans flagged by its own experts as biologically important.  The court found the result to be that  a meaningful proportion of the world s marine mammal habitat is under-protected. As Scientific American reports here:Unfortunately for many whales, dolphins and other marine life, the use of underwater sonar (short for sound navigation and ranging) can lead to injury and even death. Sonar systems first developed by the U.S. Navy to detect enemy submarines generate slow-rolling sound waves topping out at around 235 decibels; the world s loudest rock bands top out at only 130. These sound waves can travel for hundreds of miles under water, and can retain an intensity of 140 decibels as far as 300 miles from their source.Studies show that the use of sonar can cause whales to swim hundreds of miles and even beach themselves in an attempt to get away from the sound. The use of sonar can also cause marine mammals to bleed from their eyes and ears. It can also cause temporary deafness, a condition which leaves animals vulnerable to predators and other threats. According to the Navy s own estimates, the use of low frequency sonar is expected to kill 170,000 marine mammals and cause permanent injury to more than 500 whales. An additional 8,000 would experience temporary deafness.The latest ruling, which bans the use of sonar entirely, is a huge victory for environmental and animal rights activists.Image credit: Whit Welles via Wikipedia cc 3.0""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The officer s dismissal from the police force came after multiple citizens reported a Confederate flag flying outside the man s home, while an official police vehicle sat parked in the driveway.According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Roswell police chief Rusty Grant has been working hard to improve relations between the police department and the local Black community. Grant has made it a point to reach out to the community by attending only African-American churches since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson Missouri.On July 10, Pastor Lee Jenkins of Eagle s Nest Church in Roswell, invited Grant and his department to worship with them. Grant accepted the invitation. In a statement to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Grant said: For me the takeaway from Ferguson was that a lot of African-Americans don t trust police officers and don t see them as I did when I was growing up. I honestly didn t know that before. I was ignorant of that. Everyone needs to work to make things better. A day later, however, an unidentified officer from Grant s department responded by erecting a Confederate flag on his property. While the first amendment protects the rights of citizens to display the flag, the officer parked an official police vehicle on the property as well. It was seen by numerous residents, who called the police chief to complain.On Thursday, the chief announced that the officer had been fired, saying: On the past Monday, July 11, we received a complaint about an unidentified Roswell Police officer. Based on the complaint, the Office of Professional Standards (internal affairs) did the investigation. After it was complete, I reviewed it and it was sustained by me and based on that, the police officer was terminated this past Thursday. While the police chief refused to provide further details, including the name of the officer, Pastor Jenkins told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that church members had also called him to report the Confederate flag. The pastor confirmed that Grant had fired the officer involved in those complaints.Members of the Black community applauded the decision. Fernandez Anderson of Lawrenceville told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: I commend Chief Grant for being a man of integrity and a man of his word. He made his stand to say we must be better, we must do better. The chief had an open mind and didn t just look at it from a police angle, he looked at it from a neutral angle. Featured image via J.

Yet another foreign MP, UK member Peter Bottomley, says he reached out to the Trump family for an explanation for the spam. He said: Neither [Trump s] sons nor anyone else has answered my questions about how they acquired my email nor why they were asking for financial support that I suppose to be illegal for [Trump] to accept. Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer, who watches out for campaign finance violations, says of Trump s activities: This is kind of absurd. I don t know of anyone else in this situation who would just go on keeping on soliciting money from foreign interests. I think the fact circumstances here are unprecedented.If they are put on notice that their fundraising solicitations of potential foreign donors are illegal and they keep doing it, then you potentially have knowing and willful violations of the law which moves this from civil violations to criminal violations.It s open and shut that federal candidates can t solicit contributions from foreign donors. There s kind of an arrogance about this. It s Trump, so of course he s being arrogant. He s the man who literally said he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and people would still vote for him. He seriously believes he can do no wrong, and that apparently also includes flagrantly breaking the law in an effort to raise money for his pathetic, broke campaign.Larry Noble, an attorney for the Campaign Legal Center, described the Trump camp s illegal activities as  really outrageous,  and continued: It is a serious violation of federal law to solicit political contributions from foreign nationals.There is no reason this should be happening.

Exactly right. This is either incompetence or willful and knowing violation of federal law. Either way, everyone involved in this needs to be investigated and charged.

Sharlet answers, calling Pence a  broker  between the two. To understand Mike Pence and to understand that kind of religious conservative politics, you have to not think of social conservatism and fiscal conservatism as separate, but like Mike Pence say,  Our goal, our mission, is to marry fiscal and moral values.  He sees them as one in the same, so when you go back in his record and you look at his speeches about abortion, which are really something, Sharlet answered.  He is probably the most anti-abortion presidential or VP candidate we ve had. You see him also bringing in financial. He sees it if we don t stop abortion, our economy will collapse. So he s the guy who sort of stands in the middle between those two factions of the Republican Party. At that point, Reid brings up Pence s record regarding abortion, Planned Parenthood, and his failures as a leader during a recent HIV outbreak, saying: On abortion, he signed a law as Indiana governor banning abortions because of genetic anomalies, abortions that were unfortunate anomalies, and he also signed a law mandating, and this is weird, women who have a miscarriage or an abortion had to have a burial for the fetus and must cremate after a miscarriage or abortion. On LGBT rights, he signed a law allowing religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination in lawsuits, and then after a backlash, he s revised the law to exclude LGBT discrimination which got him in trouble with conservatives in Indiana. On prison, he reinstated a ten-year mandatory minimum drug sentencing,  said Reid.That s only a small sampling of what Sharlet and Reid had to say about Pence s record. It s very clear that the GOP has no interest in supporting even a faux-moderate candidate this election judging by the support he is receiving.The bottom line is that Pence is too dangerous to allow into office.

Neither RNC organizers nor Trump s campaign immediately responded to the Daily News  request for further comment.The  white  banners are eerily similar to the signs that once kept America segregated: Everything from bathrooms to restaurant entrances were labeled for  white  and  colored  use until segregation was abolished in 1964.City officials in Cleveland have expressed concern about the mix of anti-Trump protesters and pro-Trump forces, who have also promised that they plan to carry weapons with them, as Ohio is an  open carry  state.One of the groups who had previously promised to attend the convention was a white supremacist group, who was also involved in a protest that broke out into violence in California. The head of that group, the Traditionalist Worker Party, has said they have been attracted to Trump s campaign because they believe that he has tapped into their key issue: immigration.Trump and the Republican Party face an uphill climb among black voters. While Mitt Romney attracted six percent of the black vote in 2012, even without President Obama on the ballot (he has endorsed Clinton), Republicans are still viewed with skepticism   and the party s support of voter identification laws that suppress the black vote don t help.Recent state polling showed Trump receiving ZERO black votes in key swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.Featured image via Twitter""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This pitiful blunder will live on, if only for our amusement. In the future, Trump s campaign would be well advised to use a different design company when it comes to creating their logos.

Instead the candidate did what comes most naturally to him: Talking about himself. Trump went on and on discussing his path to the nomination, again reliving the only political victory he s had so far, triumphing over the weak 2016 Republican presidential field.2. He Gave A Lecture About TurkeyTrump then blamed the attempted military coup in Turkey on President Obama and his presidential rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He claimed,  We re seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. 3. He Tried To Stop Rumors He Didn t Want PenceThen Trump decided, for some reason, to use the event to push back on reports from outlets that indicated that Trump was considering changing his mind on Pence. Trump said,  Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice. In fact, the New York Times has reported that Trump  settled  on Pence.In conversations late into the evening, Mr. Trump repeatedly hesitated over selecting Mr. Pence, according to people briefed on the tense deliberations, who insisted on anonymity to describe the confidential talks. Even as his emissaries reassured Mr. Pence, Mr. Trump fielded a last-ditch appeal from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, another finalist, who once again pressed his own case.Advisers and family members stressed over and over to Mr. Trump that he was selecting a running mate to unite the Republican Party, not a new best friend.4. He Kept Talking About HimselfIn a moment that was quickly mocked on social media, Trump proclaimed  Back to Mike Pence,  then kept on talking about himself and the campaign.Is Pence even there? pic.twitter.com/bMBqyi1y4V  Joe Strupp (@JoeStrupp) July 16, 2016Trump has been speaking for 23 minutes.

He Abandoned Pence On StageHistorically, when candidates have introduced their running mates, they remain on stage with them during their remarks in a sign of unity and coming together. But Trump continued his campaign s themes of being in it for himself.

Now, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush has become the latest to go on record saying that he is most definitely #NeverTrump.On Friday, Bush took his anti-Trump sentiments to the Washington Post, where he said that Trump had tapped into anger and frustration in Americans: They have given rise to the success of a candidate who continues to grotesquely manipulate the deeply felt anger of many Americans. Trump s abrasive, Know Nothing-like nativist rhetoric has blocked out sober discourse about how to tackle America s big challenges. Bush then continued to slam Trump throughout the article, and cautioned fellow Republican politicians about the tone of Trump s campaign and the stain he was putting upon the party. He then went on to beg them to reintroduce civility, ideas and optimism back into politics. Let s find ways to campaign and govern inclusively. Let s find ways to ease the angst and fear of people, without cynically feeding it. He then went on to say that he would not be voting for either Trump or Clinton, but might go for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson: I haven t decided how I ll vote in November   whether I ll support the Libertarian ticket or write in a candidate   but I do know there are a lot of things Republicans can do in the coming months to lay the groundwork for rebuilding our party and the foundation for a true conservative renewal in our country.

Furthermore, has been firm that Mexico will pay for that wall   a claim that has been disputed by multiple former presidents and the treasury secretary of our southern neighbor. I will say it emphatically: There is no scenario in which Mexico will pay for this wall that is being proposed by the United States presidential hopeful, Mexican Treasury Secretary Luis Videgaray said in March. But that hasn t stopped Trump and his followers from pushing the issue right into the official Republican Party platform. In other words, this is not just Trump s dream. This is now something that every Republican across the nation will attempt to accomplish. This is really happening, people.But who will pay for it? The short answer is that we, the taxpayers, will. But if Trump is elected and we manage to once again hand Congress to the GOP, and every single one of them remains as stupid as they are today, we ll have to deal with one issue: where will we get the materials?Trump s border wall is a goldmine for southern building materials manufacturers   a $700 million chunk of the more than $10 billion cost of the wall at the low end is some pretty sweet lucre, after all   but the sheer demand will likely outweigh the supply by far. In fact, a recent report by Bloomberg notes that  one of the biggest beneficiaries  might be Cemex SAB, a company that is not exactly in the United States. In fact, as production progresses, they might have to figure out a way to get materials over the wall so construction can continue:The largest cement maker in the Americas would be  best positioned  to profit from such a large construction project, according to a report by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Other likely beneficiaries include another Mexican company Cemex owns a stake in, Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua SAB, as well as Martin Marietta Materials Inc., Vulcan Materials Co. and CalPortland Co.The project would enrich suppliers of building materials in the border region, Bernstein analysts led by Phil Roseberg wrote in the report. The wall proposed by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee would probably emulate the design of a barrier separating Israel from the West Bank, much of which was built with precast concrete panels, they said. The potential cost of the wall with Mexico: $15 billion or more. As ludicrous as The Trump Wall project sounds (to us at least), it represents a huge opportunity for those companies involved in its construction,  Roseberg said in the report.  Despite arguments concerning which government will pay for construction, the large quantities of materials required may necessitate procurement from both sides of the border. The wall itself isn t the only challenge. Roseberg says that roads would need to be built just to gain access to the more remote areas the wall would touch. But not to worry   Cemex has operations on both sides of the border to satisfy all of Trump s needs.But why Cemex? Roseberg s team explains: It is not economically feasible to transport heavy building materials over large distances. As such, it is the companies with production facilities closest to the border that stand to gain the most as suppliers to The Trump Wall project. Bloomberg notes that the wall would need 7 million cubic meters of concrete if it extends 1,000 miles, rises 40 feet and reaches 7 feet underground. these numbers could rise if the wall keeps  getting 10 feet taller  like he says seemingly every time someone irritates him. We have assumed that planning and land acquisition would take 1-2 years with a further 2 years for construction itself,  Roseberg s team says.  This means that the impact on demand for materials would occur from 2018 at the earliest. Looks like those  rapists  and  murderers  in Mexico will be laughing all the way to the bank if Trump s wall is built.Watch Trump talk about his stupid wall below:Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Snyder s new corporate shill, Heidi Grether, is a former executive for BP. Grether also worked as a registered lobbyist for BP America in Michigan for seven years. After her time spent lobbying for big oil, Grether became the Deputy Director of the MDEQ.The former DEQ director, Dan Wyant, resigned from his position after the Flint water crisis. Grether has been working as the interim director for the MDEQ since Wyant s resignation. Heidi has decades of experience in environmental quality issues, and has effectively served during times of crises and recovery,  Snyder said in a statement.  Her expertise in delivering good customer service from a large organization will be of great value as we continue working to reinvent the department and act more proactively to address issues that arise. The Snyder administration is already facing a huge backlash to the decision from environmental groups. Lisa Wozniak, Executive Director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters sent Snyder a letter informs them of their positions on major environmental concerns in the region. Our coalition articulated that this critically important agency is in need of someone who has the background and experience to be a strong advocate for the health of our communities and our environment. Today s announcement seems to fly in the face of that vision,  Wozniak said.Democrats are incredulous over Snyder s decision. Brandon Dillon, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said Snyder  has again shown he is completely out of touch with the people of this state and the problems they face. Flint is still reeling from the worst man-made environmental disaster in Michigan s history, yet Rick Snyder decides to tap a former BP executive   one of the worst polluters in the world   to lead our state s Departmental of Environmental Quality?  Dillon went on to ask.Because of Grether s almost decade long career of lobbying for the oil industry, she is already being asked to recuse herself from making judgments on one of the biggest decisions Michigan has to make in the near future. There is an oil pipeline that is located at the bottom of the Mackinac Straights, which connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The pipeline is very old and if it breaks down would create one of the worst if not the worst environmental disaster in human history. It would contaminate the world s largest freshwater supply and be economically devasting to the United States and Canada.It s appalling, though not surprising that Snyder would pull a move like this.

Many Republicans are opting out of attending the event with the exception of an underwear model, Gov. Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie and Ben Carson. And now, Ivanka Trump s Rabbi has decided not to attend.Politico obtained an email from Rabbi Haskel Lookstein to his congregation in which he explained after a backlash that he accepted an invitation from Trump s daughter to deliver the convocation in Cleveland  out of respect for her and our relationship. But that s all changed now and he explained to his congregation why he had a change of heart.Politico reports: Unfortunately, when my name appeared on a list of speakers at the convention, without the context of the invocation I had been invited to present, the whole matter turned from rabbinic to political, something which was never intended,  wrote Lookstein, who also served as the principal of the prominent Orthodox Jewish school Ramaz.But there may be more to it than that   like the backlash that ensued when it was revealed that Lookstein was to speak at the convention.Earlier on Friday, the Jerusalem Post reported that 600 Ramaz alumni had written Lookstein a letter, condemning his decision to speak at the convention.  This is the single action history will remember you by, and history will not be kind,  it read.Lookstein noted in the email the prayer he intended to deliver at the convention, which reads, in part: We thank you for our constitutional government that has created and fostered the American ideals of democracy, freedom, justice and equality for all, regardless of race, religion or national origin. Almighty God: We know that we are living in very dangerous times, when all of these blessings are threatened from without, by forces of terror and unimaginable brutality, and from within, by those who sow the seeds of bigotry, hatred and violence, putting our lives and our way of life at risk. He was seriously going to say that at the divisive GOP candidate s convention. With Ted Cruz, Huckabee and Trump in the room, he was going to speak against bigotry? Wow. That would have gone as well as Ted Nugent speaking at the Democratic Convention. That is, if we even believe the Rabbi s excuse. The letter penned by 600 Ramaz alumni likely had something to do with Lookstein s decision.The Donald is having a very bad day. Tim Tebow released a video in which he strongly denies a story circulated by Trump s presidential campaign that he will be a speaker at the Republican Convention. Many GOP leaders as well as rising stars in the party are opting out of speaking at the event. However, Trump does have his family members penciled in to offer praise for the hotel magnate. And that includes Ivanka   but without her Rabbi.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Patrick,  he responded.A moment later the officer says,  What s your name? I m going to ask you one more time. O.K  Patrick,  Mumford responds. We probably need to talk to you,  the cop tells him.  So, what s your name? Uh  Patrick?  Mumford responds.The officer orders Mumford to get out of the car. Mumford, who is clearly worried, asks,  What happened? What did I do? You got a warrant,  the cop says. I just came back from my probation officer,  Mumford tells him.At this point the officer directs another cop to use a taser on him.Mumford refuses to get out of the vehicle and demands to see the warrant.The officer then starts counting down,  three  two  one.  They tase him twice, dragging him out of the vehicle and slapping handcuffs on him. All the while Mumford is insisting there is no warrant for his arrest.  How can I have a warrant and my probation officer not tell me?  he asks.At this point, the cops finally get around to checking his identification. They quickly realize that Mumford is not the man they were looking for and immediately begin to try to cover their own asses.One of the officers can be heard insisting to the crowd of bystanders that has gathered around that Mumford looks exactly like Michael Clay.The cops insist that they asked Mumford for his ID  three times,  but claim he refused to provide it. A few seconds later, the cops claim they asked for ID  four times. As the video shows, the police never once asked Mumford for his ID.Watch the video below, courtesy of the Claiborne Firm on YouTube. As Mumford s attorney, Will Claiborne told the Daily Beast: The problem is Patrick Mumford doesn t look like Michael Clay, he ain t Michael Clay, and they roll up on him like he is.

Not only did he claim that there were hundreds of Muslim-controlled  no-go zones  across Europe, which Fox had to apologize for, he claimed that Muslims had 19 paramilitary training facilities in the Unites States.In January, Simmons appeared on Fox and called for surrounding these non-existent  no-go zones  with razor wire and shutting off utilities until all the Muslims surrender to be categorized by authorities.  That s how you close these no-go zones,  he said before using his false expertise to scare Americans with lies. It is incomprehensible that anywhere in the United States, these types of things would be allowed and, yet, my friend Ryan Mauro, as you probably know, reported that through the Clarion Project that we ve got at least 19 paramilitary Muslim training facilities in the United States. Are you kidding me? What are, what are they gonna do, go hunt deer during deer season? No. They re using paramilitary exercises to plan and execute these types of operations all over the United States. Here s the video via YouTube.But Simmons was soon outed as a fraud and now he gets to become a real expert at how to survive in prison.On Friday, Simmons was sentenced to serve 33 months behind bars portraying himself as an  Outside Paramilitary Special Operations Officer  for the CIA for nearly 30 years to get jobs within and outside of the government, which included his stint on Fox News and being sent to Afghanistan as an intelligence adviser.The 62-year-old was also sentenced by U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III to three years of supervision after his eventual release. He must also surrender two firearms and pay $176,000. Wayne Simmons is a fraud,  U.S. Attorney Dana Boente said.  Simmons has no military or intelligence background, or any skills relevant to the positions he attained through his fraud. Simmons frightened Americans for years through his appearances on Fox News and he put the lives of our troops in danger because of his lies.It makes one wonder how many other Fox News  experts  should be in prison right next to him.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He made several racist comments during the encounter, and asked him if he  knew about Guantanamo Bay. Later Kilgore attempted to break down the door that separates Moudgil s apartment from the motel office, but was unsuccessful. He then tried to enter through a second door, located on the first floor. Moudgil locked all the doors and windows to the apartment. Kilgore managed to get inside through a sliding glass door, which he reached by going to the roof of the motel.Once inside the apartment, Kilgore began threatening the family at knife-point. He said  I m going to cut you up because you are a terrorist,  Moudgil told the Spokesman-Review.  All he saw was brown skin. Kilgore shoved Moudgil s elderly father, turning the knife on him. He told the family,  I was trained to kill people like you. Moudgil s father eventually managed to escape the apartment. His mother fled through a back entrance as well, taking the three-year-old child with her.According to the Spokesman-Review, a neighbor finally managed to subdue the man, wrestling the knife away from him before he was able to seriously injure someone.Kilgore was arrested and is facing two counts of second-degree assault, one count of burglary and one count of malicious mischief. Additional charges may be added in the future. He is currently being held on $100,000 bond.Moudgil says that he has lived in the Kettle Falls community for years.  This community is very small.

Yet he says that he has never heard anything like this happening in the community before.The rise of racist, right-wing hatemongers like Donald Trump, who spew anti-Muslim ignorance and bigotry on a national platform, is undoubtedly linked to the growing number of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the U.S.As The New York Times reported here, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of attacks against members of the Muslim community over the past 10 months.As long as people like Donald Trump are allowed to spew their hateful, racist views on a national stage, the situation will only continue to get worse.Image credt: Viktoria-Lyn Deviant Art CC 3.0 ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

If this President would stop apologizing for what we do and what we are and stop saying  you Christians, it s your turn  as he did at a prayer breakfast then maybe American would be united in a way that we understand that they re coming. They re here. I gotta tell ya. I m as aggravated as everyone who has sat in this chair today. We ve got a problem at the top of this country,  Pirro continued before summing President Obama s legacy as  weak. One word: Weak,  she said.  He just doesn t have a plan. He doesn t have a policy. He should be in academia. We ve got to declare war on them. We ve got to start having a conversation about surveillance on mosques  they just want to kill us! Here s the video via YouTube:President Obama has never apologized for America. Nowhere is this clearer than when he visited Hiroshima, Japan and refused to apologize for the United States dropping the atomic bomb during World War II. President Obama is also not persecuting Christians. His policies include all Americans and do not target a specific religious sect.Furthermore, President Obama has done the best he can to fight ISIS with the authority and resources he has available and that has resulted in 26,000 ISIS fighters and half of their commanders being killed by United States and coalition forces.And if Pirro really wants to blame someone for being weak against ISIS, she should point her finger at Republicans in Congress who refuse to exercise their power to declare war on ISIS, which would give President Obama the full power to wage war against ISIS. But Republicans don t want to do that because they would rather put all the responsibility on President Obama so they can continue blaming him for each and every terrorist attack that occurs around the world for cheap political points.Just so Pirro and every other conservative out there understands what the separation of powers means, here s the part of the Constitution you are blatantly ignoring. Because it s either that or you ve never actually read the document you claim to love so much.Article I, Section 8: To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water.Seriously, Republicans need to grow a pair and do their jobs if they really believe ISIS is a major threat to our country.

President Obama said,  I condemn in the strongest terms what appears to be a horrific terrorist attack in Nice, France, which killed and wounded dozens of innocent civilians.

Politico reports that among those who have backed out of the convention are:David Koch ($1 million), FedEx ($500,000), Visa ($100,000) and both Pepsi ($500,000) and Coca-Cola ($1 million).What isn t explained is why the RNC is hitting up casino billionaire Adelson for this money, when according to his claims about his net worth, $6 million should be no problem for Donald Trump. The incident again raises the question of whether Trump is telling the truth about his net worth or not. He refuses to release his tax returns, so no independent assessment of his wealth is available, though he has previously testified to being far less wealthy than his current $10 billion claim.The funding shortfall is just the latest headache to hit the Republican convention.

But, it will also go down for being a year of anger. People on both the right and the left are angry about politics as usual, for good reason. Even some angry people on the left have vowed to vote for Trump because they see him as an outsider, or they are nihilists who want to tear everything down before building it back up.If you are a Trump voter, Dean has some choice words for you and they aren t exactly partisan. Dean was in Ohio campaigning Senate candidate Ted Strickland. Dean had some somewhat kind words about Ohio s Republican governor, John Kasich   mostly because Kasich has refused to endorse Trump. I disagree with your governor on a large number of issues but one thing I do not disagree with him on is supporting a lunatic for the president of the United States is not a good idea,  said Dean, a former Democratic National Committee chairman.He added that Kasich, unlike Republican Sen. Rob Portman, had  guts  for not endorsing the presumptive GOP nominee. Kasich has told reporters he would support Trump only if the businessman had an experience akin to Saul s conversion on the road to Damascus. Portman has endorsed Trump while condemning some of Trump s more controversial comments like attacking a federal judge for his Mexican heritage.Source: USA TodayWhile Dean didn t mention Bernie Sanders or Bernie or Busters, his next sentence seemed to be directed right at the people considering Trump over Clinton: Look, I understand people are mad at Washington. I m mad at Washington, but that doesn t mean you have to elect a crazy person,  Dean said.Recent polling has shown that the vast majority of Bernie supporters plan on voting for Clinton, but 15 percent are still either on the fence, vowing to not vote at all, or pledging to vote for another candidate, including Trump. This could be a close race, and that small percentage could mean the difference between a safe but not particularly revolutionary choice and a complete lunatic.

Planting PeaceThe timing is perfect   Planting Peace erected the billboard right as the Republican platform committee approved what is being referred to as the GOP s most homophobic party platform yet. To encourage Republicans attending the RNC to actually consider how the party s bigotry might be affecting America s youth, Planting Peace said: We challenge the GOP to think about how many times their children could hear messages like these and not be impacted or question their value and worth? These messages sink our young people into a spiral of depression and directly correlate to queer youth attempting or actually committing suicide. The blood of these children is on the hands of the anti-LGBT platform of the republican party. Planting Peace is the same non-profit that brought The Equality House, a rainbow-colored house sitting across the street from Westboro Baptist Church, into existence   so it was only appropriate that this equally troll-like statement like this would come from them. Aaron Jackson, the President of Planting Peace, said the sign was meant to attack the GOP s anti-gay agenda: What Donald, Ted and the Republican Party either fail to realize, or realize and just don t seem to care about, is that their words and actions toward our LGBT family especially LGBT children have meaning and impact. LGBT children hear these messages telling them they are nothing but second-class citizens and are left feeling broken or  less than. When children are dying because of negative messages, then it s time to change the message. Planting Peace calls for the immediate change in the Republican party platform with regard to our LGBT family and LGBT rights. Never again shall a negative, hateful message be uttered in the name of  religious freedom.  We are calling for action that brings full, fundamental rights to the LGBT community, and a narrative that empowers LGBT people to live and love freely.

Why in the world he would have such a ridiculous notion is unclear. Over and over we have seen black protesters assaulted at his rallies, often shouting such lovely sentiments as  light that motherf*cker on fire. Trump has made an appalling habit of retweeting white supremacists. White nationalists have made robocalls on his behalf in multiple states. At the same time, he has slammed the Black Lives Matter movement for being too  divisive. And these examples don t even include his bigoted rhetoric towards Mexicans and Muslims.He may deny it, but he knows he is in trouble when it comes to voters of color, that would be why he tweeted a fake photo of an African-American family who supposedly supported him.

After that, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus scuttled away into a private meeting with Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) and some of the #NeverTrump delegates. Also present was Colorado delegate and  Free the Delegates  leader  Kendal Unruh, who wants the RNC Rules Committee to unbind the delegates and allow them to vote against Trump, no matter what the voters in their state decided.There were surely clashes in this meeting, as fierce #NeverTrump types like Unruh were in that impromptu secret meeting with people such as Platform Committee member Jim Bopp, who vehemently opposes any and all efforts to stop Trump.

The illustration of just how chaotic it all has become is all in the excuse that was given to the press for the abrupt disruption of the Rules Committee session: a printer had jammed and they were making sure that got fixed first.

Hughley the night before.During the interview, Hughley sarcastically pointed out that Fox News does not cover racism fairly. The only place racism doesn t exist is Fox News and the police department,  Hughley said.  That s absolutely true. Megyn Kelly called Hughley s claim insulting to which he replied,  And I m insulted by the things I hear on this network, so we re even. I could care less about insulting people that insult me on a daily basis. Well, Fox News host Jedediah Bila disagreed with Hughley and told her View co-hosts that Fox is fair when it comes to covering racism. I ve hosted a bunch of shows there, we talk about issues of race all the time,  she claimed.  I mean, I m on with Juan Williams all the time. These are serious issues that we delve into. So, it felt like he was labeling the whole network as not willing to accept that racism is something that exists in this country. To recap, it appears Bila is using the ole  I m friends with a black person  defense to somehow claim that Fox fairly covers racism.Shen went on to excuse other Fox hosts  lack of coverage because she said they are exercising journalistic responsibility, which most objective people know is complete bullshit because Fox News doesn t give a damn about real journalism. When you have stories coming out where you have white on black crime, before we figure out what actually happened, a lot of people in media jump to conclusions or we surmise or we guess,  Bila continued.  And it shapes the narrative of how the public hears that. And it s really hard then when facts emerge to go back and say,  Oh, wait a minute, maybe in this particular case, this wasn t about racism. A stunned Whoopi Goldberg was quick to slap back. What shapes the narrative oftentimes is a disregard for the fact that we do have a racial issue, we do have an issue between how police are sometimes and how people of color are sometimes, and that s the discussion we don t have,  Goldberg said.And even conservative host Candace Cameron-Bure, who often appears on Fox News, agreed with Goldberg that Fox does not cover racism fairly. I watch Fox News, I m a Fox News supporter. But I agree with you. I don t feel like they are inclusive of all minority groups as much as they should be. Because conservatives aren t just white rich men or women. And Fox I don t feel always represents that point of view. I thought Megyn Kelly was great but I really appreciated everything that D.L. said as well. Here s the video via YouTube.Fox News has been especially unfair to Black Lives Matter in the wake of the Dallas shooting even though it is clear that the person who murdered those five police officers was not affiliated with the movement. Many Fox hosts have disregarded that fact and have continually demonized Black Lives Matter in a way that is inflaming racial tensions even further. Fox would not be doing that if they had even a shred of real journalistic responsibility.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

You know, the public lands that include National Forests and natural treasures like the Grand Canyon.In 2014, Cliven Bundy led an armed standoff against the federal government because he refused to pay grazing fees even though his cattle were grazing on federal property. And earlier this year, Bundy s sons Ammon and Ryan Bundy led an armed seizure of a federal wildlife reserve in Oregon that last for weeks until the FBI arrested them. All three Bundy s are now behind bars but the GOP is poised to adopt their wrongly held position that the federal government can t own land.In fact, Article 4, Section 3, Clause 2 of the Constitution specifically gives the federal government the power to own and regulate land.The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.But Republicans are proposing to turn over all public lands to the states so that they can sell them off to the highest bidders and strip the lands of all the resources. Congress should reconsider whether parts of the federal government s enormous landholdings and control of water in the West could be better used for ranching, mining or forestry through private ownership,  the draft says.  Timber is a renewable natural resource, which provides jobs to thousands of Americans. All efforts should be made to make federal lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service available for harvesting. The enduring truth is that people best protect what they own. But that is not true at all. These lands, such as the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area that was granted protection by Republican President Gerald Ford 40 years ago and the Noisy-Diobsud Wilderness Area that was granted protection by President Ronald Reagan, could be opened up to loggers if the new GOP has their way.These pristine lands and many others across the country haven t been touched, which means people are already protecting these public lands by keeping them public.Allowing these wilderness areas to fall into private ownership would mean Americans would lose access to these lands. Any private corporation that buys up this land will just put up signs that say  No Trespassing  and would proceed to cut down all the trees and strip mine the mountains and lands. Companies like Nestle could easily suck up all the water it wants. It would take generations for the forests to grow back and the area would never be the same. It would be devastated by private industry.That is why it is so important to vote in November. Republicans literally want to take our heritage away from us. They are bowing down to the demands of domestic terrorists. We can t let that happen if we want future generations to enjoy the natural wonders that past generations fought so hard to protect.Featured Image of Lake Tenaya in Yosemite National Park via Wikimedia""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Since Trump has zero experience in politics, the only thing he s been able to use as justification for why he is qualified to be President of the United States is his business record   which is actually horrendous when you look past the lies he spews. Still, even if he knows that several of his businesses have failed or were scammy operations, Trump does NOT like it when people point this out. So when Trump was questioned on Stern s show about a reporter who critiqued his business skills, Trump resorted to insults and disrespecting an entire demographic of people with disabilities.In the interview, co-host Robin Quivers addressed the criticism on Trump being shady and scammy in his business deals. Quivers said,  They are saying that then those guys don t get a return. You always make out but the guys don t get a return. Trump shot back: Okay, I know, and that makes me a bad person right?

But now, after U.S.-led bombing runs, drone strikes, and engagement on the ground by forces trained and armed by America and its allies, the caliphate is weakening.In public messages and in recent actions in Syria, the group s leaders are acknowledging the terrorist organization s declining fortunes on the battlefield while bracing for the possibility that its remaining strongholds could fall.While the death tolls are horrific and the loss of human life unacceptable, recent suicide bombings from those associated with ISIS are more evidence that it is losing in the territory it gained.At the same time, the group is vowing to press on with its recent campaign of violence, even if the terrorists themselves are driven underground. U.S. counterterrorism experts believe the mass- casualty attacks in Istanbul and Baghdad in the past month were largely a response to military reversals in Iraq and Syria.In 2014, under President Obama s orders, the United States launched Operation: Inherent Resolve.

If anyone can prove that point, it s renowned physicist, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, who in a Facebook post from Tuesday, described dozens of encounters he s had with police, for no reason other than his being African-American.In the post, Tyson told of a conference for black physicists he attended in 1991. One evening, after enjoying good food and wine, the discussion turned to the police. The physicists began relaying stories of being pulled over by the police.While most people probably have stories of being pulled over a handful of times in their lives, this table full of physicists had more than a handful of stories, and the intrusiveness of the stops was pretty telling.As for me, I had a dozen different encounters to draw from. There was the time I was stopped late at night at an underpass on an empty road in New Jersey for having changed lanes without signaling. The officer told me to get out of my car and questioned me for ten minutes around back with the bright head lights of his squad car illuminating my face. Is this your car? Yes. Who is the woman in the passenger seat? My wife. Where are you coming from? My parents house. Where are you going? Home. What do you do for a living? I am an astrophysicist at Princeton University. What s in your trunk? A spare tire, and a lot of other greasy junk. He went on to say that the  real reason  why he stopped me was because my car s license plates were much newer and shinier than the 17-year old Ford that I was driving. The officer was just making sure that neither the car nor the plates were stolen.In my other stories, I had been stopped by the police while transporting my home supply of physics textbooks into my newly assigned office in graduate school. They had stopped me at the entrance to the physics building where they asked accusatory questions about what I was doing. This one was complicated because a friend offered to drive me and my boxes to my office (I had not yet learned to drive). Her car was registered in her father s name. It was 11:30 PM. Open-topped boxes of graduate math and physics textbooks filled the trunk. And we were transporting them into the building. I wonder how often that scenario shows up in police training tapes. In total, I was stopped two or three times by other security officers while entering physics buildings, but was never stopped entering the campus gym.As a scientist, Tyson is cautious about jumping to conclusions. He noted that he and his colleagues had these police stops in common. Were police targeting physicists for some reason? Are smart people automatically suspicious? It couldn t have been the cars. Some were old, some were new. Some stops were during the day, some at night. The conclusion Tyson made, though is that:We were guilty not of DWI (Driving While Intoxicated), but of other violations none of us knew were on the books: DWB (Driving While Black), WWB (Walking While Black), and of course, JBB (Just Being Black).It s rare that Tyson jumps into politics, and he didn t specifically mention Black Lives Matter or any of the infamous black victims of police, but one can certainly infer by the timing of his post, that it s in solidarity with Black Lives Matter and it s further proof that all the education and poise in the world doesn t stop black people from being targeted. This is the very definition of white privilege.He s also right. Black people are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police and they re also more likely to be innocent of any wrongdoing during traffic stops. Fortunately, Tyson never had to go to jail, but black people are far more likely to be arrested, convicted, and yes, shot. If a group of scientists can conclude that there are racial disparities in the justice system, perhaps we should listen.Featured image via Dimitrios Kambouris with Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Like I said, I stop everybody,  Birch replies.  I m not targeting anybody. You just told me who the bad guys are,  his CO presses. Yeah, I know that. But there s also other people who are committing violations as well,  Birch says.  I m not saying that there s not violations being made. In other words, people from all demographics break the law. That should have been good enough for the commanding officer, but then the conversation went completely off the rails:CO: The male blacks, that you told me commit the crimes Birch: Plenty of people that I write summonses to are male blacks and male Hispanics.CO: You stopped two male blacks.Birch: Not for the whole year. You re telling me for the whole year I only stopped two male blacks on summonses?CO: 8/20. From January 1st to August 20th. Fifty-four TABs: two male blacks, seven Hispanics, seven other, ten white, three Asian. So where are you targeting the perps that you just told me?Birch: Like I said, if I don t see a perp jumping over the turnstile, what am I supposed to do to him?CO: These people are not going to pop.Birch: How do I know that? A female Hispanic that I stopped in Sheepshead Bay did pop, actually, for a warrant, and I arrested her. Female Hispanic. The Hispanics that we re supposed to be going after. That are committing the crimes. The people that I CO: Did you think that she was going to pop?Birch: Did I think she was going to pop? I didn t put no thought into it. If you come up for a collar, I m taking you in. Pop  is a term for when a warrant pops up and leads to an arrest. TAB is a term for a court summons resulting from a transit violation. The conversation continues, getting worse as it progresses:CO: Here s what I see. You just described to me who s committing the crimes. You re fully aware of it. But you re not targeting those people.Birch: I am. I m targeting everybody.CO: Two male blacks.Birch: Whoever is out there. If I CO: So you only saw two male blacks jump the turnstile?Birch: If you re saying that s what s in front of you, then yes, that s all I saw, is two male blacks for the whole year jumping the turnstile. If you re saying that s what s in front of you, I m not disputing that. If that s what I got there.CO: That is what you have. That is not disputed here.Birch: I m saying, we re also talking Hispanics as well. I stopped a lot of Hispanics, too.CO: Seven male Hispanics. But more than half are female.Birch: And like I said, everybody s committing violations in front of me. I was shocked,  Birch said of the meeting.  I was not only shocked, I was mad. My last name is Birch. I look white. They didn t realize I was a Puerto Rican kid, and they re just saying this to me like it s OK. It s OK, we re amongst friends. I don t want to be stopped because I m Puerto Rican,  he says.  I want to get stopped because I did something wrong. Birch is suing the department to combat  what he sees as a larger trend of policing that disproportionately affects minority New Yorkers,  Gawker reports. The targeting of minorities by the NYPD has caused so many problems throughout our city yet the NYPD continues to promote officers who engage in these activities,  his lawyer told the publication. It s very hard to have a job where the whole public is against you, including your bosses. And when you actually try to do something right, they don t care,  Birch says.  I can t wait to get away from this place. Birch is evidence that good cops do exist. The problem is that, unlike him, most good cops stay silent as bad actors disgrace the profession, unfairly targeting people who are not white. Thank you for stepping forward, Officer Birch. Hopefully, your example will lead other good cops to call out the bad ones.Hear the audio for yourself below:Featured image via YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Marcone said: It concerns me when the Republican leadership is supporting somebody who s blatantly racist and has said Islamophobic statements, wants to shut down our borders. Can you tell me, how can you morally justify your support for this kind of candidate, somebody who could be very destructive to our country? Ryan couldn t actually give Marcone a moral justification for why he continued to support Trump even though he d condemned several of the Islamophobic things Trump has said in the past. Basically accepting Marcone s description of Trump as a racist Islamophobic candidate, Ryan s only response was that carrying out the Republican party s agenda was more important to him than protecting America. Ryan fired back with notable irritation in his voice: That basically means you re going to help elect Hillary Clinton. And I don t think Hillary Clinton s going to support any of the things that you stand for, if you re a Republican.  So according to the Speaker of the House, subjecting America to a blatantly racist and Islamophobic idiot isn t as bad as having Clinton leading the country   even though she is far more qualified to do so and Ryan admitted that several of Trump s proposals were  wrong  and  don t reflect the view of fellow conservatives and Republicans.  Ryan said: She represents a third Obama term. I don t think that s good for America; I think that s the wrong direction. So, yes, things have been said that I, too, disagree with. Then I ll make that point, then, but I m going to go fight for the principles and these solutions that I believe in.

Gary Herbert cut off funding to Planned Parenthood, stripping vital financial support away from sexually transmitted disease and sex education programs.The head of the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah praised the ruling as a victory for the patients who depend on the services provided by the organization: Our doors are open today and they will be tomorrow   no matter what,  said CEO Karrie Galloway. A spokesman for the governor said he was disappointed by the ruling and believes that contract decisions should be left up to the state. Planned Parenthood s lawsuit challenging Herbert s defunding order will now go back to a lower court. The state has not decided what legal action they will take next, but one option would be to ask the full 10th Circuit to reconsider the panel s decision.Herbert had no comment on the finding by two appeals court judges that he most likely used the controversy as an opportunity to attack the group politically because they provide abortion services.Attorneys for the Utah branch of Planned parenthood argued that they have never participated in fetal donation programs. They also provided emails from state health officials expressing their concern that defunding the group would negatively impact the thousands of teenagers and low-income people who depend on the organization s services.Lawyers for the state argue that the governor legally has every right to right to end contracts and adds that Planned Parenthood was still embroiled in suspicion when Herbert issued his order blocking the organization s funding.Several states have tried to defund Planned Parenthood in the wake of the fake  baby parts  videos. In states such as Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, the organization has resorted to fighting these attempts to strip away their funding in court.Most states have sided with Planned Parenthood and ruled that the money must keep flowing, but U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups in Utah allowed Herbert to defund the group because he said the state has an interest in avoiding the perception of corruption. Waddoups conceded that the organization has not broken any laws, but said they had associated with other Planned Parenthood entities accused of  selling baby parts. Utah s branch of Planned Parenthood has an $8 million budget and the contracts blocked by Governor Herbert were worth $275,000.Planned Parenthood has been cleared of any wrongdoing in multiple investigations by congress and several states. The organization was also cleared by a Texas grand jury who chose to indict two of the makers of the heavily doctored videos instead.Featured image via The Hill""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I can t imagine what this place would be   I can t imagine what the country would be   with Donald Trump as our president,  Ginsburg told the New York Times in an interview published on Monday.And then she doubled down during an interview with CNN that same day. He is a faker. He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.   How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that. Indeed, the media has largely ignored Trump s refusal to release his tax returns unlike the way they hounded Mitt Romney four years ago.The Washington Post and the New York Times are both whining about Ginsburg s remarks. Both editorial boards are calling for her to stop  name-calling  and think she should stop talking all together.The hypocrisy here is stunning. Donald Trump has said far worse things on the campaign trail then Ginsburg has in these two interviews, but I don t recall seeing either editorial board telling the Republican nominee to shut his mouth. Furthermore, it s not exactly unprecedented for Supreme Court Justices to get involved in presidential politics. I seem to recall a certain 5-4 ruling the high court made in 2000 that handed George W. Bush the presidential election even though it was totally unprecedented for the Supreme Court to decide such a contest. The conservative judges ruled that Florida should not count the votes in a race that was incredibly close and could have gone either way if we had just allowed the democratic process to unfold. The Supreme Court should have stayed out of it then.Regardless, when Donald Trump heard that Ginsburg humiliated his sorry ass he exploded on Twitter. Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me,  he whined.  Her mind is shot   resign! Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot   resign!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2016Trump even complained to the New York Times, which happily gave Trump the platform to tell a woman to shut her mouth. I think it s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly. I think it s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn t believe it when I saw it. It s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible. Sorry, Donald. But Justice Ginsburg isn t retiring any time soon. In fact, she d probably make sure she stays put if you somehow become president just to spite you.The bottom line here is that Ruth Bader Ginsburg is not just a Supreme Court Justice, she s a citizen of this country with a right to free speech just like everyone else. This is a critical election at a momentous time in this country and Ginsburg clearly felt the need to speak up. It s hard to believe that if these remarks had come from one of her male colleagues that the Post and the Times would be throwing such a hissy fit over it. Trump is spewing unprecedented hate and vitriol in a presidential election, but these two newspapers are complaining about Ginsburg commenting about it.

Just when we all thought the brouhaha over Trump University was dying down, along come Patrick Caldwell and Mother Jones to throw a stinging dose of reality onto the whole sordid situation. It seems that one of the major things that Trump U. tried to teach was how to exploit poor, disabled people facing foreclosure.Gary Eldred, a real-estate investment advisor, explained in this particular course that seeking out short sales (situations in which the homeowner can t pay their mortgage back as it stands, and so a buyer convinces both them and their bank to settle for a lower price) that will be profitable requires looking for people who are  certified destitute.  That means people who are out of work and not likely to be working again anytime soon.Then Eldred goes on to identify ideal homeowner of whom to take advantage: The borrower is out of work, the borrower has $50,000 in unpaid medical claims, the borrower is completely disabled, the borrower has an extraordinarily messy divorce where everything has been squandered.  [emphasis mine]This could sound good at first   the investor is supposedly helping out someone who s otherwise stuck and facing financial ruin. However, short sales can result in thousands more in debt for the seller, depending the laws in their state. They can t sell their house for the balance of their mortgage, so everything they do get goes to the bank.It all goes to the bank. So there s the potential for a lot of profit for the investor at the expense of the homeowner because they may still owe their bank what s left on their mortgage, in addition to the thousands they owe elsewhere.Anybody who would take advantage of the disabled this way is a gold-digger engaged in cold-blooded fuckery. Nothing more.We shouldn t be surprised about this, though. The name of the course says it all:  Real Estate Goldmine: How To Get Rich Investing In Pre-Foreclosure Properties.  King Profiteer even started the  class  off with: We re not peddling get-rich-quick schemes, no blue-sky promises or an easy road to riches  The sad fact is, more and more property owners are getting themselves in trouble! Defaulting on mortgages and losing their homes or commercial properties. I m sorry for them, but life goes on, and the fact is, one person s misfortune is someone else s opportunity. That s just the way the world works. This program shows you how to make a lot of money from investing in pre-foreclosures. The Profit-Monger-in-Chief, however, has a long history of disregarding disabled people along with denying that he does so. However, like the fraud cases, he d likely say that he certainly didn t intend for this course to teach people how to exploit the disabled this way (he loves the disabled, nobody will be better for them than him), or he d deny that he even knew what was in this course.Considering that our wannabe President Dunce wants to reopen and oversee Trump U. after the suits are over (which he s sure will be dismissed, or that he ll win), this is actually a major bit of news, because he ll probably once again tell students to use the most vulnerable among us.

Abdullah Muflahi owns the Triple S Food Mart, where the events of that fateful night took place. Now, he has filed a lawsuit against the police. The suit alleges that in the aftermath of the murder of Alton Sterling, whom Muflahi allowed to sell his CD s out front of the store, Muflahi was taken into custody like a common criminal, where the cops took his cell phone, along with surveillance video of the shooting. All of this was done without a warrant, which is definitely illegal, and reeks of a cover-up. The suit says of what happened: At all times defendants knew that plaintiff Muflahi was only a witness to the events at his store and that being a witness did not entitle police to hold plaintiff in custody or seize or commandeer his store and store equipment. Of course, the cops are not talking about these new developments. Muflahi is suing the cops who shot Sterling, as well as the city of Baton Rouge itself. Also named in the lawsuit are the investigating officers and the Baton Rouge police chief. There was no warrant for any of the store s surveillance footage until roughly five hours after the cops murdered Alton Sterling, so they had no right to immediately take that footage, and at no point should Abdullah Muflahi been taken into custody for any reason. He was a witness to a crime committed by the Baton Rouge police. He is not the criminal here.The document that requested the warrant claimed that Sterling did not put his hands on the hood of a car when he was told to do so, and therefore tasers were used. They saw what they believed to be a gun sticking out of Sterling s pocket, and therefore they tased him. Now, anyone with knowledge of tasers knows that they incapacitate the average person pretty well. There was no need to shoot and kill him, but of course the cops claim otherwise: When the subject attempted to reach for the gun from his pocket, the officers fired their police-issued duty weapon at the subject to stop the threat. I d be willing to bet they erased what footage they could, along with any video on the cell phone they unlawfully took from Abdullah Muflahi.

Even Iowa s GOP governor opposes King s display of the Confederate flag because Iowa was a Union state during the Civil War.Indeed, 76,242 Iowa men fought against the Confederacy. Iowans fought bravely with distinction at the Battle of Wilson Creek in Missouri and many are buried at Vicksburg National Cemetery. King s support of the Confederate flag is an insult to their memory and the memory of the 13,000 Iowans who died trying to defeat the Confederacy. It s also disgraceful to the Iowans who were killed by Confederate bushwhackers who repeatedly raided the southern part of the state during the war.Iowa heavily backed Abraham Lincoln and the Union, so Steve King s display of an enemy flag is totally offensive, especially since he is supposed to be a United States congressman.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Why don t you go f*cking take pictures of your own f*cking street?  Gordon yells at Stone.Stone very politely informs an agitated Gordon that they are finishing up and will leave shortly, even going so far as to call Gordon  sir. Like many conservatives, Gordon has plastered the back of his vehicle with offensive bumper stickers, including one that says  No Hillary.  We know this because Gordon threw his SUV into reverse and angrily squalled his tires to turn the vehicle around so he could try to run Stone and his team down with it. Move your shit!  Gordon demands as Stone tries to reason with him unsuccessfully.Gordon literally tries to murder Stone with his SUV and Stone barely jumps out of the way in the nick of time. But Gordon refuses to stop. Gordon screams at Stone telling him that he s in his driveway and calls him a  dickhead. Stone says they will leave but Gordon makes that difficult because he is blocking their path, essentially refusing to let them leave as he demanded. He then gets out of his car with the intent of physically harming Stone. As soon as I slap the f*cking piss out of ya!  he says.Gordon then proceeds to break Stone s phone and refuses to pay for the damages by telling Stone to suck the price  out of my dick. Gordon has since been arrested by law enforcement and charged with assault with a deadly weapon, battery, and vandalism.Here s the video via YouTube.As you can see, the  driveway  Gordon is complaining about is just a public road. There does not appear to be an actual driveway off the side of it. It seems Gordon believes the entire road is his driveway. Perhaps he thought Stone was part of the mainstream media or something but that still does not excuse his threatening behavior. Stone was not the aggressor here and the police apparently agree.Gordon is just another angry middle aged white guy who thinks he can get away with bullying people and being a complete asshole toward others. Now he gets to think about his behavior in a jail cell.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

After being overshadowed by candidates like Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and the party s presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, Jeb has come to the surface to let everyone know that it wasn t his fault he lost.On Monday, the younger Bush reminded everyone that just like his big brother, he is also capable of spewing moronic garbage. In an interview with former Bush press secretary Nicolle Wallace, sore loser Jeb! made sure to remind Americans that the real reason he didn t win in South Carolina was because of the Pope.In discussing what went wrong in his presidential campaign that prevented him from surpassing the other candidates, Jeb said,  The Pope intervening in American politics didn t help. Wallace was shocked and pointed out You re Catholic, blaming the Pope! Bush reiterated that he wasn t blaming the Pope   but clearly Pope Francis  inconvenient mass had cost Jeb everything: No, no. I m not blaming. Talking about, basically, open borders at a time with the whole Trump phenomenon was to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. he goes to the border for a massive mass, and he had every right to preach the gospel there, I don t think he should be intervening, I don t think he understood he was intervening in our political affairs. That generated a lot of news and stopped the momentum. When Wallace asked Jeb to specify just how Pope Francis had helped the media kill his campaign, Jeb explained: The news cycle was dominated by that. Trump, to his credit, was very smart at exploiting these kind of opportunities. He s a master at understanding how the media works more than anybody I ve ever seen in politics, kudos for him for kind of creating the environment and then manipulating the environment to his effect. Jeb s comments are so ridiculous, they might as well have come from Ben Carson. Not only is Jeb criticizing the Pope, but he s praising Trump, who dissed the Catholic leader. Jeb is also in an insane amount of denial over the  three-way tie  for second place, because he seriously thinks that if the Pope hadn t ruined everything, he could have won. According to statistics, Trump, Rubio and Cruz all had over 22 percent of the vote each. Jeb lost South Carolina with 7.8 percent. But I m sure it was because of  the Pope.

What needs to be done and how it should be done are known by seasoned campaign operatives and candidates who put the people in place to make it happen.Donald Trump s presidential campaign, and the Republican Party s planning to help his campaign in multiple states that are key to winning, are a complete disaster with only four months to go until the election, according to a new report from the Associated Press.With early voting beginning in less than three months in some states, the review reveals that the national GOP has delivered only a fraction of the ground forces detailed in discussions with state leaders earlier in the year. And that is leaving anxious local officials waiting for reinforcements to keep pace with Democrat Hillary Clinton in the states that matter most in 2016.The Republican Party s massive failure gets even worse when you zoom in to swing states, as the Associated Press has:Some examples of Republican shortfalls: Ohio Republicans thought they were going to see 220 paid staffers by May; in reality there are about 50. Plans for Pennsylvania called for 190 paid staffers; there are about 60. Iowa s planned ground force of 66 by May actually numbers between 25 and 30. In Colorado, recent staff departures have left about two dozen employees, far short of the 80 that were to have been in place.AP even found that Trump s headquarters in Florida, one of the most important states in the fight for the electoral college, was closed and its voice mailbox full. Florida has 29 electoral votes and in 2012 was decided by a margin of 0.87 percent   on the ground organizing is key to winning it.These failures at the state organizing level don t even take into account the massive disparity in campaign advertising between Clinton and Trump. While she has been pumping out ads in important states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado, and New Mexico along with super PACs that support her, Trump hasn t been advertising at all. In 2012, Mitt Romney s campaign was outspent by President Obama, but he was actually spending money   Trump isn t spending on much, besides many of his own entities who showed up as campaign vendors.Republicans, especially in 2012, derided President Obama s background as a community organizer, but they could do with one right now to organize for their candidate in the communities he needs in order to have a chance at winning.

Turns out, this is BS and Brown just explained why.Brown was taking questions on Monday following a press conference discussing the vicious attack that left five police officers dead on Thursday.

We know that there was at least one gentleman who was a subject   person of interest, during the demonstration he had an AR-15 around his   around his shoulder,  he was asked.  What does this tell you about people using the new Texas law of open carry at a demonstration like this? After finding out that the person asking the question was indeed local, Brown explained the position law enforcement finds themselves in as a result of open carry laws put in place by lawmakers who are in the pocket of the NRA. In the process, he completely laid waste to the myth of a  good guy with a gun  saving the day. All right, so, it s a little different here in Texas in the way we view open carry, concealed carry. We ve had great dialogue with our state legislators about this. We ve expressed all of our concerns. We are trying as best as we can as a law enforcement community to make it work so the citizens can express their Second Amendment rights.But it s increasingly challenging when people have AR-15s slung over and shootings occur in a crowd and they begin running, and we don t know   or we don t know if they re the shooter or not, or they begin, it s been the presumption that a good guy with a gun is the best way to resolve some of these things. Well, we don t know who the good guy is versus who the bad guy is if everybody starts shooting, and we ve expressed that concern as well. Brown concluded by saying that he hopes lawmakers will listen to input from law enforcement when in comes to gun laws. I have every belief and trust that our folks are listening at the state on this issue, particularly as it involves protests,  said the chief.He also noted that time after time, congress offers  thoughts and prayers  when mass shootings take place, yet they do nothing to take any meaningful steps towards preventing tragedies like this from occurring.

They re not protesters. You know, these are thugs, they re rioters. And yeah, I m calling out the media, saying quit claiming that these rioters are people. They re stomping on a flag   figuratively and literally   shouting  death to cops , celebrating violence. Black Lives Matter is a non-violent peaceful movement protesting police brutality and the unjust killing of innocent black people by police officers who flagrantly use excessive force.Furthermore, the Black Lives Matter rally in Dallas was a peaceful march and leaders worked with police prior to and during the demonstration. And when shots were fired protesters helped police identify where the shots were coming from.It should also be pointed out that burning an American flag is not illegal and is considered protected by free speech.But none of the facts matter to America s village idiot.She went on to call black people who speak out against police violence  evil  and attempted to co-opt Dr. Martin Luther King, who also led nonviolent demonstrations in the 1960s to fight for civil rights the same way Black Lives Matter does today. I think the media is perpetuating a message that really evil people are thriving on right now as they try to warp malleable minds that would believe that one race matters more than another. You know, it s the antithesis of Martin Luther King Jr. s message. It s the antithesis of our Constitution, of the Bill of Rights, our charters of liberty that says all men are created equal.

A right-wing gun nut could have killed dozens of people had he not lost his nerve after pulling his gun and aiming it at the protesters marching down the street.So rhetoric like Palin s is only making things worse.

Hill, who is a Morehouse College professor, spoke about the systemic racism that black communities have been facing, while Houck was more interested in defending law enforcement and came out with statistics about black crime in New York City to prove his point.

Huock rattled off the following stats: In New York City alone, blacks are 23% [of the population]; they make up 75% of all shootings, 70% of all robberies, 60% of all violent crimes. White only 3%. That is why there are more blacks in jail than there are whites. Hill fired back, denouncing that those numbers were the result of  a system that s dysfunctional .

She s also one of the many delegates working their asses off to alienate everyone who isn t Christian and straight by condemning every form of relationship that isn t male-female.She and the Christian group, Concerned Women for America, believe that the widespread availability and use of adult material is just too addicting for young people, and therefore, it s up to the state governments to curb it: It s such an insidious epidemic and there are no rules for our children,  Forrester said.

He s even conning people with his fake knowledge of the Constitution and his fake Christianity.If you re still not sure about that last one (after all, he is the favorite for Evangelicals), it s been uncovered that his  spiritual advisor  is herself a con artist who scams people out of $1,144 each in a Harry Potter inspired scam.Trump credits Pastor Paula White with his conversion to Christianity. The two have a lot in common. White is an attractive blonde (likely just his type) and at 50, she, like Trump, has been married three times. She s known Trump for a long time and has claimed that his conversion came long before Trump began his run for office. I can absolutely tell you that Mr. Trump has a relationship with God. He is a Christian, he accepts Jesus as his Lord and savior,  White said in a rare interview with POLITICO, reflecting on a relationship with the New York tycoon that has now spanned more than 14 years.She won t elaborate, though, on the exact moment Trump decided to accept Jesus as his Lord and savior. One thing that might attract him to her brand of Christianity is her belief that God wants people to be wealthy. She happily flaunts her wealth, even if much of it is ill gotten. She s in trouble with the IRS, she has business troubles and she s common tabloid fodder.White, an author and TV personality who at one time had  millions in the bank,  has had financial challenges of her own. In the early 2000s, the ministry s spending habits drew scrutiny first from the IRS, and then from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who launched a congressional probe. The probe was eventually dropped (her ministry didn t fully respond to congressional inquiries, according to reports at the time). The Tampa-based church that she and her ex-husband founded and led   which began to fall apart after their 2007 divorce   declared bankruptcy in 2014, though by then she was leading another church, in Orlando.One specific scam, though, came straight from the Harry Potter novels. For the low, low price of $1,144, White will sell her rubes a  resurrection seed,  much like Harry Potter s  resurrection stone.  The resurrection seed promises to resurrect the dead. The $1,144 figure came from John 11:44, which says,  I believe for resurrection life. Preaching the story of Lazarus who Jesus resurrected from the dead in John 11:38-44, White promised believers in a video appeal that if they would sow the seed and have faith, she believed deliverance would come. I don t know what is dead. I don t know what the enemy sent a death to. I don t know what decision that caused death to come upon whatever the situation you re facing, but I do know that God has sent me to you to bring resurrection life. To tell you that I believe that as we put our faith together before Easter Sunday on March 27, there s gonna be resurrection life in your life,  said White. The grave clothes are coming off,  she continued.  Whatever residue of death. Whatever residue is holding you back, it is coming off.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) recently pointed out something that conservatives had hoped would go unnoticed: Open Carry, the movement that allows Texans the right to carry AR-15s nearly anywhere in public, didn t help during the police ambush, and actually made everything much, much worse. Rawlings said Dallas police Chief David Brown told him that people running through the shooting scene with rifles and body armor required officers to track them down and bring them to the police department.  Whether that was time that could have been spent trying to find and stop the shooter is something police will have to comment on. Major Max Geron of the Dallas PD didn t mind answering that question:  There was also the challenge of sorting out witnesses from potential suspects. Texas is an open carry state, and there were a number of armed demonstrators taking part. There was confusion on the radio about the description of the suspects and whether or not one or more was in custody. Dallas police have every right to feel frustrated and sickened by the response from both their state Republican Party and the ones in Washington, D.C. Law enforcement agencies have repeatedly warned pro-gun lawmakers that these fanatical pushes to put guns in every citizen s hands and in every corner of public life means putting both civilians and cops at risk. It makes policing harder. It makes mass murder easier. And it makes the lines between  good guy with a gun  and  bad guy with a gun  impossible to separate.To be clear, Democrats need to bear some responsibility for inaction as well. After massacres at Sandy Hook and Aurora, there was motivation from Americans to finally fix this problem   and Democrats let it slip through their fingers. Following Orlando, progressive lawmakers seemed to show signs that enough was enough, but they need to keep at it.The way forward is simple: Congress needs to put the lives of American citizens above the  rights  of an AR-15.

He does not appear to be waving a gun or behaving erratically.At the 27-second mark, the first police car arrives on the scene. According to police they were just driving by and saw Braziel waving a gun around in the street.

The video also casts doubt on this statement.One unidentified witness to the shooting, who posted this video to YouTube, states that Braziel didn t do nothing. She states: They just rolled up on him. They said the man was shooting in the air and the police just came up and started shooting. They just shot at somebody, whoever was walking, they just shot him.

He was standing just about 20 to 25 yards away from Strickland when he went all Second Amendment on the protestestors, sweeping the crowd with his firearm.After the arrest, police found an extended clip in Strickland s handgun, a round in the chamber of the gun, plus two magazines of ammunition in a belt pouch, two magazines in one of his pants pockets and one magazine in the other, Molina said.

He s actually pointing out a fact there is systemic racism in this country and there are police departments that need to be reformed. Walsh then went on to say that most Americans   himself excluded of course   are just simply too dumb to understand what President Obama has said regarding his public statements on systemic racism in the criminal justice system. When he said there s systemic racism in the police department after the Minneapolis shooting, he s telling people on the streets that police officers are racist. Now, maybe you and I can make that distinction, but when people on the street hear the President of the United States time after time say that there is racism in police departments all over the country, man, that kind of hating leads to what you got in Dallas. Yeah, because  This is now war, Real America is coming after you,  is such a loving statement to make. Maybe if has-been Tea Party politicians such as Walsh didn t say things like  Obama has done nothing but hate on cops  repeatedly on social media and on television, then those  average people  might not be so quick to jump to the conclusion that President Obama hates police officers. You would think that a self-identifying above average person like Walsh would understand that.You can watch the segment below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmENSX7lQigFeatured image from video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

We are taught to embrace humility and diversity. We can understand why, in seeking America s highest office, you have used your degree from Wharton to promote and lend legitimacy to your candidacy.As a candidate for President, and now as the presumptive GOP nominee, you have been afforded a transformative opportunity to be a leader on national and international stages and to make the Wharton community even prouder of our school and values.However, we have been deeply disappointed in your candidacy.We, proud students, alumni, and faculty of Wharton, are outraged that an affiliation with our school is being used to legitimize prejudice and intolerance. Although we do not aim to make any political endorsements with this letter, we do express our unequivocal stance against the xenophobia, sexism, racism, and other forms of bigotry that you have actively and implicitly endorsed in your campaign. The Wharton community is a diverse community. We are immigrants and children of immigrants, people of color, Muslims, Jews, women, people living with or caring for those with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ community. In other words, we represent the groups that you have repeatedly denigrated, as well as their steadfast friends, family, and allies.We recognize that we are fortunate to be educated at Wharton, and we are committed to using our opportunity to make America and the world a better place for everyone. We are dedicated to promoting inclusion not only because diversity and tolerance have been repeatedly proven to be valuable assets to any organization s performance, but also because we believe in mutual respect and human dignity as deeply held values. Your insistence on exclusion and scapegoating would be bad for business and bad for the American economy. An intolerant America is a less productive, less innovative, and less competitive America.We, the undersigned Wharton students, alumni, and faculty, unequivocally reject the use of your education at Wharton as a platform for promoting prejudice and intolerance. Your discriminatory statements are incompatible with the values that we are taught and we teach at Wharton, and we express our unwavering commitment to an open and inclusive American society.In addition, the authors of the letter spoke to NBC about their decision to write it. It was important for us to speak out against Trump because, as we have seen in many moments throughout history, silence is an act of complicity. This open letter speaks on behalf of Wharton students, alumni and faculty who wish to speak out against hate and stand in solidarity with all members of our diverse community   both at Wharton and across America. In short, Donald Trump just received a giant middle finger from the school and it s a safe bet that past faculty regret that he was ever allowed to step foot in their classrooms. Because every time Trump opens his mouth he makes it hard to believe that he could have ever actually earned a degree anywhere in the first place.Featured Image: Mark Lyons/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

According to Carey, nearly every student report was forwarded to the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency.Between the time the school adopted the new policy and the end of the school year, about a month later, police had been called on Kindergartners for arguing, second-graders for calling each other names like  fat  and  short,  a game of tag that was  too rough,  and much more.Police were called on an elementary school student who reportedly made a  gun noise,  and  held his ukulele like a gun.  Another elementary school student was reported to police for calling another student  cheater,  during gym class.Police were called over a picture drawn by a student at Tatem Elementary School. The student reportedly drew a zombie holding a gun.Two second-graders were also reported to police for  roughhousing  on their way to lunch.The list of minor infractions goes on and on. Philly.com reports that many of the incidents were not even witnessed by teachers, but were made in response to complaints from other students.A parent called the school to express concerns about a game of tag that she thought was getting  too rough.  The parent later said she just wanted the school to keep a better eye on the kids during recess. The school reported the call to police.The Inquirer obtained police reports for at least 22 police visits to Collingswood Schools during a one month time period. Links to reports made by each of the district s six schools can also be found here.The school district, police and prosecutor s office all worked together to create the new policy. Parents were not informed of the change to school policy until June 27, ten days after the school year ended. In all cases, the students were interviewed by police without a parent or guardian present.It seems that local officials were hoping to get an early start on the school-to-prison pipeline.Outraged parents demanded that the school get rid of the new policy. According to Philly.com, the school system will return to the former policy of reporting students to the police only if weapons, drugs, or sexual misconduct are involved.Image credit: Collingswood Police Department via Facebook""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The differences can be seen through all aspects of life, but the most stark is the fact that white people are much, much more likely to die of old age than are black people. In fact, data guru Nate Silver says that to be black in America is just about as bad as living in war torn Rwanda.Gun arguments aside if you re white in America, you re pretty damned safe. Your chance of being murdered in any given year is 2.5 out of 10,000. That s about equal to Finland, Israel and Chile. To be black, though, is very different. Your odds of being murdered about about eight times higher, or 19.4 out of every 10,000. That compares to Myanmar, Rwanda, Mexico, Brazil and Nigeria.Silver rarely expresses his political opinions (other than statistical predictions) but he did editorialize a bit on police brutality: So I m an editor now as well as a writer so we think when a story occurs is this a quote unquote  random act of violence  or is this representative of some broader trend and I think these stories about police brutality, it s uncovering things that have been going on for a long time and that are very common experiences Now that we do have video cameras everywhere it s not a coincidence that all of a sudden now that we have means to record these things all of a sudden these things crop up all the time.

When some white kid walks into a church and shoots a bunch of worshipers who invite him to worship with them we don t assume somehow he s making a political statement that s relevant to the attitudes of the rest of America. And we shouldn t make those assumptions about a troubled Muslim individual who is acting on their own in that same way. President Obama then moved on to speak about guns and the role they play in these tragedies. I am going to keep talking about the fact that we cannot eliminate all racial tension in our country overnight. We are not going to be able to identify ahead of time and eliminate every madman or troubled individual who might want to do harm against innocent people. But we can make it harder for them to do so. President Obama mentioned the harrowing number of gun violence incidents that have occurred in this country for the last ten years, pointing out that there is a  pattern  of gun violence that makes America  unique in the scale of violence that we experience  including mass shootings and gun murders we mostly consider  routine.  President Obama mentioned his hometown of Chicago as an example.President Obama then made a connection between all of these shootings and the lack of gun restrictions that make it harder for people officers to do their jobs. Part of what s creating tensions between communities and the police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere,  he said before using Dallas as an example because protesters participating in the rally that night exercised their right to open carry because Texas is an open-carry state. Because of all the guns around, the confused police initially had trouble figuring out who was shooting at them, even aiming their guns at the crowd before discovering where the shots were really coming from.With that said, President Obama challenged Republicans to put their money where their mouth is and treat guns as a contributing factor to gun violence if they really care about the lives of police as they claim: If you care about the safety of our police officers, then you can t set aside the gun issue and pretend that s irrelevant We can t just ignore that and pretend that that s somehow political or the president is just pushing his policy agenda. It s a contributing factor, not the sole factor, but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve There is a way to talk about that that is consistent with our Constitution and the Second Amendment. The problem is even mention of it somehow evokes this kind of polarization between a very intense minority and a majority of Americans who think we could do better when it comes to gun safety. Here s the video via Youtube.Conservatives want everyone to believe that there is a war between cops and black people, probably because they are hoping for one so the NRA and gun industry can make more money selling guns to every person they successfully scare with their bullshit. But the fact is that if the Dallas shooter had not had access to a high-powered assault rifle, there would be more police officers alive today. But Republicans refuse to do anything that would tighten gun restrictions in this country even though such restrictions could reduce gun violence and save lives, including the lives of police officers who have to work in these guns everywhere states wondering who is going to open fire next.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Ailes is currently the subject of a lawsuit from former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson, who alleges that he demoted her after she rebuffed a sexual advance and complained about a sexist work environment.New York magazine is reporting on the new allegations, in which two women have gone on the record while the remaining four are making their claims anonymously at the moment.Kelli Boyle, a former field adviser for the Republican National Committee, says that she went to dinner with Ailes in 1989 when he then propositioned her: He had a driver and a car, and after dinner he said,  Can I take you to your friend s?  So we get in the car and that s when he said,  You know if you want to play with the big boys, you have to lay with the big boys.  I was so taken aback. I said,  Gosh I didn t know that. How would that work?  I was trying to kill time because I didn t know if he was going to attack me. I was just talking until I could get out of the car. He said,  That s the way it works,  and he started naming other women he s had. He said that s how all these men in media and politics work   everyone s got their friend. Boyle then says Ailes told her she would have to give oral sex  every once in a while.  She then found herself frozen out of a job offer and says Ailes told her that her refusal to accept advances had a role in being turned down. Boyle also says that a friend  high up  in the Republican Party said,  Word went out you weren t to be hired. Marsha Callahan, a former model, said she had an encounter with Ailes when he was producing The Mike Douglas Show. Callahan alleges that when she went to his office Ailes told her,  Sit on the sofa and lift your skirt up  and that  he d put me on the show but I needed to go to bed with him. A model going by the pseudonym Susan said Ailes met with her in his office when she was sixteen years old on the same show and  proceeded to pull down his pants and very gingerly pull out his genitals and said,  Kiss them. Jane,  a model, said in 1984 that in an interview Ailes  pulled out a garter belt and stockings and told me to put them on  and  After that, something sexual took place, but I blocked it out of my mind. I don t know if I engaged with him orally or he engaged with himself. I felt I was being used for his sexual satisfaction. Diane,  a media consultant, said Ailes  grabbed me and had his hands on me and he forced me to kiss him. When I recoiled he said,  Well, you know no girls get a job here unless they re cooperative. Pat,  a former TV producer said she had an interview with Ailes at his apartment at Central Park South. She claims,  I don t remember his exact words, but his message was: If you want to make it in New York City in the TV business, you re going to have to fuck me, and you re going to do that with anyone I tell you to. Ailes denies the allegations from Carlson and his lawyers filed a motion on Friday that would take testimony and findings related to Carlson s allegations out of the public eye.Fox s parent company, Rupert Murdoch s 21st Century Fox, said they were conducting and internal review of the allegations against Ailes.Featured images via YouTube/YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Many conservatives have responded to the Dallas attacks by denouncing the Black Lives Matter movement, and the former vice presidential candidate just couldn t be left out.In a vile, racist Facebook post, Palin put in her two cents and told everyone just how furious she is while stating that  Black Lives Matter is a farce.  She wrote: # BlackLivesMatter  is a farce and hyphenating America destroys us.

Yes   Palin has just accused minorities of being racist when she said that those who hyphenate racial backgrounds (such as African-Americans or Mexican-Americans) are actually the ones who  further divide our nation.

Palin also accused the media of having blood on its hands for (accurately) depicting Black Lives Matter as a peaceful movement: Media: quit claiming the rioters are  peaceful  as they stomp on our flag, shout  death to cops!  and celebrate violence. It is sick. You perpetuate a perverted message evil men thrive on to intimidate and warp malleable minds that would believe one race matters more than another.

Amid their messages of mourning and healing as a nation, members also demanded that congress finally hold a vote on several pieces of legislation that focus on tightening gun restrictions.Representative G.K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina and the chairman of the caucus, said that in the wake of the  despicable crimes  in Dallas, the Caucus was determined to continue  our fight to remove guns from the hands of terrorists and would-be criminals. We come to this place each week to represent our constituents who are in pain. As of June 30, just a few days ago, 491 Americans have been fatally shot by the police; most of those were African-American.Last night, despicable crimes were committed against Dallas police officers, and when the dust settled five of them were dead as a result of an organized execution by criminals who possess guns and use them to the extreme. And so the Congressional Black Caucus convenes today to say to America we are continuing our fight to remove guns from the hands of terrorists and would-be criminals.Democrats have been fighting for several pieces of legislation. These measures include an effort bolster mandatory background checks and  No Fly No Buy,  which would stop suspected terrorists on no-fly lists from being able to legally purchase guns. Republicans have staunchly refused to take any action on the measures.Republicans, what on Earth are you, why are you recoiling and not giving us a debate on gun violence?  Mr. Butterfield said.  Why are you recoiling and not giving us a debate on gun violence? Why not give it a hearing, give us a debate, give us an up-or-down vote on our legislation on gun violence? Why?Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, led last month s sit-in on the House floor over gun control legislation following the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando. He urged protesters to remain peaceful, preaching the non-violent ways of the Civil Rights movement, in which he was an influential leader.There s no room in our society for violence; we respect law enforcement. There needs to be greater training of law enforcement and sometimes I feel that maybe not only those of us that engage in nonviolent protest but police officers need to be taught the way of peace, the way of love, the way of nonviolence, to respect the dignity and the worth of every human being.It doesn t matter whether black or white, Latino, Asian-American or Native American; we are one family living in one house. We must learn to live together as brothers and sisters. If not, we will perish as fools. We have too many guns. There has been too much violence. And we must act.Watch the Black Caucus demand congress hold a vote on gun control legislation here:Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In June, that number went up to over 3,500. Now, he s up to more than 4,000 and many are as frivolous as you might imagine.Trump is an argument for why rich people should pay more in taxes. Every single lawsuit that Trump engages in to protect his business costs taxpayers money and he spends a hell of a lot of taxpayer money in the courts. He uses them to renegotiate his bills, to defend his refusal to pay taxes, to iron out personal beefs (and we all know how he racks those up) and whatever floats his litigious boat on any given day.Here s a breakdown:The bulk of the cases involve his casinos. There are 1,863 casino cases and overwhelmingly, Trump is the one suing.There are 79 cases involving branding or trademark disputes.There are 206 contract dispute cases and in more than 2/3 of them, Trump is being sued.There are also 130 employment cases, and in the vast majority, he s being sued.61 of them are related to his golf resorts.191 of them are either Trump suing the government or the government suing him.There are six cases involving his presidential campaign, including a class action suit over bulk text messages directed toward people who never signed up.Surprisingly, there are only 12 defamation cases, despite the fact that he constantly threatens to sue.He s a defendant in 694 personal injury cases and a plaintiff in one.There are 621 real estate lawsuits, where he is generally the defendant.Yes, Hillary Clinton is also involved in several lawsuits (about 900), but overwhelmingly, she is being sued by federal prisoners, political activists and other people looking to sue the government. It s not because she s Hillary Clinton, per se, it s because she was a high ranking member of the government.Trump, though, should not get anywhere near the White House. We cannot have him nominating judges. We already know how that could turn out.

She also said that white people should start listening to legitimate cries  of the black community.

Castile did everything right   he informed the officer he was licensed, he was carrying, and then told him he was reaching for his wallet as ordered, and he was murdered anyway. One might say he was murdered for daring to carry while black.As  the nation s largest and oldest civil rights organization  (oh, please), the NRA remained suspiciously silent for two days following Castile s murder, likely because they know how this makes them look, and it ain t good. Today, they finally broke their silence, obviously figuring out a way to comment on Castile s murder without actually giving validity to the Black Lives Matter movement and their many justified grievances:Investigation? Really? Do they want a thorough investigation into the deaths of the Dallas police officers before actually commenting there, too? No, of course not. The deaths of those officers feed their narrative and makes them look like allies of the police, which bolsters the racist beliefs of their primary base. The death of a black man exercising his 2nd Amendment right? Well, that should just be swept under the rug lest we continue to fuel racial tensions.Here s what they said about the tragedy in Dallas. Judge for yourself:They were very quick to issue a statement following the shooting of 12 police officers in Dallas. The NRA caters to  white identity  politics, and they love to whine about BLM s criticism of police. Thus, it s easy for them to talk about police officers being shot, and white people being shot, as though black people are the scourge of our society.But when it s a black person that s been shot because they dared to exercise their 2nd Amendment right to carry?Silence.Until they figure out exactly how to craft a response that still caters to  white identity  politics while pretending they aren t also implying that black people don t have a 2nd Amendment right to carry a gun.Racial resentment (read: white pride) is one of the main drivers of opposition to every form of gun legislation ever. The two are intimately linked, and the NRA fuels it because it ensures more gun sales. The more racist a white person is, the harder the NRA works to court them.Their statement is a non-statement, and it s shameful and disgusting, both in its tardiness and in what it says.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

A black protester even suffered a gunshot wound to the leg when she threw herself on top of her kids to protest them.

While it is a crime for you to lie to police, attorney Chris Burney writes in a blog post discussing myths related to criminal law:Cops are allowed to lie about anything.Let s repeat that: The police are allowed to lie to you  about anything.The most common example of this is police interrogation.  The cops are allowed to use any deception they like, in order to get a confession.For example, they can tell you your partner s being interrogated upstairs, and just confessed, so you d better come clean if you know what s good for you (when they haven t even arrested your partner yet.)  They can say the victim told them you did it before she died (when she s actually still alive, and never said anything of the sort).The biggest lie (and one that works all the time) is that this conversation is strictly off the record.   Just between you and me.  Nothing you ever say to a police officer is ever off the record.  If it can be used against you, it will.The second-biggest lie (also one that works all the time) is that, if you come clean, the officer will make sure you get treated leniently.  He ll make sure the DA gives you a lighter charge.  He ll put in a word with the judge to make sure you get off with a lighter sentence.  He ll only arrest you for the misdemeanor.  Complete horseshit, of course   that cop s going to make sure you go down for whatever it is you just confessed to   but it works all the time.  People cut their losses, seeing themselves in a hopeless situation, and grasp at the opportunity to at least minimize the bad.Oh, and if you think innocent people don t do that too, then you ve got another think coming.  Innocent people do confess to crimes they didn t commit, for a variety of reasons.  (That s a subject for a whole nother myth.)  And lying cops is one of the big ones.And the cops are completely within their rights to lie this way.  Unlike prosecutors and judges, who have professional ethics to comply with, the police are allowed to use whatever lawful tools they have in order to solve a crime.  It s not against the law for them to lie.  They re allowed to.And so they will.  They re trained to do it.  They re supposed to do it.  They re gonna do it.In this case, police were hoping to wrap things up quickly with a confession from an innocent man.

After shouting and trying to rouse the guard, however, the group of men in the cell realized something was very wrong.Kelton says they attempted to call for help, but no one outside of the locked room heard their shouts. In desperation, the eight prisoners forced open the door of their cell.Kelton told KUSA that when they reached the guard he did not have a pulse.

Any guess what happened next? Just as expected, right-wingers totally lost their damn minds.The president said he was  horrified  by the  vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement.  After expressing his support for law enforcement, Obama turned his attention to the guns that allow mass shootings like this to take the so many lives in mere minutes.We also know that when people are armed with powerful weapons, unfortunately it makes attacks like these more deadly and more tragic. And in the days ahead, we re going to have to consider those realities as well.Predictably, Republicans went into full-on freak out mode. Within an hour of President Obama s remarks, Ben Carson was throwing a hissy fit on Fox News. Now is definitely not the time to get political,  said the failed presidential hopeful turned Trump fanboy.  Now is the time to use logic and ask ourselves, why do we have a Constitution? Why do we have a Second Amendment? They re always saying you don t need a high-powered weapon to hunt deer. The Constitution is not about deer hunting. It s about people being able to defend themselves from an overly aggressive government or an external invasion. Carson said that if he were president, he would ask everyone to  imagine 24 or 48 hours with no police. What would your life be like? Yes, there are some bad apples and, yes, we will find ways to deal with them but in no way do we indict the entire police force,  Carson said.Speaking of the tragic shooting in Dallas that took the lives of five police officers and left six more wounded, Carson said that there are terror cells  and  professional agitators all over our country looking for opportunities. And these opportunities do arise. They will continue to arise because, you know, there are bad apples in the police force like there are bad apples in everything. There are bad surgeons,  the retired neurosurgeon said.  But the vast majority of surgeons are wonderful people. So, you know, these opportunities will continue to happen and they will continue to do these things. But I guess the real issue is, you know, the president s going to start saying, see, gun control. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee took the opportunity to pounce on the president s comments as well, arguing on Fox News that Obama should have addressed the nation more like Ronald Reagan did after the 1986 Challenger disaster. He doesn t need to inject the divisive arguments like gun control at a time of great grief for the nation. And he ought to do for us what Ronald Reagan did after the Challenger disaster,  Huckabee said.Colorado Republican Senate candidate Darryl Glenn just had to jump on the bandwagon, saying that Obama needs  to be very careful not to get too far ahead of the facts, but you need to be careful not to drive your policy agenda. William Johnson, the executive director of National Association of Police Organizations, was asked on Fox News if police officers feel increasingly under siege and targeted. Absolutely. It s a horrible day. It s a war on cops,  Johnson responded.  And the Obama administration is the Neville Chamberlain of this war. I think their continued appeasement at the federal level with the Department of Justice, their appeasement of violent criminals, their refusal to condemn movements like Black Lives Matter, actively calling for the death of police officers, that type of thing, all the while blaming police for the problems in this country has led directly to the climate that has made Dallas possible. Speaking about the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile just hours before Thursday s mass shooting in Dallas, President Obama had tried to strike a balance between the public outrage over the police killings and support for law enforcement. To be concerned about these issues is not to be against law enforcement,  he said.  When people say black lives matter, it doesn t mean blue lives don t matter.

In fact, it seems like police will go above and beyond the call of duty and display extraordinary patience to make sure a white person is taken alive even if they are killing people and threatening the lives of others, including the police themselves. That kind of patience is not even remotely shown towards an unarmed black person when police show up. They re just shot and killed for no reason and that is precisely why there are protests in our streets, and sadly, why five Dallas police officers are dead this morning. Those officers should not be dead. And all the unarmed black people who have been unjustly murdered by police should not be dead either. All of this could have been prevented had police simply treated black people the same way they treat white people. Just doing that alone would mean more people would be alive today.Featured Image: Screenshot ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He threatened three of them with making sure none are reelected.Trump is famously very thin-skinned. Whenever he feels he s been wronged, which is basically all the time, or whenever someone fails to fawn all over him, he retaliates. He often takes to social media for retaliation, or the campaign trail, but this time, he s threatening more and today s biggest victim if Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona).Flake isn t shy about saying that he thinks Trump would be very bad for the country. When he (Trump) refers to a judge born in Indiana as a Mexican in a pejorative way, when he calls those crossing the border rapists or when he goes after McCain (who Trump accused of being a coward because he was captured and held prisoner during the Vietnam War), somebody has to stand up and say,  This is not the Republican Party,    Flake added.  Because we ll have elections beyond this one, too, and we can t associate ourselves with those kinds of comments and be a serious national party. Source: Arizona CentralTrump responded by calling Flake  very critical of me. Flake, defending McCain, said,  yes, I m the other senator from Arizona   the one who didn t get captured   and I want to talk to you about statements like that.  Flake also insisted that he will not get behind Trump as a candidate. Trump then said that Flake will lose his election. Perhaps Trump should have uncharacteristically done his homework. Flake isn t running for reelection for two more years.The other victims of the unity meeting were Senator Mark Kirk (R-Illinois), who withdrew his endorsement of Trump and Senator Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska), who is advocating for a third-party candidate.Characterizing Kirk as a loser, Trump vowed that he would carry Illinois in the general election even though the state traditionally has been solidly Democratic in presidential contests. Kirk did not attend the meeting with Trump.Source: Washington PostTrump was more cordial to Sasse, who is still not on the billionaire s side. Senator Sasse went to today s meeting ready to listen. Senator Sasse introduced himself to Mr. Trump, and the two had a gracious exchange,  said James Wegmann, the senator s spokesman.  Mr. Sasse continues to believe that our country is in a bad place and, with these two candidates, this election remains a dumpster fire. Nothing has changed. Still, Republicans are by and large falling in line with the candidate. He was greeted by applause in the House, but that doesn t mean everyone is with him. Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pennsylvania), says he still needs to be persuaded, so the door is still open.Rep. Mark Sanford (R-South Carolina), who s most famous for skipping out on his job and lying to his constituents while he had a tryst with his Argentinian girlfriend, had concerns that Trump didn t know enough about the Constitution. Some were concerned that Trump has praised Saddam Hussein. Others complained of the infamous Star of David tweet that Trump insists was a  sheriff s star.

The murders of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and of Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, have once again reminded us that there is an unequal system of justice in America. If you re white, you re arrested and charged. If you re not, something as simple as jaywalking can be a death sentence.Video of the Sterling shooting shows officer pinning the 37-year-old man to the ground before he was shot multiple times in the back and chest. As for Castile, well, we saw him die live on Facebook after his girlfriend turned on her camera following the shooting. They had been pulled over for a  busted tail light,  and the 32-year-old was shot as he was reaching for his ID and wallet as police requested. Castile had a gun on him   he licensed to carry a concealed weapon   but this incident serves as more evidence that the Second Amendment is a  whites-only  thing.Both of these men, like Michael Brown and Eric Garner, John Crawford and the numerous black men gunned down by racist police, clearly did not deserve to die. It s not like they drew a weapon and fired at police. Who would do that, anyway? Oh, right.Ray, 62, was arrested peacefully by police after he innocently stood on the roadside in Wake County, North Carolina, as he pointed his shotgun at passing cars. You know, exercising his Second Amendment rights and all that. When Sheriff s Deputy D.R. Farmerstopped to question him, Ray became belligerent and pointed the shotgun at the officer. This alone would give Farmer reason to, at minimum, draw his weapon. But it gets worse. The deputy luckily grabbed the barrel and pushed him back,  Sheriff Donnie Harrison said.  The man says,  I got something for you  and reached in his pocket and came back with a pistol. Farer pushed the .22-caliber handgun aside, but not before Ray was able to fire off a shot. Luckily, nobody got hurt. That s the good thing. God was looking out for us,  Harrison said.  (Ray) was very fortunate that he didn t get shot, very fortunate that anybody didn t get shot. Why didn t he get shot? What could possibly be the difference between this man and those who were so recently outright murdered by police?Ray s defense attorney and neighbor says mental health is the issue, but police point out that alcohol was a factor as well. Ray was drunk at the time of the incident. After his arrest, Ray continued to be uncooperative with police, snatching cameras off the wall of an interrogation room.He has been charged with two counts of assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm and one count of injury to personal property because of the camera incident.At no point was he beaten, shot, deprived of food and water, or denied medical care. It s almost as though he s considered a human being with rights   which is treatment above and beyond what many African-Americans receive from police across the nation.

There are hundreds of state-funded museums around the world teaching the religion of evolution,  Hovind whined even though evolution is science, not religion.One protester pointed out that those state-funded museums do not discriminate against against people seeking employment the way the Ark museum discriminates against anyone who isn t a Christian who shares their beliefs.Ra responded by noting that unlike creationism, evolution is  demonstrable verifiable science. Hovind s only comeback was to continue branding evolution a  religious worldview. Ra made sure everyone present knew that Hovind s only defense of his beliefs is to tell lies about evolution.Hovind then asked the question that got him owned. Do you believe we came from an ape-like ancestor?  Hovind demanded to know.At this point, Ra used science as a club and beat Hovind over the head with it. Apes don t have tails   learn taxonomy!  Ra said to cheers from the crowd.  So yes, you are an ape, by definition. In fact, he s absolutely right. As Raw Story explained:From a biological standpoint, apes are a classification of anthropoid primates that don t have tails. There are two different families of apes: Hylobatidae and Hominidae. The Hominidae branch includes orangutans, gorillas  and, yes, humans.With no other way to counter Ra, Hovind and his band of thugs resorted to accusing Ra of sounding like Hitler, which pretty much means Hovind knows he got beat.Here s the video via Facebook.The bottom line is that Earth is billions of years old and dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago before humans arrived on the scene. Stunts like the Ark park are efforts by organized religion to brainwash kids.Taxpayer dollars should never have been used to help build this abomination and quite frankly it should open the door for the government to finally tax the churches. Because if churches can receive tax dollars to help them push their bullshit, they should have to pay taxes in return.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The problem is, he did so by invoking his Jewish grandparents  history in the Holocaust, and now his family is rightfully livid at him for it.Because really, he s going to defend an anti-Semitic image by saying his grandparents are Holocaust survivors so he knows better than the evil media what is and isn t anti-Semitic? Where has he been living that he thinks this is okay? In a bubble that s under a rock, which is deep in a cave in the middle of the Himalayas?Marc Kushner, Jared s first cousin, responded to this brown-nosing butt-fuckery with a link to Jared s op-ed, and this simple statement at the top: I have a different take-away from my Grandparents  experience in the war. It is our responsibility as the next generation to speak up against hate. Anti-semitism or otherwise. It was Jacob Schulder, another cousin, though, that really let loose on both Jared and the Anti-Semite-in-Chief with a comment that appears to have since been deleted, but that Politico still has: When an out of touch with reality nominee hires an out of touch with reality campaign manager, who is also a son -in- law, you get the BS Jared wrote. I don t think Trump is an anti Semite; I think he s a lying idiot (among other things) with little to no experiences outside his teetering fiefdom of failed development projects, divorces, bankrupted sports leagues, fraudulent  Universities  and golf courses (and the list keeps going). The very first thing a responsible campaign manager should do, I d think, and I mean the very first thing, would be to take away his father- in -law s Twitter account. Even Joseph Kushner would ve had the street smarts to figure that one out while living on boiled potatoes in the forest. Schulder went on to explain exactly how the rest of us know that this was no  accident,  and King Dunce isn t the least bit sorry, so it ll probably happen again: That my grandparents have been dragged into this is a shame. Thank you Jared for using something sacred and special to the descendants of Joe and Rae Kushner to validate the sloppy manner in which you ve handled this campaign. From the references to  Palestine  at the AIPAC conference (which got Donald jeered) to the justification of the itchy Twitter fingers your father in law has, you ve managed to further prove what so many of us have known for many years. Kudos to you for having gone this far  no one expected this. But for the sake of the family name, which may have no meaning to you but still has meaning to others, please don t invoke our grandparents in vain just so you can sleep better at night. It is self serving and disgusting. So what did he say that was so offensive? In an op-ed posted to Observer.com on Wednesday, Kushner said: [T]he worst that his detractors can fairly say about him is that he has been careless in retweeting imagery that can be interpreted as offensive. He then launched into a narrative of his grandparents  history of trying to escape the Nazis in Russia, and some of the horrors they endured while doing so. His grandmother did escape and joined a resistance cell, where she met his grandfather, who had been living in a literal hole in the ground for three years, trying to remain hidden from the Nazis. Then he said: I go into these details, which I have never discussed, because it s important to me that people understand where I m coming from when I report that I know the difference between actual, dangerous intolerance versus these labels that get tossed around in an effort to score political points. Where he s coming from? Oh, that s right, he s coming from His Royal Racism s rear end in the same manner as diarrhea. The thing is, using the Star of David in the manner of that tweet, along with the fact that it originally came from neo-Nazis, is intentionally anti-Semitic. This was no accident of ignorance in any way, shape or form, and someone with family that survived the Holocaust should know a lot better than this.But Kushner has drunk the Kool-Aid mixed by King Dunce himself, and is brainwashed into believing that the Serial-Racist-Tweeter-in-Chief can t possibly be that hateful and bigoted. With that explanation out of the way, the only one left is that the tweet was not anti-Semitic, and Trump is just a little careless.Please.Of course, a source close to Kushner says that he hasn t even spoken to these people in ten years, so they don t matter. That s a bunch of bull cookies right there. Kushner may not have spoken to them in ten years, but he invoked his history, which is their history too, in a public forum. Therefore, it matters. End of.The entire campaign is rife with broad racism, which includes anti-Semitism. Trump has a bad habit of retweeting white supremacists, including neo-Nazi groups. Kushner shouldn t be telling anybody that the anti-Semitic tweet was a mere mistake, especially not if he s going to insult his own family, and their Jewish history, in doing so.Featured image by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for FINCA""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Contrary to much of the information leaking out of the Trump campaign, the younger Trump was adament that people were begging his dad for the chance to be his vice president. Eric didn t mention a single actual name, which makes sense because it was a lie.According to many people the New York Times spoke to, the answer would be an emphatic no: Never,  said Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Gov.

Scott Walker has a visceral negative reaction to Trump s character,  said Ed Goeas, a longtime adviser to the Wisconsin governor.Or, as Senator Lindsey Graham put it,  That s like buying a ticket on the Titanic. Likewise, many of Trump s own top choices have since publicly rejected the offer including Iowa Senator Joni Ernst and Tennessee Senator Bob Corker.So Fox and Friends were left floating hypotheticals with Eric. They brought up Ivanka, whose only qualification appears to be that she briefly made a business out of selling scarves that were dangerously flammable. Eric was smitten with the idea   in his own creepy way. I agree, she s got the beautiful looks. She s got she s smart. She s smart, smart, smart, she s certainly got my vote. She s got the beautiful looks?It appears Eric has taken after his dad in routinely objectifying and sexualizing the women in the Trump family. Donald Trump has spoken at length about the attractiveness of both of his daughters, including musing about the eventual size of daughter Tiffany s breasts while she was still an infant. For Ivanka he s said (joked?) several times that she is so attractive that he would be dating her if she weren t his own offspring. Yeah, she s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren t happily married and, ya know, her father It s unclear whether Trump actually fantasizes about sleeping with his own daughter or if his own worldview is merely so warped by misogyny and sexist gender ideals that his only pride for a woman like Ivanka is that she grew up to be attractive.

Conversations with foreign leaders are inherently classified.In other words, even if terrorists had hacked Clinton s server they would not have learned anything they couldn t have learned from simply picking up a newspaper.Furthermore, the House Republicans conducting these witch hunts have actually put national security at risk AND they also use private emails.As it turns out, Rep. Jason Chaffetz and Rep. Trey Gowdy also use private emails.Alternet reports that Chaffetz uses his private email address on his business card instead of his official government email address and Trey Gowdy also uses his website email address.Here s an image of Chaffetz s business card.Gowdy even outed a CIA operative by releasing documents to the public as he was investigating Clinton for somehow exposing our national security to outside risks. I don t recall him ever calling for himself to be investigated for that.Alternet tried reaching Gowdy for comment but he ignored the request which means he refuses to discuss his own private email uses. It s true that there are legitimate issues with Clinton failing to segregate work and personal email,  Alternet conceded.  But it s troubling that Members of Congress handling sensitive investigations into national security matters such as the Benghazi incident don t appear to be willing to be transparent about their own email practices. Indeed, Congressional Republicans are not the only hypocrites when it comes to emails. Former Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell also used private emails and received classified information on them when they worked in the Bush Administration. And let s not forget the millions of emails that the Bush White House deleted.Clearly, there is a double standard here. Apparently, Republicans have no problem putting national security at risk with their own failure to keep classified information off of private email servers but when a Democrat does it they immediately pounce as if it has never been done before. They declare that it s some major  scandal  even as they are doing the same thing.If Republicans want Hillary Clinton to be arrested so much, they should voluntarily turn themselves in to FBI custody for doing the same thing and much worse. That means President Bush, Karl Rove, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Trey Gowdy, and Jason Chaffetz should all be slapped with shiny metal bracelets.

He just released his remarks after the recent killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, LA, and Philando Castile of Falcon Heights, MN.Here is President Obama s statement in full: All Americans should be deeply troubled by the fatal shootings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. We ve seen such tragedies far too many times, and our hearts go out to the families and communities who ve suffered such a painful loss.Although I am constrained in commenting on the particular facts of these cases, I am encouraged that the U.S. Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation in Baton Rouge, and I have full confidence in their professionalism and their ability to conduct a thoughtful, thorough, and fair inquiry.But regardless of the outcome of such investigations, what s clear is that these fatal shootings are not isolated incidents. They are symptomatic of the broader challenges within our criminal justice system, the racial disparities that appear across the system year after year, and the resulting lack of trust that exists between law enforcement and too many of the communities they serve.To admit we ve got a serious problem in no way contradicts our respect and appreciation for the vast majority of police officers who put their lives on the line to protect us every single day. It is to say that, as a nation, we can and must do better to institute the best practices that reduce the appearance or reality of racial bias in law enforcement.That s why, two years ago, I set up a Task Force on 21st Century Policing that convened police officers, community leaders, and activists. Together, they came up with detailed recommendations on how to improve community policing. So even as officials continue to look into this week s tragic shootings, we also need communities to address the underlying fissures that lead to these incidents, and to implement those ideas that can make a difference. That s how we ll keep our communities safe. And that s how we can start restoring confidence that all people in this great nation are equal before the law.In the meantime, all Americans should recognize the anger, frustration, and grief that so many Americans are feeling   feelings that are being expressed in peaceful protests and vigils. Michelle and I share those feelings. Rather than fall into a predictable pattern of division and political posturing, let s reflect on what we can do better. Let s come together as a nation, and keep faith with one another, in order to ensure a future where all of our children know that their lives matter. Thank you, Mr. President. Your compassion of life and love for all will be a legacy we all shall remember well past your time in office. You are a man of, by and for the people, and it shows each and every day.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The GOP released their latest funding proposal on Wednesday and the plan proposes cuts to the federal grant that helps low-income women access birth control and other family planning services.The Title X Family Planning program, which was established more than 45 years ago, provides reproductive healthcare services to 4.1 million patients each year, preventing approximately 1 million unplanned pregnancies. So naturally, conservatives are hell bent on eliminating Title X.The Huffington Post reports:  The House Appropriations Committee proposed cutting the program in its draft Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies funding bill for fiscal year 2017. This is the fifth time Republicans have attempted to scrap Title X. Under the GOP proposal, $108 million would be cut from programs that focus on preventing teen pregnancies.The funding bill does allocate $390 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to fight the Zika virus, but women s health advocates warn that the middle of a Zika outbreak is not the time to cut funding for contraception. Zika can be transmitted both through mosquitos and sexually. Women who become infected with the virus while pregnant can have babies born with severe birth defects, including microcephaly. Babies born with microcephaly have malformed brains and abnormally small heads, and they face a lifetime of challenges.Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, said that cutting funding smack dab in the middle of the Zika outbreak would be  particularly foolish. It is particularly foolish to target Title X at a time when the nation is at the precipice of a public health emergency resulting from the Zika virus. For the House to propose defunding the very provider network that is being called upon to address and control the risk to women who may be seeking to prevent pregnancy is absurd.Republicans in Congress have such a dislike for Title X because some of its funding goes to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions among its range of services. None of that money pays for abortions, however, and federal law already prevents these grants from being used to fund abortions.According to a statement released by House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), the goal of the funding bill is to reduc[e] discretionary spending by more than half a billion dollars, all the while prioritizing funding where it is needed the most. It follows the responsible lead of the legislation before it   investing in proven, effective programs, rolling back over regulation and overreach by the Administration that kills American jobs, and cutting spending to save hard earned taxpayer dollars.Last month, the House passed a funding proposal for Zika that also limits access to contraception. This completely ignores the request by the CDC for money to distribute birth control and condoms in areas stricken by Zika.Dana Singiser, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, called the bill  shameful. Politicians who want to eliminate these vital services are working against a solution, and are part of the problem. Today s budget bill is shameful and exposes the Republican leadership s targeted agenda against family planning providers like Planned Parenthood, despite their absolutely critical role in limiting the damaging effects of Zika virus and continuing to provide access to reproductive health services for those most in need.Since last year, 24 states have tried to defund Planned Parenthood. Many of the states that are expected to be hardest hit by Zika as temperatures rise and mosquitos flourish are also states where  lawmakers have slashed family planning services, chipped away at safe and legal abortion and declined to expand Medicaid coverage.

They agree with me, and they believe in me, and I got more votes than anybody in the history of primary elections,  Trump replied.  Nobody s ever even gotten close, the Republicans. I got more than Ronald Reagan, I got more than Richard Nixon, I got more than Dwight Eisenhower, I got more than anybody But I have to say, the Republicans better get smart, they better start sticking together.  Source: Breitbart.comTrump s claim is absolutely true. Do you feel that? That s a collective chill going down the spines of every sane person on the planet. Fortunately for all of sanity, it s not as simple as Trump or some in the media claim. Trump did not bypass Ronald Reagan or even Mitt Romney in the popular vote, and here s why: In the simplest of terms, we have a lot more people than we did when Reagan ran in 1980 and even when Romney ran in 2012.The truth doesn t bode well for Trump:In 1980, Ronald Reagan won 7.7 million votes in the Republican contests in a country that had more than 80 million fewer people of voting age. Further, more than a dozen states held non-binding caucuses that the candidates largely ignored. Adjusting for the population increase and the number of meaningful primary contests today, Reagan likely would have won close to 14 million votes   significantly more than Trump received, according to a HuffPost analysis.Adjusting George W. Bush s 12 million votes from 2000 the same way suggests he might have won 14.5 million votes. And adjusting 1952 s numbers, Eisenhower might have received 13.6 million votes, while Taft might have won 18.6 million   both more than Trump received.But the biggest GOP winner in modern times, according to the HuffPost analysis, was Richard Nixon in 1960, when the sitting vice president won 5 million votes in just 13 contests   suggesting Nixon could have won 25.6 million votes with today s voting population and primary schedule.Source: Huffington PostLet s compare that to Hillary Clinton. In 2008, both she and Barack Obama nearly tied with more than 17 million votes each. This year, her vote totals are lower (about 16 million) but they are still greater than Donald Trump s.Of course, like most of Trump s boasts, these numbers mean absolutely nothing.

Standing in front of the bankrupt and shuttered Trump Plaza Casino, Clinton exposed Trump s lies and mocked him in a brilliant, scathing speech.Speaking to a crowd of about 500 people, Clinton pointed out how Trump s involvement in New Jersey had caused  multiple bankruptcies, stiffing contractors and spurring hundreds of job losses.  Warning voters that Trump would do exactly what he did in Atlantic City to America if he won the election, she said: Remember what he promised:  I m going to do for the country what I did for my business.  We should believe him and make sure he never has the chance to bankrupt America the way he bankrupted his businesses. Clinton s speech was only 30 minutes long, but it was all she needed to take Trump and his scammy business endeavors down. Making a perfect example out of Trump Plaza, Clinton joked: Donald Trump once predicted it was the biggest hit yet. Now it s abandoned. Now ask yourself, according to the Donald, isn t he supposed to be some sort of amazing businessman? What in the world happened here? She was especially passionate because this topic hit home for the presumptive Democratic candidate, whose father was a small business owner. She said,  This is personal for me  as she cited an example of how Trump left small business owners with unpaid bills: The people he is trying to convince to vote for him now are the same people he s been exploiting for years: Working people, small business people, trying to support their families. He got rich and got out. And he thinks that s something to be proud of. He didn t just take advantage of investors, he took advantage of working people as well. Here are some highlights from her speech, which show just how brutal Clinton was:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterClinton also made sure to trash one of Trump s biggest supporters, former presidential candidate and New Jersey governor Chris Christie, for being away campaigning with Trump instead of looking after his state. Clinton said:Clinton s main message to Americans was that when Trump is left in charge of anything,  people get hurt and Donald gets paid.

While the war ended up being a costly and deadly mistake, propelled by lies, Republicans have long held on to the belief that getting rid of Hussein was a huge bonus for the world. Donald Trump, the GOP frontrunner for President, though, disagrees. To Trump, Saddam Hussein should have been praised. Saddam Hussein was a bad guy. Right? He was a bad guy, really bad guy. But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn t read them the rights   they didn t talk, they were a terrorist, it was over,  Trump said as many in his audience of about 2,000 laughed on Tuesday evening.  Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism. You want to be a terrorist, you go to Iraq. It s like Harvard. Okay? So sad. Source: Independent UKHere s the video:Republicans aren t at all happy: He was one of the 20th century s most evil people. He was up there. He committed mass genocide against his own people using chemical weapons,  Ryan told Fox News  Megyn Kelly when asked for his reaction.  Saddam Hussein was a bad guy. This isn t the first time Trump has said something similar. Back in October, Trump said if both Muammar Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein were still in power, the Middle East would be a more stable region.He related the situations in both of those countries with what is currently happening in Syria and seemed to endorse a stronger Bashar Assad, even while admitting that he is  probably a bad guy.   You can make the case, if you look at Libya, look at what we did there   it s a mess   if you look at Saddam Hussein with Iraq, look what we did there   it s a mess   it s [Syria] going to be same thing,  the real estate mogul said.Source: MSNBCTrump isn t alone in having that belief. Many Democrats, including Bernie Sanders, share his opinion. Yes, things were more stable during Hussein s regime, but Think Progress makes the point that the Arab Spring, which caused the ousting and death of Muammar Qaddafi, would have still happened, and it would have affected Iraq.The current state of countries like Iraq, Syria, and Libya has been influenced by foreign involvement and regime change, there is no denying that. But even more constructive in the current chaos is a surviving legacy of political repression and brutal torture. Sanders, Cruz, Paul and the like may be using the premise of stability to argue that the Middle East would be better off under such dictators. Yet under such despots, security is fleeting and chaos follows closely.Again, there s no legitimate defense of the Iraq War, and perhaps the region would have less terrorism now if we hadn t overthrown him (although much of the terrorism is related to our occupation, and not to the overthrow of the government). This can all be debated, and will be debated, for possibly decades.However, the most frightening aspect of Trump s comments is his obsession with dictators. Not only has he praised Hussein and Qaddafi, he s also praised Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un. That s a frightening hint at how he plans to run the nation.Featured image via Sara D.

Her complaint is that she was fired because she wouldn t sleep with him, and that women who didn t complain or rebuff him received preferential treatment.Her account rings true, especially to those of us who have likewise experienced that kind of harassment in the workplace, and the retaliation that so often comes with it despite all the laws and company policies on the books. It s further bolstered by the fact that Ailes has a long history of being an openly dirty old man who has zero regard for women as anything more than his sex toys: While interviewing Randi Harrison, a twenty-something out-of-work producer who had come in from Florida, Ailes steered the conversation onto uncomfortable terrain. According to Harrison, Ailes looked over at his NBC office couch and said,  I have helped a lot of women get ahead and advance their careers in the broadcast television industry.  They were discussing her salary. Ailes offered $400 a week. Harrison told him it was a lowball figure. Ailes made a counteroffer:  If you agree to have sex with me whenever I want, I will add an extra hundred dollars a week.' I guess we ll be in touch,  Harrison said, getting up to leave. Ailes maneuvered around his desk and gave her a hug.  I remember seeing all the windows in his office and wondering,  Does he do it here?  she later said.  I was in tears by the time I hit the street.' That comes from a book called The Loudest Voice in the Room, and Fox News claims the allegations in the book are false, as companies are wont to do when their CEOs turn out to be nothing more than sexist, disgusting pigs.That s not all, though. Ailes reportedly once called down to the control booth to yell that a laptop was blocking his view of one of his host s legs, and he wanted it moved so he could have a better view. A senior executive also said that Ailes once told him he wasn t paying another female host to wear pantsuits, and that he wanted to see more of her legs.He has a thing for women s legs, according to that executive.There are, of course, those who will say Carlson is either lying (why would she? She had one of the top-rated shows there so she wasn t fired for poor performance), or that she brought this on herself. The latter will be either those who think women encourage harassment and rape, or those who believe that, since she worked for Fox News and helped perpetuate rape culture, she somehow deserves this. They are idiotic sexists no matter where they fall on the political spectrum.The former will be mostly those who think women are vindictive bitches, and are just out to ruin men s lives. These are misogynists who think women have too much power these days and need to be cut down.At the time of this posting, Fox News had yet to issue a statement on the matter.Featured image by Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

After all, the guy is political poison for anyone who wants a post-Trump political career. Two potential VP picks, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), have now withdrawn themselves from the short list of potential candidates for consideration for Trump s running mate.Of course, in her remarks, Ernst was in no way critical of Trump. She s clearly one of those party-before-country types who won t say a bad word against The Donald, but she also seems to want nothing to do with potentially being vice president under such a man. Ernst said: I made that very clear to him that I m focused on Iowa. I feel that I have a lot more to do in the United States Senate. And Iowa is where my heart is. I m just getting started here. I have a great partner with Chuck Grassley, we ve been able to accomplish a lot. And I think that President Trump will need some great assistance in the United States Senate and I can provide that. Like all good Republican toy soldiers lining up behind their bigoted standard-bearer, Ernst still wants there to be a President Trump, and says she will do what she can to make that happen. She said of the baffling decision to make sure the orange one is elected: I will probably participate more as an advocate. I would love to assist him out on the trail. Senator Corker was much less enthusiastic when announced his own withdrawal, only saying: There are people far more suited for being a candidate for vice president and I think I m far more suited for other types of things. There were no laudatory words about Trump, and nor was there any kind of promise to help Trump get elected. In other words, this guy is not going to be associated with Donald Trump in any way. And who can blame him? Trump s bigotry, praise of dictators, ignorance of the rule of law and any number of other repugnant things make him absolute political poison.Trump better stick to Christie and Gingrich.

Rather, they care about Those People coming into  their  country because they think they re criminals and terrorists. And yes, this is an explicitly race-based attitude:Complementary to that analysis, Americans  views about immigration differ substantially according to where the immigrants are from; immigrants from Europe and Asia are viewed much more positively than immigrants from Africa and Latin America, and immigrants from the Middle East are viewed least positively of all. The poll also shows that this dynamic is heavily influenced by the specific views of white Americans   while black and Hispanic Americans evaluate the impact of European and Latin American immigrants similarly, for example, white Americans are much more enthusiastic about immigration from Europe than from Latin America.In other words, white people are racist assholes.And it s even more depressing that it sounds if you look at the break down of responses:Don t know/No opinion is 29% so that s a little ray of sunshine. But  Weakens the economy,  the only semi-legitimate complaint, is just 18%. That leaves over 50% of the remaining answers in the  Complete Bullshit  category. The totally made up complaints of  Hurts national security  and  Increases crime  are a combined 39%. And the most insulting of all is 14% for  Weakens American values.

Snyder, who is globally infamous for overseeing the poisoning of the city of Flint, Michigan, is now trying to re-steal more than half a billion dollars from Michigan s teachers.In 2010, a law was passed that forced school employees to contribute 3 percent of their pay to their healthcare retirement benefits. The law was ruled as unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals on June 7. That means that the already collected $550 million dollars that are currently held in escrow must be returned to the school employees that it was originally stolen from. Governor Snyder s decision to drag this case out, even though the Attorney General will not assist in the appeal, is a shameful use of the people s time and money. School employees deserve to have their hard-earned money returned to them as soon as possible, but instead they will have to wait as Governor Snyder spends more time defending what is clearly an unconstitutional law,  said David Hecker, president of American Federation of Teachers Michigan.That ruling doesn t fit into Snyder s master plan. He is now suing to appeal the court s decision. The suit is so frivolous and politically toxic that even the governor s Republican comrade, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schutte isn t willing to touch it with a ten-foot pole.

According to his own kids, Bill O Reilly, the network s figurehead, is a domestic abuser with an awful temper who has himself been the subject of sexual harassment lawsuits. The network aggressively promotes blonde women and is known to focus an inordinate amount of time on their bare legs. That directive comes directly from Ailes, who once reportedly called down to the control both absolutely furious that an errant laptop was blocking the shot of one of his hosts  legs while she was reading the news. Move that damn laptop, I can t see her legs! And once told former host Catherine Crier: Be more opinionated,  he told Crier in one meeting.  The guests are there as a foil for you.

The entire scene was caught on camera by some bystanders and the community is furious at what appears to be yet another black man unnecessarily killed by white cops.Warning. This video contains graphic violence:While the police were  forced  to tackle Sterling, once they wrestled him to the ground, he puts up little struggle. Considering how big he is (he appears to be about at least 6 feet tall and well over 200 pounds), if he was resisting, one would expect a lot more movement. And when the cops pull their guns on him, it s not all clear that Sterling was in any position to shoot them.Amazingly, the officers involved were given time to get their stories straight:In a statement, Baton Rouge Police Cpl. L Jean McKneely Jr. said two officers  have been placed on administrative leave per standard procedure,  though it is believed that only one officer fired shots.The officers have not been named. Our guys will most likely review the video tomorrow,  McKneely told The Washington Post in an email Tuesday night. We give officers normally a day or so to go home and think about it  before being interviewed, McKneely told the Advocate.It s good to be a cop in America.The police are almost certain to claim that Sterling was  reaching  for a gun but an eyewitness is already disputing this. Abdullah Muflahi, the owner of the Triple S, said the police clearly had a chip on their shoulder when they confronted Sterling and there was no reason to pull their guns and shoot him:Muflahi told the Advocate, His hand was nowhere [near] his pocket,  and that Sterling was not holding a weapon.Then, Muflahi said that the officer who fired the shots began cursing and that both seemed to be  freaking out. Finally, the store owner said he heard one of the officers say,  Just leave him. Muflahi said he saw police retrieve a gun from Sterling s pocket after the shooting. Just leave him.  There s that compassion and humanity for minorities that American law enforcement is known for.Unfortunately, Sterling had a criminal record that included  aggravated battery, domestic abuse, possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute and illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance  so there is literally no chance the cops involved will face any kind of justice even if the security tape from the store shows Sterling s hand nowhere near his pocket at any time.Featured image via twitter""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This is for the real organizers all over the country, activist civil rights attorneys, the parents, the teachers, the students who are realizing that a system built to divide and impoverish and destroy us cannot stand if we do. All right?  he explained.  It s kind of basic mathematics, the more we learn about who we are and how we got here, the more we will mobilize. Despite its peaceful yearning for racial understanding, for some reason conservatives and racists were set off by the speech. An online petition was launched, asking that Williams be fired from his position on the TV show, and said he  spewed a racist, hate speech against law enforcement and white people at the BET awards.  The petition creator, Erin Smith, compared the speech to racist outbursts from TV personality Paula Deen and a homophobic rant from actor Isaiah Washington.But Shonda Rhimes, the creator and producer of Grey s Anatomy, who has been called the most powerful woman in television, did not bow to the online mob.The ShondaLand producer fired back Monday night at a 7,000 signature-strong Change.org petition calling for ABC to ax Williams   who plays hunky Dr. Jackson Avery on the doctor drama   in light of his much-praised speech inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement. Um, people? Boo don t need a petition. #shondalandrules,  Rhimes tweeted.Rhimes has used her programs to advocate for racial and gender equality, and her programs have been a ratings bonanza for ABC.

Apparently citing a Middle Eastern dictator as his model for combating international terrorism, Trump went on to praise Iraq under Hussein s iron fisted rule as a nation that didn t bother with reading rights to accused suspects.Moving forward to the current time, Trump said that Iraq in 2016 was  like Harvard  for terrorists. Like many of his other speeches outside of those delivered with a teleprompter, it didn t make much sense.When Saddam Hussein was captured by the U.S. after the invasion of Iraq, he was put on trial and accused of the murder of 148 people, torture of women and children, and with illegally arresting at least 399 people. He was found guilty of crimes against humanity, and was sentenced to death and hanged.Trump has consistently made a mess of speaking about terrorism, arguing for waterboarding (which military experts say is a useless tool for extracting information and is considered torture under the Geneva Conventions) and for engaging in the barbaric practice of murdering the families of terrorists, even if they had nothing to do with terrorist acts.The Republican nominee has also played fast and loose with the facts on terrorism, blaming the Orlando attack on Syrian refugees when the shooter was a natural-born American citizen. Trump has also been at the head of the line on the right that has blamed all terrorism on Muslims, and called for a ban on Muslim travel to the United States and a system to track Muslims within the United States.Trump s supporters have cheered on his advocacy of big brother, fascist policies, with some going so far as to refer to Trump as  daddy,  for the paternalistic world view he has offered many of them who are skeptical of a black President.In reality, President Obama has had more senior leadership within terror networks like al Qaeda and ISIS targeted and killed during his tenure than his predecessor.

And they don t look like Indians to Indians. And a lot of people are laughing at it,  Trump said in the remarks dated 1993, apparently shocking the congressman questioning him, who likened the remarks to historical racism. Trump said,  Only Indians can have the gaming . . . Why are you being discriminatory? Why is it that the Indians don t pay tax, but everybody else does. I do.

Source: Mass LiveGot it, so it was the  nice  use of the word  faggot.  Of course, Busiek s history might indicate otherwise. I already mentioned that he s against same-sex adoptions, and of course, he s against same-sex marriage. He, like many Trump supporters, is also concerned about losing his rank as a white man on the (excuse the pun) totem pole.Claiming a  cultural rift  exists between State House politicians and a sizable section of the Bay State s population, Busiek told the News Service he spoke for  anybody who works for a living,  and those who find themselves  under attack  for their  oppressor status  as white, male and successful.

Maybe I m engaging in identity politics, too,  Busiek said, though he said he disagrees with that point of view because, he said, identity politics is contingent on being  born into a victim class. If Busiek s tweet proves anything, it s that Trump is merely a mirror reflecting the bigotry of his supporters. Trump is a truly horrible human being, who insults women and basically every minority, but he says very little about LGBT people. If anything, he s been historically supportive. Of course, that s not to say Trump won t tweet something ugly about gay people today.

This makes it truly a sad day for the GOP, and you can tell how bitter they are just by the interviews they re giving.After the FBI made that announcement, Republican Nation Committee (RNC) chief strategist Sean Spicer was in an embarrassing amount of denial when he went on CNN and insisted that the FBI had issued a  clear indictment  of Clinton s judgement, despite the fact that it didn t recommend a formal indictment at all. Spicer got so worked up over the fact the Clinton wouldn t be charged that he completely lost it, and threw a bit of a temper tantrum over the investigation s results. Spicer said: These findings of the FBI are a clear indictment on Hillary Clinton s judgement and fitness to be president. The office that she s seeking requires the highest level of judgement, making sure that our nation s secrets are protected. CNN host Kate Bolduan reminded Spicer that the FBI had said that  no reasonable prosecutor  would even think about bringing charges against Clinton.Not fully understanding the irony that his party s candidate is the most unfit presidential candidate of our time, Spicer snapped back, This is someone who wants to be president, Kate! Bolduan then cornered Spicer and asked him if he trusted the FBI to conduct a fair investigation, and the RNC strategist had to admit that he did. Spicer confessed: Well, it sounds like it. The findings that they made are very clear that she did exhibit poor judgement, that it was reckless by their account. And it is not their job to decide whether it is formally prosecuted. John Berman jumped in to point out that Trump had also disagreed with the FBI s assessment, calling it  very very unfair.  Spicer decided to defend Trump and accuse Clinton of rigging the system. I m not a lawyer. If she had followed the law and used a State Department account or even used a private system like the director pointed out like Gmail then this wouldn t be a problem. She chose to set up a system for herself around the rules that were established for everybody else for a reason. And that reason is she didn t want people to know what she was doing.Any other employee that works at the State Department that did what she did would have their security clearance pulled and would be facing charges. This is absolutely ridiculous. Bolduan took another opportunity to make a complete idiot out of Spicer, when she followed up with this question: Donald Trump in his tweet called this  very very unfair.  Do you think the investigation was unfair or do you agree with your candidate who thinks it was  very very unfair? All Spicer could do was reluctantly say that the investigation was fair, but that he still agreed with Trump that Clinton should be prosecuted. He lamented: The system clearly looks like when the FBI turned it over, the Department of Justice has already seemed to make it very clear what they re going to do with this.

However, after the humiliation of the latest fruitless Benghazi panel, you d think that they d be a little more skittish about launching more investigations that are politically motivated. You d be wrong. They re about to do it again.House GOP leaders are looking at launching a frivolous investigation, this time into the House Democrats who were involved in last month s sit-in, to determine whether they should be punished for it. Republicans just can t get past the idea that something is only American, is only patriotic, if they agree with it. Very little is more patriotic than civil disobedience, and that s what the sit-in was.Republicans weren t so quick to jump to investigating Ted Cruz when he and a small cadre of Senate members shut down the entire government for 16 days because of Obamacare, or that Tea Partiers have disrupted other business in both the House and the Senate. They and their minions will say that s because Cruz & Co., and every other Republican, didn t break any rules, and House Democrats did.But at least the Democrats didn t bring the entire government to a standstill. It s only when Democrats disrupt Congress that it s a problem.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy even said: Members of Congress (need) to adhere to the rules and the decorum of what is expected of being on the floor. What an odd interest in adhering to the rules all of a sudden. This is the GOP that s been having all sorts of fun passing closed rules to block amendments. In fact, they broke the record for the most closed rules in Congress. While the party in power can change the rules and make rules all they want (or, at least, that s how that power seems to be used), the House GOP has never shown any interest in actually doing things the right way.McCarthy believes that this isn t what democracy should look like, and claimed he d never seen such blatant flouting of the rules. Oh, please. What absolute bullshit.Nevertheless, they re looking into whether Democrats intimidated the floor staff to break decorum rules so they could engage in a purely political stunt, the purpose of which was to  line their coffers with campaign cash.  Those are ridiculous allegations on their face. Like Hillary Clinton can t possibly be innocent in Benghazi, House Democrats can t possibly have actually done this to try and spur movement on gun legislation.Because that would make the GOP look worse than they already do.Because they can t have this black mark on their record in an election year.Because admitting a mistake and making good-faith efforts to fix it and move forward just aren t the GOP s style.Because the GOP is more about political stunts these days than actually working for the people.That s what Benghazi is for them   a political stunt intended to try and polish an image that s so badly tarnished it s permanently black.Democrats, and the public in general, are sick to death of Congress refusing to do anything anything at all about gun violence in this country. They don t even want to fund research into gun violence as a public health issue because they believe all such research will be politically biased against guns and gun owners. The GOP is too far up the NRA s ass now to be saved.It s a shame Republicans can t see past their own haughty, disgustingly dark brown noses with the NRA brands on them.

Abby Johnson is a pro-life feminist and she has the most thankless job in the world: She s trying to move the anti-abortion movement away from rabid, regressive Christianity and closer to thoughtful, life-affirming feminism. And she s failing. Miserably.Johnson is one of those rare creatures; a pro-lifer that actually cares more about life than control. In other words, where most pro-lifers couldn t care less about the baby they re supposedly  Saving  AFTER it s born, Johnson is fighting to make abortion unnecessary in the first place. As her fellow spitter-in-the-wind, Serrin Foster, the leader of Feminists For Life, says,  There are three key reasons for the feminization of poverty: Lack of education, lack of workplace accommodation and paternal support. Do that, three-fourths of the reasons that women have an abortion are over. And she s not wrong. But that s why the effort to emphasize the  life  in  pro-life  is doomed to failure. Talk to most any conservative anti-abortion person and ask them if they support comprehensive sex education, free contraceptives, pre-natal care, post-natal care, food, clothes and housing for the women and babies they re so  worried  about. The overwhelming majority of them will absolutely refuse. For them, pregnancy is simple a means to an end: Punishing women for having sex.They spend a lot of time crying crocodile tears for the  innocent lives  being lost but have zero interest in preventing unwanted pregnancies or getting women the support they need to care for a baby they can t afford. It s about control and punishment. And is always has been. A fact that Johnson and her fellow feminists are finding out the hard way:While issues such as expanding family leave requirements and access to child care could be an area of consensus for self-identified pro-life and pro-choice feminists   whatever their reasons for supporting them   there seemed to be little enthusiasm at the conference for working with pro-choicers on these causes.When Johnson asked who  the abortion movement  was united behind, an audience member yelled out,  the devil!  (The answer was Planned Parenthood.) The Devil.  Clearly, these are rational people who can think clearly about the best way to prevent abortions. And when Johnson discussed Hillary Clinton, a woman that has spent decades fighting for women s rights? That didn t go so well with the crowd of  concerned  women Johnson was speaking to:While Clinton has the clearly better record on policies supporting mothers   policies that speakers like Foster and Jacobson said help dissuade women from choosing abortion   the only positive references to presidential candidates at the event were allusions to Donald Trump s promises to pick Supreme Court justices who would roll back Roe v. Wade. Anti-choice leaders as a whole have rallied behind Trump, who besides vowing to  cherish  women and appoint anti-choice judges, has not offered any serious plans for improving the lot of women in the workforce or helping women out of poverty.As long as the anti-abortion movement overwhelmingly views an unwanted pregnancy as a punishment for women, they will NEVER stop trying to make abortion illegal in the United States. In a perfect world, Johnson would be leading an army of women to Washington to pass laws giving women everything they need to raise a unplanned child in safety and good health, thus ending almost all need for an abortion. Instead, she s going to waste her time trying to convince women who clearly hate other women that they should really be pro-life instead of pro-control.Good luck with that.Photo by Pete Marovich/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The anti-defamation league denounced the tweet. Clinton called it blatantly anti-Semitic. Your reaction to Donald Trump s use of that image?SPEAKER PAUL RYAN: Look, anti-Semitic images have no place in a presidential campaign. Candidates should know that. The tweet has been deleted. I don t know what flunky put this up there. They obviously have to fix that. We have to get back to the issues that matter to the public. I was doing the Kenosha parade, the Marine parade, grilling brats with volunteers and families, if I had to stop everything and comment to a ridiculous tweet sent out by this campaign I would have no time for anything else.SYKES: Yeah, well, this is like the fifth time though that Donald Trump, who you are supporting let me remind you.RYAN: I know, you have reminded me this.SYKES: I know. But has tweeted something that at some point does Reince Priebus or somebody else need to get him on the phone and say,  Mr. Trump you have got to stop tweeting these things. These things are no longer accidents. RYAN: Yeah, I really believe he needs to clean up the way his new media works. Most importantly, as you know, one of the few times I spoke out against him during the primary very forcefully was in this area. When he failed to disavow supremacists, white supremacists. So look, I think this is really really clear, the point is, I think he needs to clean this up. My understanding this was done by staff not by he himself. More importantly they got  to clean this thing up.Well, Paul Ryan is right there. He can t keep up with every racist thing Trump does. After all, Trump and/or his campaign staffers tweet insanely bigoted things in one variety or another on an almost daily basis at this point. It s like David Duke himself is running that campaign. However, the thing that Ryan needs to do is this: publicly rescind his endorsement of Donald Trump. He s clearly a bigot of the first order, and therefore has absolutely NO BUSINESS being president of the United States. This isn t about cleaning up social media. It s about clear, deliberate, and obvious bigotry.Paul Ryan and the rest of the GOP know this, but instead they keep pushing for a literal bigoted fascist to become the next leader of the free world.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The FBI went through all of the emails she provided as well through emails received by people she was in contact with. They even reconstructed as many deleted personal emails as they could from her hard drives. Think of the super cool scenes in Hollywood movies where hackers recover deleted emails except it s a really long and tedious process.A lot of people have been praying and hoping that the FBI would find a smoking gun and for a few minutes, it seemed like they had when Comey announced that they had found 3 emails with classified information: 1 at the secret level and 2 at the confidential levels (secret is a higher classification than confidential).However, Comey also explained that there was absolutely no evidence that those emails had been deleted as an attempt to cover anything up. He even explained the process by which her lawyers would have unintentionally deleted emails they should have turned over. This may sound like he was defending Clinton but he was simply explaining the process that led the FBI to their conclusions that no criminal actions were taken.Comey also explained that while there is no direct evidence that Hillary s servers were hacked, they were definitely at risk and there is no way to know that they weren t hacked because of the way the system was set up. That might sound like splitting hairs but it s an important distinction. If the proper precautions had been taken, it would have been easier to definitively know if something had happened.Comey went on to tear the State Department a new one over their  extremely careless  handling of classified material but finally got to the FBI s recommendation:In our system, the prosecutors makes the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evident the FBI helps collect. Although we don t normally make public our recommendation to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversation with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order.Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, out judgement is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.Comey also said,  We cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. This doesn t necessarily end the saga of Hillary s emails as the Department of Justice could still decide to press charges anyway, although it s unclear what they would hope to accomplish given the lack of evidence. The most likely outcome is that Donald Trump just lost his best chance at defeating Hillary and after a few weeks of him bellowing that the fix was in, no one will remember what all the drama was about.Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This year s annual White House Fourth of July picnic on the lawn had to be canceled due to rain, but the President and Michelle Obama decided to move the party inside where they hosted numerous military families. Since it was his daughter s birthday, President Obama decided to do what dads do best   embarrass her by being her dad. It just so happens we celebrate our country s birthday on the same day as my oldest daughter s birthday, so just a quick Happy Birthday for Malia, the President told the crowd. He then broke into a croaky, frankly terrible rendition of  Happy Birthday  that was somehow perfect in every way.As he wrapped up the song, Malia stepped in to give her father a huge hug in what is possibly the most touching father-daughter moment of the many we have witnessed.Preceding this touching moment between Obama and his daughter were some beautiful remarks about our country. Obama called the United States a  miracle,  saying that we are lucky  that people generations ago were willing to take up arms and fight for our freedom. Independence is not something that just happens,  he told the crowd. It s something that we have to fight for every single day. It s something that we have to nurture and we have to spread the word and we have to work on. President Obama said that the most important thing about freedom is that we ensure that everyone has opportunities in this country   that they can put a roof over their heads and contribute to society. It is important to recognize imperfections and fight to make things better for everyone, Obama said.Watch this touching scene unfold below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He is also the most outrageously dangerous major party presidential candidate that America has seen in recent memory   perhaps ever. Well, many people on both the left and the right know this, and have jumped on the #NeverTrump train. Now, there is a very interesting development: a group of women who have been lifelong Republicans doing all they can to elect presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton.The group is calling itself  Republican Women for Hillary,  and spent their 4th of July evening holding the first meeting of their fledgling organization at Washington s St. Regis Hotel. These women are definitely not your typical Hillary supporters. One of them admittedly spent copious amounts of time campaigning against abortion rights, and another is a Southern Baptist who is basically against everything Hillary Clinton and Democrats in general stand for. However, their mission is to make sure Donald Trump never gets anywhere near the Oval Office   even if it means doing all they can to elect Hillary Clinton.U.S. Chamber of Commerce employee and staunch Republican Jennifer Lim, who helped found the group, explains the logic: It s really important that Republican leaders, especially Republican women leaders, stand up right now and say we re not OK with Trump representing our party. This is not a position I ever wanted to find myself in. But it s important that when things like this happen that people speak up. It is important to note that this group is in no way affiliated with the Clinton campaign, but they do intend to do their own campaigning and activist activities, including urging people to vote for Clinton, while also helping conservatives facing political backlash for condemning Donald Trump and his destructive, dangerous campaign.Here is the tweet from the group s twitter, endorsing Clinton:We're with her! #GOPwithHer #ImWithHer https://t.co/FhKIaa6BX5  RWFH (@GOPWomenWithHer) June 7, 2016Meghan Milloy, who is a member of Republican Woman for Hillary but also works for a conservative think tank called American Action Forum, seems conflicted and it is clear the decision was not easy to join this group. However, her resolve is solid. She says:  It has been tough for me to come to this point where I can vote for a candidate who has been very against what I ve been working for for most of my professional career. That being said, I can t vote for someone like Donald Trump because he s overtly racist and misogynist.

The teen was rushed by ambulance to Sarasota Memorial Hospital, where he died as result of a gunshot injury.According to WFLA: William Brumby was positioned in the last shooting lane where there was a solid wall on his right-hand side. After firing a round, the spent shell casing struck the wall causing it to deflect and fall into the back of Mr. Brumby s shirt. That s when the teen s father reached his other hand, which was holding the gun, behind his back to remove the shell. The gun was accidentally discharged. The bullet struck the 14-year-old, who was standing behind his father at the time. He was shot in the neck.Brumby s 12-year-old daughter and adult son were both present at the time of the shooting.During an interview with Fox 13, David Brumby, the brother of the teen who was killed, said immediately upon realizing he had shot his son, William Brumby began screaming and begging someone to call 911. He described the shooting as a  freak one-in-a-million accident. David Brumby told Fox 13 that his father wanted the 14-year-old to learn to shoot a gun so that he would be able to  protect himself. The High Noon Gun Range was built in 2013. At the time it opened, it was described as  the safest gun range ever designed,  by the Herald Tribune.According to the company s website, the first three  rules of the range are:I will handle all firearms as if they are LOADED.I will keep my finger off the trigger when not immediately firing my weapon at my designated target.Finger must be out of the gun s trigger guard and off the trigger until your sights are aligned on a safe target and you have made the decision to fire.I will always be certain of my target, direction of my shot, and the surrounding areas before firing.The problem with deadly weapons is that they re deadly. If you make a mistake, as everyone is bound to do at some point, people end up dead.  Oops I forgot to take my finger off the trigger,  suddenly becomes  Oops I just killed my own son.

Independence Day weekend can be annoying as all hell because it seems like there s always someone shooting off pyrotechnics, having a loud party or barbecue, or otherwise making a major nuisance of themselves. That s no reason to fire a gun at someone, though, especially when that someone is a child.Unfortunately, that s what a Wisconsin man did when he got fed up with a 10-year old child shooting off fireworks in his neighborhood, because, you know, when someone pisses you off that s what you do these days: Solve it with a gun.It was the child himself who called the police, and, of course, the man tried to lie his way out of it by saying he was merely shooting off fireworks, too. That lie didn t last very long, and he eventually admitted that he d fired his .40 caliber pistol in the child s direction. What a clusterfuck of a human being.It s not clear whether the child s parents were home, but what happened to going over to the neighbor s house to politely ask them to stop with the noise, or working something out that would be mutually agreeable? Alas, to many so-called  responsible  gun owners, it s not, and they d rather threaten, or even harm, people who piss them off.This guy may even be part of the 1 in 10 here who are pathologically angry and have access to a firearm. Nobody who isn t, at minimum, full of rage would consider pointing a loaded gun at a child and pulling the trigger for any reason. Nobody in their right mind would consider anybody who does that a  responsible gun owner.  Yet even gun owners who pull this kind of nonsense seem to think they re  responsible. Instead of spending money on guns, these people need to go buy a clue.The child is unharmed, and the man has been arrested. He currently faces charges of recklessly endangering safety, as well he should. He should also undergo a psych evaluation geared at finding out just how deep his anger runs that he thought firing a gun at a kid because he was annoyed was okay.Featured image by George Frey/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It didn t go well for Lewandowski, and it didn t go well for Michael Caputo, who tried to come to Trump s rescue earlier today.In a Monday morning interview with CNN, the former Trump campaign advisor tried to make the case that Trump shouldn t be apologizing for the anti-Semitic post. According to Caputo, there was nothing to be sorry about: This was not intended to offend anyone. Caputo also denied that the star s shape was the Star of David, and insisted that it was merely a geometric image that some associate with the horrible days of Nazi Germany. Reminding everyone that the Trump campaign did in fact fix the Star of David debacle by slapping a circle over it, Caputo continued: This was an unforced error, there s no question about it, otherwise they wouldn t have changed it. But to apologize for it? I don t think so. TwitterThe interview got even more insane as Caputo insisted that almost no one found the image offensive (which is a lie) and accused the media of making a big deal of the red Star of David s appearance on the image to distract people from focusing on the FBI investigation on Hillary Clinton s emails.Unable to take this nonsense any longer, CNN s John Berman stepped in and pointed out that the meme had appeared on a site that was trafficked by neo-Nazis. This caused Caputo to basically lose his mind and fire back,  Do you know that? Do you know that? Berman replied,  Yes! , which inspired Caputo to basically lie again and say that Trump s social media team had no control in choosing what images were tweeted from Trump s Twitter account because they were  deluged at all times [with] incoming images from people who make them who want the campaign to use them. That s the dumbest excuse Caputo could have come up with, but there s probably some truth in it. Basically, Caputo is saying that Trump s social media staff has been so overwhelmed with people sending them Nazi images, they felt obligated to post one.

A LOT more.Even as the economy recovers from the financial collapse engineered by the rich, those same people managed to reap almost all the rewards, leaving the rest of us to scramble for the scraps. And while the rich whine about how persecuted they are, a new study shows that income inequality in America is at an all time high with no signs of slowing down.How bad is it? Very:While the past two years have been good for the majority of Americans  income growth, they still haven t fully recovered from the recession. For the bottom 99 percent, incomes fell 11.6 percent during the height of the recession from 2007 to 2009. Afterward, they grew just 7.6 percent between 2009 and 2015   not enough to make up for the downturn. Incomes for the 99 percent have only recovered about 60 percent of what they lost.But the rich are doing great. The incomes of the 1 percent grew 37 percent between 2009 and 2015. They captured more than half of all the income growth in the country over that period, leaving just 48 percent to spread out among the bottom 99 percent of families.The Washington Post writes about a study of income inequality throughout the entirety of America s existence and the two researchers found that today s inequality is the worst it s ever been and steadily getting worse. Even when the country was first founded and most people lived on farms, the rich were not far separated from the poor. In fact, even the  Gilded Age  which saw obscene amounts of wealth concentrated in the hands of the few was not as obscene as it is now. Here s the chart they used:(Excerpted from Unequal Gains: American Growth and Inequality since 1700. Courtesy of Princeton University Press)If you ll notice, the sharp upturn of income inequality started in the 1970s when unions started to dwindle and corporations started to increase worker productivity while refusing to share the profits from it. You ll also notice that the sharpest climb came after the 2008 financial crisis.This hoarding of wealth is what has lead to the 1% attempting to completely co-opt our system of government by buying politicians outright. The bad news is that this is going to get much worse before it gets better. The good news is that the rich always lose these fights in the end. The British lost when they tried to bleed the colonies dry. The southern slave holders lost when they tried to maintain their control over their  property.  The Robber Barons lost when they tried to turn America into their own personal playground. And the current crop of greedy, soulless 1%ers will lose this time as well.Soon-to-be Hillary Clinton may not go after the rich with both barrels blazing, but she, like Obama before her, will lay the foundation for the 99% to take our country back. By quietly rebuilding the government institutions and courts the GOP crippled, we re going to have the tools we need to wrest control away from the corporations and stop the decline of the middle class and the suffering of the poor.So light those fireworks, America! We re almost ready to declare our independence from the 1%!Featured image via Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Americans across the nation know this is the day our country came into being and we celebrate that by lighting fireworks and spending time with friends and family.But disgraced former Republican Rep. Allen West thinks something sinister is afoot.For years, conservatives have been trying to make everyone believe that there is an imaginary war on Christmas. Such an idea has been very profitable for guys like Mike Huckabee and the folks over at Fox News who constantly claim Christmas is being destroyed by godless liberals even though the war is only occurring in their heads.And now it sounds like West is trying to cash in on that concept by claiming that there is a war against July 4th.In his blog on Monday, West whines about how people simply refer to this day as July 4th instead of the  240th American Independence Day. I see something very disturbing happening today,  he begins.We ve become so damaged by the talons of political correctness that it now threatens the very existence of our Republic. And I mean its very founding.I ve been amazed at how people greet you with  Happy 4th of July , as if we are celebrating a numbered date on the calendar. If this continues, there will be generations who will no longer know what happened on this day, other than we should have cookouts and shoot off fireworks.Today is our 240th American Independence Day, a significant day not just for America, but for the world.Really? Just because people are greeting you today with  Happy 4th of July  that makes you convinced that Americans are forgetting what happened on this day? I see you still haven t had your head examined by a qualified neurologist, Mr. West. You might wanna get that checked.Anyway, West goes on to urge people to read the Declaration of Independence, which is a good learning exercise. However, West uses that call to then attack President Obama and liberals by comparing Obama to King George III and claiming that liberals are trying to subvert the holiday.These are the stories we must teach our children and grandchildren, lest they go off following the failed messages of the progressive socialist left. This is why we must not celebrate the 4th of July, but American Independence Day   or else someone will tell you they re going to  fundamentally transform  your nation and you have no clue what that means.This is why today, I implore y all to take the time to carefully read the entire Declaration of Independence and notice the parallels to the grievances then to today, such as,  He has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their Substance    think IRS and other regulatory agencies.Or how about this one,  He has combined with others to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation    sound familiar? Consider Obama s rule by edict and executive order antithetical to our Constitution.And I love this one:  For imposing taxes on us without our Consent    need I remind you there are twenty new taxes in Obamacare.But just as West was wrong to torture a man in Iraq for information when he was a Lieutenant Colonel, he is woefully wrong now.First of all, President Obama was duly elected to his position by the American people. He is not a king and he his second term in office will be finished in January, and he will leave office. If he were a king, he would never leave.President Obama is not the only commander-in-chief to issue executive orders. Every single president except for one has issued an executive order, including George Washington. He issued 8 such orders. Thomas Jefferson, whom West brags about in his post, issued four. President Obama has issued 235 executive orders, but Reagan and George W. Bush issued over 600 combined. And if we look at the number of executive orders issued per year, we find that President Obama s average is the lowest in modern history. We have to go all the way back to Grover Cleveland to find a president with a lower average. If we go by West s logic, the only president who wasn t a tyrant was William Henry Harrison, who died one month after Inauguration Day. But even he would have likely issued some executive orders had he lived to complete a four year term.So executive orders have a precedence that goes back all the way to the first President of the United States.West also claims that the American people were taxed without their consent because of Obamacare. This is also an outright lie.By declaring our independence, Americans were able to create their own government and had the power to vote for their representatives in Congress. Americans did this very thing in 2008 when they sent a Democrat to the White House and kept Democrats in control of both chambers of Congress.The House voted in 2009 to pass Obamacare and all the taxes it contains by a vote of 219-212. The Senate voted to pass it by a vote of 60-39. And that was right after the people elected President Obama, and they would elect him again in 2012. West is likely whining because our system of checks and balances between the three branches of government, also established by the Constitution, has prevented Republicans from repealing Obamacare.It should also be pointed out that if President Obama were a tyrannical king, Allen West s head would be on a pike right now because that s what real tyrants do.It sounds like Allen West is the one who needs to brush up on his history.Featured image via Wikimedia ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Ahmed al Menhali was merely a guest visiting the U.S. and staying at a Fairfield Inn, but, true to form for the racist Islamophobes, he s obviously a terrorist, because reasons.It was apparently two people who called 911   the hotel clerk s sister and her father: The caller reported her sister told her there was a male in the lobby  in full head dress with multiple disposable phones pledging his allegiance to ISIS. Avon Police then received a second 911 call from the desk clerk s father who also requested assistance on behalf of his daughter. When police arrived, though, they found al Menhali simply speaking Arabic into one phone. Despite that, they brutally pinned him to the ground and cuffed him, according to the Council on American Islamic Relations, and police body-cam footage seems to confirm that. They were supposedly following standard protocol until they discovered that al Menhali was, in fact, totally unarmed. No bombs, no guns, no nothing.Below is the body-cam video from one of the responding officers:This is what Republicans have wrought upon society with their ongoing fear-mongering regarding Muslims and terrorism. They spout disgusting, ignorant rhetoric, and then morons like this hotel clerk, who clearly buy into everything bad they hear about Muslims, call the cops on totally innocent people.What s worse is that the right-wing pundits who spew forth this racist rhetoric would likely be fired if they said it about Jews or Christians, but noooooooooo. If they re talking about Islam, then they believe all is well. Despite efforts from some of our leaders, including George W. Bush, to try and separate the religion of Islam from terrorism, we still have people like His Royal Islamophobe, King Trump, along with Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, and others, stoking irrational, paranoid fires like they ll freeze instantly if they don t.We re also getting good at pissing countries right the hell off with this crap. The UAE was sorely disappointed that one of their citizens was treated this way for zero reason, to the point where their government called up our deputy mission chief (i.e., the Department of State) over there about the  brutal   ill-treatment meted out by the Ohio Police to an Emirati citizen.  They were apparently told that we respect the right of foreign nationals to wear clothing in accordance with their traditions and views, but it s patently obvious that we don t, all because of what if. The UAE also felt they had to send out a warning to their citizens traveling abroad: For citizens traveling outside the country, and in order to ensure their safety, we point out not to wear formal dress while traveling, especially in public places.  [emphasis mine]That sounds an awful lot like telling women to dress more modestly if they don t want to be raped. How about we actually stop teaching people that all Muslims are terrorists? One single hotel clerk from a small town managed to cause an international hassle thanks to GOP fear-mongering. At least the mayor of Avon has the city reviewing the incident to decide if the people responsible for this should face charges:Message from Mayor Jensen: pic.twitter.com/wH63Uzmhdh  City of Avon, OH (@CityofAvonOH) July 4, 2016Here s a hint for them: Yes, they absolutely should.The mayor of Avon called this incident a  miscommunication  in that apology letter. Miscommunication our lily-white asses. This was a result of the blatant racism and Islamophobia that Republicans with miniature brains, and their frightened, paranoid, xenophobic little mouthpieces, have sown here. This hotel clerk should be fired at the bare minimum, she and her family should face charges, and Republicans need to stop their racist fuckery and accept responsibility for creating an environment that leads to ordinary people in small towns creating international problems.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

After years of sitting by while Republicans waged a scorched earth campaign against Democrats, the Constitution and basic human decency, he suddenly laments the toxic level of discourse in America. Why? Because Democrats are ascendant and Republicans are teetering on total collapse. Now, he says, we should work together and it would be bad for America if we don t!Brooks sets the stage by describing how we got here. He calls it  anti-politics  and he s VERY upset about it: Over the past generation we have seen the rise of a group of people who are against politics. These groups   best exemplified by the Tea Party but not exclusive to the right   want to elect people who have no political experience. They want  outsiders.  They delegitimize compromise and deal-making. They re willing to trample the customs and rules that give legitimacy to legislative decision-making if it helps them gain power. I m guessing he s referring to Bernie Sanders  supporters as being the left-wing version because I can t think of any other group on the left that even remotely fits the description. But Bernie has been in Washington for 30 something years. He s hardly an inexperienced outsider. His followers may like his rebel cred but they don t want him to get into office for the sole purpose of bringing the government to a grinding halt. This is Brooks creating a false equivalency in order to absolve himself of his responsibility in creating antipolitics.He goes on to describe the antipolitics people as being extremists that cannot compromise and increasingly damage the process of governing. Essentially what the GOP has been doing for years while Brooks gave them ideological cover to wreck the country. Brooks is especially put off by Trump despite having enabled his rise in the first place.So far, the column is the usual right wing shifting of blame. They are patently incapable of accepting responsibility for their actions. But then we get to this, the plaintive wail for sanity: The answer to Trump is politics. It s acknowledging other people exist. It s taking pleasure in that difference and hammering out workable arrangements. As Harold Laski put it, We shall make the basis of our state consent to disagreement. Therein shall we ensure its deepest harmony.' It sure does sound reasonable but the timing of this sudden epiphany is not coincidental. You see, Republicans have spent the last 30+ years polarizing the country to the point where the two sides cannot work together. While Republicans controlled the White House, both chambers of Congress AND the Supreme Court, this was exactly what they wanted. They spent 6 years of ignoring the Democrats and doing whatever they wanted. Then they spent all of Obama s presidency breaking the system so they could stop his agenda. They became the party of antipolitics.But in November, Republicans are going to be crushed at the ballot box. Trump is going to going to lose so badly, he s going to cost Republicans the Senate by a comfortable margin, not a small number of House seats, a few governorships and control of several state legislatures. Oh, and the Supreme Court is going to tilt left for the next 30 years, which will put the final nail in the coffin of the Republican voter suppression schemes that are the only thing keeping Republicans in power in many parts of the country.So after decades of  I hate you! I hope you die! Burn in hell! Compromise is surrender! Burn it all down unless we get 100% of what we want! , we should stop playing by their rules of winner takes all? Now that they re on the edge of losing everything, Republicans want to play nice again? Noooooope, fuck that. Republicans don t get to kick sand in our faces and then demand we share our ice cream because they dropped theirs.So sorry, Mr. Brooks. You had your chance and you blew it. You sat by and let your party turn American politics into a polarized blood sport. It s not our fault you lost and we re in no mood to give you the time of day much less any concessions. We re going to put you in a little box and undo all of the damage your policies have wrought since the 80s. Unions are going to grow in strength again. The minimum wage will become a living wage. Workers will have their rights restored. Women will have their rights restored. So will minorities and the victims of the Drug War (most of whom are minorities anyway). Wall Street will still make billions but they won t be able to crash the economy again. All of your voter suppression laws will be repealed and extreme gerrymandering will end. All of this will happen without no input from you because you have painted yourselves into a corner where working with a Democrat is grounds for being primaried from the far right. It won t happen in 4 years. Or even 8. Decades of damage will take decades to clean up. But it s going to happen and there s nothing you can do to stop it.Karl Rove once boasted of a  permanent Republican majority  in which Democrats would be utterly powerless. While I m not so bold as to claim a permanent Democratic majority, Republicans will grow weaker and weaker until they can stop appealing only to white racists. In the meantime, we re gonna take it all while you, Mr. Brooks, sit and scream in impotent rage at how mean and unfair the left has become. Ha. Ha. Ha.

In November, citizens of the Golden State will decide whether or not to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes.  One of the most compelling arguments proponents of marijuana legalization have used in previous efforts to legalize marijuana in other states, is that it will bring in extra money for the state s budget.On that front, there is plenty of evidence to support that argument. Oregon saw a jaw-dropping amount of extra revenue after they legalized marijuana. Officials in Oregon expected to bring in $2 million dollars in tax revenue after their first year of legal weed. They nearly doubled their expectation bringing in an astounding $3.48 million dollars in new tax revenue.So how much is California expected to bring in should they choose to legalize recreational marijuana? Reuters reports that California could take in an additional $1 billion dollars a year: With a population of nearly 40 million people, and a thriving medical marijuana trade legalized 20 years ago, California already has the United States  largest legal marijuana market. Legalization of recreational pot would generate an estimated $1 billion in additional taxes per year. Other states that have legalized recreational marijuana have received similar tax windfalls. Colorado, the first state in the U.S. to legalize marijuana, took in $135 million dollars in taxes and fees in 2015. Colorado is pumping most of their new tax dollars into schools and other education initiatives.The state of Washington raised $67.5 million dollars in tax revenue from recreational marijuana in 2015. They are expected to raise more than $1 billion dollars over four years. This money goes into Washington s general fund and to help fund health services.Legalizing marijuana would also save California a lot of money due to no longer having to pay the enormous cost of enforcing current marijuana laws. In 2012, over 21,000 people were arrested for crimes related to marijuana criminalization. The number of overall arrests   especially felony arrests   has plummeted over the years after changes were made to the California s marijuana laws. However, the cost both budgetary and human of marijuana criminalization is still a huge financial burden for the citizens of California to bear.It s time for California, as well as the rest of the nation for that matter, to end marijuana prohibition once and for all.

Then it s a signal to slaughter as many people as possible:The spokesman for the Islamic State said in late May that jihadists should  make it, with God s permission, a month of pain for infidels everywhere.  Another extremist distributed a manual for using poisons, adding, in poor English:  Dont forget Ramadan is close, the month of victories. This is like being a Christian and going on a killing spree Christmas morning in the name of Jesus. Sure, you could rationalize it as a gift to the son of God but, really, you re going against everything the holiday stands for.And that s the point here: Radicalized Muslims are no longer really Muslims any more than the Westboro Baptist Church is really Christian. Both are cruel, twisted distortions of their respective religions. The problem is that far too many Americans, mostly, but not exclusively, right wingers, are all too eager to lump 1.6 billion Muslims together with the tens of thousands of violent lunatics that terrorize the rest of the world.Consider this: ISIS has about 25,000 fighters. That s it. Let s say that for every fighter, there are 10 people that are totally sympathetic to their cause. Hell, I ll be SUPER generous and double that. That gives us 500,000  evil  Muslim extremists. That s still just .03% of all the Muslims in the world. Yet, somehow, we re supposed to be afraid of the other 99.97% of them? We don t hold ANYONE to that kind of standard. If we did, we would have strung up every Catholic priest as a pedophile years ago or locked up every white male as a probable serial killer.But we don t, of course, because that would be insane. But we do it to Muslims anyway. The reality is that ISIS and those like them have weaponized their religion and in doing have abandoned the very religion they claim to fight in the name of. Remember, the overwhelming majority of their victims are Muslims who refuse to follow their warped interpretation of Islam:What is clearer is that the manipulation of the goals of Ramadan are another way in which jihadists have interpreted the religion in a way most Muslims deplore. Another example is the jihadists  wide use of takfir, or the branding of others as infidels who deserve death. The Islamic State has used this concept to justify the killing of other Muslims, be they Shiites or fellow Sunnis whom the group deems to be insufficiently devout.Such views course through the jihadists  Ramadan propaganda. If 90%+ of the people you kill for being infidels and heretics are of the religion to claim to represent, you re the one that is blaspheming against that religion.

From his bigotry, racism and misogynistic behavior and comments, it s hard to make the case that Trump is a man of virtue and worthy of running a country. Acclaimed documentarian Ken Burns was quick to point this out in a recent interview with the Daily Beast, where he spoke at length about how awful of a human being Trump is.Although Burns was promoting his films, the filmmaker couldn t help but get carried away when the conversation turned to race relations in the United States, and the topic of Trump came up. Burns had been talking about his film The Central Park Five, which is about five African-American teens that were wrongly convicted in the assault of a white woman in Central Park when he reminded everyone how Trump reacted to that case. He said: He shamefully took out a full-page ad in all of the New York dailies asking for a restoration of the death penalty for two 14-year-old, two 15-year-old, and one 16-year-old innocent children. While New York State laws would not have permitted their execution, just the fact that there was a rush to judgment ought to be complete evidence of how temperamentally unsuited he is for the office he now seeks. After his slam of Trump s racism, Burns went off on another anti-Trump rant, labeling Trump as a  super-predator  and going after the business mogul for being a bigot that has benefitted from the speed of social media and an  amoral internet. Burns said: I find Donald Trump more of a super-predator. This idea that he can attack and attack and attack whole groups of people, and that we live in a media culture where that s permitted to be tolerated it s the spectacle and not the truth of it. An amoral internet permits a lie to travel around the world three times before the truth can get started, and we live in a place where lying is OK where a lassitude develops where it doesn t matter what the truth is and that s how it s possible for someone like him to be advanced who is so clearly temperamentally unsuited and has no idea about governing. Then, Burns turned to the GOP and the Religious Right. Bringing up Trump s long history of sexism, misogyny and his utterly creepy obsession with his daughter Ivanka, Burns criticized Evangelicals that are somehow able to justify voting for Trump. The Republican Party has been extraordinarily successful at getting many groups of people to vote against their self-interest. Evangelicals are voting for Donald Trump. What part of Donald Trump reminds you of Jesus Christ? Trump lusts after his own daughter on national radio, talks about women s bodies and breasts in such a disparaging way, and mocks them. How is this in any way Christian? When you make the  other  the enemy, how is that Christian? There has been incident after incident, past and present, of Trump saying things about his daughter Ivanka that no father should ever say. Most notable is what Trump said in a 2006 interview where he said,  I don t think Ivanka would do that [pose for nude photographs] inside the magazine [Playboy]. Although she does have a very nice figure. I ve said that if Ivanka weren t my daughter, perhaps, I would be dating her.  There have been several other instances, and it s amazing that Burns pointed this out. If racism and bigotry weren t enough to convince America s more religious voters that Trump doesn t live the values of Christianity, his obvious sexual attraction to his own daughter should certainly raise some red flags.Featured image is a screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Even worse than this, though, are three Twitter accounts that are so deeply racist and anti-Semitic that it defies description: @cheesebrit, @FishBoneHead1, and @whitegenocideTM.King Trump has retweeted blatantly false things from these accounts, or he s retweeted horrifically racist tweets from them. The two overlap.That last one, @whitegenocideTM, is particularly frightening, not least because of his handle (he calls himself Donald Trumpowitz), but because of just how full of hatred his feed is (although you can t expect anything else from someone who has  white genocide  in his handle). He regularly hurls epithets at everyone from Jews to Muslims, along with everyone else who isn t white and Christian.@cheesedbrit is the account that tweeted these bald-faced lies posing as statistics awhile back:Trump retweeted that in apparent support of the idea that systemic racism, particularly in our justice system is something the African-American community brings on themselves. The media got all over him for that, and he shot back with this absolute crap: Am I gonna check every statistic? Well, yes, King Dunce, if you re going to put them forth as fact, you are going to check them first. But of course, he didn t.@cheesedbrit s account has since been deleted, however, pieces of it live on as screencaps, and on Twitter itself, including his profile pic, which contained a neo-Nazi symbol:For anybody who doesn t know,  goyim  is Hebrew for  non-Jew,  and  The Austrian chap with the little mustache,  of course, refers to Hitler. CheesedBrit wants another Hitler, and he believes Trump is that man.Finally, there is the jerk who put out the highly controversial anti-Semitic meme against Hillary Clinton recently. The meme showed a picture of her next to a Star of David, and said,  Most corrupt candidate in history.  Trump has since deleted the meme and replaced it with an edited one that didn t have the Star of David on it, because of course he did.That account holder @FishBoneHead1 should have changed his name to @BoneHead1, because he is, in fact, a world-class bonehead who isn t just a racist, but also a misogynist. However, that account is likewise deleted, perhaps at Twitter s behest, and perhaps because he just couldn t take the backlash he unleashed on himself with that sickening anti-Hillary, anti-Semitic meme.According to Little Bird, 28 percent of the accounts His Royal Whiteness likes to retweet follow at least one of the top 50 white supremacist groups in the country, and 62 percent follow people who use the #WhiteGenocide hashtag.

As it turns out, white supremacists are responsible for it.According to Mic: The Image was previously featured on /pol/   an Internet message board for the alt-right, a digital movement of neo-Nazis, anti-Semites, and white supremacists newly emboldened by the success of Trump s rhetoric  as early as June 22, over a week before Trump s team tweeted it. Further research led Mic directly to a Twitter account that  regularly tweets violent racist memes commenting on the state of geopolitical politics. Mic also notes that the file name of the meme on the message board could be a  nod to the Neo-Nazi code for  HH,  or  HeilHitler,  which the alt-right is fond of hiding in plain sight. So Trump and his campaign literally tweeted a meme that was created by Nazis and white supremacists. Those groups must be beaming with pride now after their leader shared their hateful work. By the time Trump removed the meme and replaced the Star of David with a circle the original meme had been shared 2,000 times.Meanwhile, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski defended the Republican nominee by calling the outrage over the meme  political correctness run amok. The bottom line is this is political correctness run amok. If this were to be a star next to Hillary Clinton without the cash behind it, no one would be questioning this,  he claimed. He also argued that it was the same star used by sheriffs.But the fact that the meme was created by neo-Nazis makes it clear that the star shape was meant to attack Jews as much as the meme was an attack on Hillary Clinton.

But now that the FBI and House Republicans have found no evidence against her, Trump has lost his two favorite attacks and he had a complete meltdown about it on Twitter on Saturday. It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton,  the Republican nominee wrote.  What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid! It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2016What Trump is referring to is Bill Clinton s brief exchange with Attorney General Loretta Lynch last week. The two were coincidentally at the Phoenix airport at the same time, so Clinton stopped by to see her since the two have known each other for a long time   going back to when he appointed her as a U.S. Attorney in 1999. According to Lynch, while it may not have been wise for the two to chat in private, the conversation was innocent and had nothing to do with the investigation. They spoke about golf and grandchildren, Lynch said. And frankly, Lynch should be given the benefit of the doubt.But you can t tell that to Trump, who also declared on Saturday night that the system is rigged because the FBI didn t charge Clinton like he wanted them to do. It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2016Basically, Donald Trump is going to have a hard time using Benghazi or the email probe against Clinton in a general election in which most people are not paranoid conservatives who see conspiracy theories everywhere they go. It will work on conservative crowds that are easy to work into a frenzy because they already hate Clinton with a murderous passion, but the Republican Benghazi report that exonerates her combined with the FBI declining to charge Clinton over emails basically gives the American people four months to forget about it because they won t care in a couple days if they ever really cared at all since this whole circus was manufactured by Republicans anyway in an effort to pin some sort of scandal on her.

The prisoners were taken to the jail s chapel so the beatings could be carried out away from the facility s surveillance cameras.Five Iberia Parish deputies, the officers who carried out the chapel beatings at the direction of Ackal, plead guilty to conspiracy and civil rights charges in February.

The bill, HB1411, was signed into law by Florida s Republican governor Rick Scott. The bill aimed to cut funding for health clinics that provide abortion services such as Planned Parenthood. If this bill had been allowed to remain law, it would have cost Planned Parenthood $500,000 dollars a year in funding.It s important to keep in mind that Florida law already prevents government funding of abortion services. That means that the relevant funding portions of the bill were not going to actually stop funding of abortion services but every other service that Planned Parenthood provides.U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle put in place a last minute injunction after Planned Parenthood affiliates challenged some of some of the provisions in the bill on conditional grounds.  The state s only beef is that the plaintiffs provide abortions,  Hinkle wrote.According to Reuters, Hinkle based his injunction on the reasoning that  clinics were unacceptably targeted by state efforts to eliminate funding for other health care services they also provide, such as birth control and screening for cancer and sexually transmitted diseases. This comes just days after the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of women s reproductive rights. The decision in Woman s Health v. Hellerstedt has had a domino effect when it comes to women s reproductive rights. Since Monday s ruling, six states have had similar abortion laws struck down either permanently or temporarily. That s a major setback to the Republican Party s war against Planned Parenthood and women s rights.It s almost laughable at this point that Republicans are trying to spin their attacks on our health care system as being an attempt to protect women, as this bill was described by its proponents.Featured image from Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Republicans have found a new way to hurt the pockets of the working class   and this time they re going so low as to strip pay away from military personnel. In June, the Republican-controlled Senate passed military budget cuts that no one asked for. Part of the budget calls for reforming how service members are compensated each month for their housing expenses.The way the current system works, service members receive a monthly stipend called the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). The amount of money service members received each month is based on several metrics such as rank, the number of dependents, and marital status. Service members are able to pocket any cash they have left over after they re housing expenses have paid for. That s all about to change.Mother Jones reports: The measure in the Senate bill, which passed with approval from the Armed Services Committee, would make the housing stipend cover only soldiers  actual bills.  Soldiers would provide copies of their rents or mortgages and get reimbursed only for what they spent, up to a maximum payable limit. Soldiers sharing housing would have their allowances divided by the number of service members sharing the space. The changes would cost many soldiers hundreds of dollars of a month. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the move would save $2 billion over the next five years. That $ 2 billion dollars in savings is just pennies compared to what has already been saved due to reforms in Tricare, the military s medical program. Todd Harrison, who works as the director of defense budget analysis for the Center for Strategic and International Studies told Mother Jones that: Just the minor changes that Congress has made to the Tricare program over the past four or five years [are] now saving more than $5 billion a year each year in the defense budget,  he says,  and I think a lot of people would be hard-pressed to identify what those changes are.  Harrison went on to add that,  They re cutting back on exactly the types of compensation that people value most. Fortunately, the changes to how the BAH runs are not included in the House s version of the spending bill. Furthermore, the Senate s version still has many legislative hurdles to jump over before it actually could be implemented.It shouldn t be too surprising that Republicans would seize the opportunity to turn the current the current need to reduce military spending into an austerity program. After all, the lower rungs of the military   those who will be impacted by this bill the most   are much more likely to be racial minorities and those with a poor working class background. It s just like the GOP to create programs that do not do much more than increase inequality in the name of fiscal responsibility.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He has not offered any proof of this, and has not given any evidence that the $10 billion figure is anything but a completely made up figment of his imagination.Now, a smoking gun document has been found that shows Trump to be far less wealthy than $10 billion, and it comes from Trump himself.In the document, which concerned the securitization of commercial mortgages on properties including Trump Tower in New York City, Trump was described as being worth more than $4.2bn, with liquid assets of more than $250m.A passage in the 132-page filing says:  The sponsor is Donald J Trump. Mr Trump has significant commercial real estate holdings worldwide including interests in office, retail, residential, golf-clubs and hospitality properties in markets including New York, San Francisco, Florida, Washington DC, and Scotland. As of 30 June 2011, Mr Trump reports a net worth in excess of $4.2bn and liquidity in excess of $250m. The document was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2012 by Wells Fargo Securities on Trump s behalf.The claim of $250 million in liquid assets is far less than the $400 million Trump told Sean Hannity of Fox News he had in a 2015 interview.The Guardian newspaper points out that that is not enough to finance a modern presidential campaign, which runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump has already loaned his campaign between $43 to $50 million dollars, which means he may already be completely tapped out despite his extravagant claim that he can self-finance a battle against Hillary Clinton to win the presidency.Trump has so far refused to disclose his tax returns to prove his net worth, the first candidate in nearly 40 years to hide his returns in this fashion. Clinton has exposed 10 years of her own returns, making her financial situation transparent.Meanwhile, Trump has been completely outgunned on fundraising. His recent filing with the Federal Elections Commission showed his campaign with less than $2 million on hand, while Clinton had over $40 million.Even worse, Clinton recently revealed that in June she had raised an additional $40 million for a war chest of over $80 million, which does not include perhaps even $100 million or more that has been raised by Super PACs supporting her campaign.Trump has not revealed his June fundraising but an email appeal from his campaign to email addresses they appear to have purchased in bulk to send spam to (several foreign government officials say they have been getting Trump emails) boasted a relatively puny $10 million figure raised in the last few weeks.The disparity is showing up in early advertising, as Clinton is spending about $500,000 a day in critical swing states   Florida, Pennsylvania, Colorado, New Mexico, and others   while Trump hasn t spent anything at all. By comparison, Mitt Romney s 2012 campaign was spending about 80% of what President Obama s re-election campaign was, keeping that candidate viable.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Yes, the state Militias that were necessary at the time because the nation didn t have a standing, nationalized army. Looking at Article 1 Section 8, it reads: To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. The Second Amendment arms those militias to be at the ready  being necessary to the security of a free State. In all honesty, the Second Amendment isn t really needed anymore now that we have our armed services. And if you think the amendment can t be removed or changed, well, you must also think alcohol is still illegal. The word amendment, quite literally, means change. Oh, and if you think that you can fight back against the government if they restrict your gun use, think again, that would be insurrection, the very thing the Second Amendment arms against, and you would be tried for treason (see also: Whiskey Rebellion).All in all, Trump is just playing into the naivety of his voting base and their love for their ever-so-precious guns.

Maher brutally mocked Johnson and his party s economic beliefs saying that  their economic theory is like Mad Max takes your gas and you die. The  Libertarian Party  would be more aptly named the  Neoliberalist Party.  They are both radically conservative on economic issues and radically liberal on social issues. As Maher described their views on government saying,  I saw your convention. The vision of government is somewhere between colonial Williamsburg and Atlantis. Both Maher and Johnson cited examples of some of the more unorthodox views some people hold within the Libertarian Party. Johnson mentioned that he was booed at the Libertarian National Convention for stating that he believes that people should be required to get a driver s license in order for them to be able to drive. Maher mentions that the question as to whether 5-year-olds should be able to purchase heroin legally is a major debate between libertarians.As nutty as that sounds, Johnson insists that here are extremists and loons in every party, while posturing himself as an alternative to people who might be voting for the presumptive Republican nominee this November. Johnson insists that he is the best non-major party candidate to take votes away from Trump due to his predicted status of being on the ballot in all fifty states in the 2016 general election.The left has fervently hoped that a serious non-major candidate would run against Trump in the general election. With Republicans begrudgingly beginning to rally around Trump, it is looking more unlikely that either a serious or protest candidate backing a moderately conservative agenda will come from the Republican Party.Whether Johnson can run a serious campaign in November will mostly be determined by whether he can make his way into the debates. Candidates must be polling at 15% in order to make it into the debates. Johnson is currently polling at 10%. It s unlikely that Johnson is going to reach the necessary threshold to join the debates. That being said, he does seem like a reasonable choice for conservatives who cannot hold their nose to vote for Hillary Clinton and are adamantly a part of the #NeverTrump camp.You can watch the interview below, in full.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rK3IDl8RY8Featured image from video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And in Issue No. 1 of Steve Rogers: Captain America, there was a character named Red Skull that gave a hateful anti-immigration speech that could have been taken directly from one of Trump s speeches. Calling for a race war, Red Skull said: I have just come from Europe my homeland, in fact. And do you know what I saw there? It was an invading army. These so-called  refugees    millions of them   marching across the continent, bringing their fanatical beliefs and their crime with them. They attack our women, and bomb our cities. And how do our leaders respond? Do they push them back and enforce the borders, as is our sovereign duty? Of course not. They say,  Here, take our food. Take our shelter. Take our way of life, and then take our lives.  Despicable. Trump as a villain was clearly meant to be.Featured image via screenshots""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This one is for you.After reading a pair of anti-abortion letters written by men published in the Minneapolis Star Tribune in response to the Supreme Court striking down Texas s draconian abortion law, Heidi Seltz couldn t stand to sit back and take the bullshit any longer.Texas law had forced abortion clinic doctors to obtain admitting privileges at an area hospital in order to continue providing reproductive services to patients. It also required clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers or they would be forced to shut down. Both requirements shuttered many clinics that women rely on for care and would have closed many more had the Supreme Court not ruled 5-3 against the law.Apparently, some men in Minnesota were very angry that the high court blocked their ability to tell women what they can and cannot do with their bodies and they publicly whined to the newspaper about it.So Heidi felt she should respond so that women are represented among the opinions published. And she only needed a few sentences to rip them a new one and put them in their place. It would be nice if men would shut up and if editors would help them,  she wrote. Unless you have a woman s body, I don t want to hear your opinion on what women s bodies should or should not do. In fact, it would be a delight if the Star Tribune Editorial Board ceased publishing men s letters about women s bodies entirely. Perhaps newspaper readership among young people would grow if every time we opened a paper, we didn t have to read old men s fusty opinions about uteri. Here s the letter via Twitter.Heidi is sick of your bullshit. pic.twitter.com/7TGEz5Q3TD  Stacey Burns (@WentRogue) June 30, 2016More women like Heidi Seltz must speak up in this way so that men do not dominate the conversation on reproductive rights. For too long, men have spearheaded the movement to restrict the reproductive rights of women to the detriment of women s health and freedom. The men in this movement are mostly conservatives who want to control women s bodies and make them submit to their will. That s why whenever Republicans in Congress form a committee to whine about abortion and contraceptives it s very noticeable that they rarely include a woman on the panel. Usually it s old white men who think they know everything about women s bodies and how they work. That has to change and it will only change if women stand up for themselves and demand it.Featured image via Twitter ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And one person he has never seen at a memorial is Donald Trump, who has exploited 9/11 repeatedly for political gain throughout his bid to become the Republican Party nominee.And his effort paid off because conservatives across the country bought the bullshit Trump was selling them.As the Daily Beast points out, Trump s biggest claim about 9/11 is that  thousands  of American Muslims were seen celebrating and cheering as the attacks unfolded. However, that claim has been thoroughly debunked. But Trump s supporters don t care, and they still believe Trump rather than acknowledge the actual facts.Trump has also claimed that he personally witnessed people jumping to their deaths from the towers even though he was four miles away at the time. Trump did all this despite referring to the Twin Towers as  not great  buildings a week after 9/11, making zero donations to 9/11 charities as of 2015, and visiting the 9/11 Memorial for the very first time to curry favor on the eve of the New York presidential primary, four and a half years after it was erected,  the Daily Beast reports.Trump has used fear and bigotry throughout his campaign to cast Muslims as an evil group hell-bent on destroying America and 9/11 is a central talking-point in that effort. For the most part, Trump has succeeded by appealing to the hate and racism of conservatives who have flocked to his campaign out of the belief that Muslims are a threat to the United States and that only Trump can prevent our destruction. And that makes Denis Leary sick, so he wasted no time in ripping Trump to pieces during a recent interview. I think he ll basically do anything to get the spotlight,  Leary told the Daily Beast. Trump will take advantage of whatever the situation, the cause, or the event might be. Where was he before this?

What the fuck is going on? Donald Trump is the candidate in this presidential race who represents fear and hate. He also represents a right-wing that ignores facts. Trump doesn t care about anything that made this country great. He only cares about himself and power he can wield if he somehow becomes president in November. That cannot be allowed to happen. We cannot allow Trump to use the deaths of 3,000 people to propel himself to the White House.

He s also banned individual reporters from his rallies who work for a much larger range of outlets. They all seem to have a bad habit of making him look bad and, well, King Trump just can t have that.Trump is so sensitive to anyone that doesn t bow and scrape before his dirty little feet that he promised to open up libel laws so it s easier to sue the press and  win lots of money.  In other words, censorship. It s a wonder that Tea Partiers, who allegedly want a return to running the country according to the letter of the Constitution, actually support him given how he s openly threatened to tear up the First Amendment (and others, too).Trump also has a history of filing Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, which is suing someone for exercising their First Amendment rights. It s ridiculously clear that he uses lawsuits as a weapon and a negotiating tool, and he also makes a point of suing anyone he doesn t like. As the GOP s standard-bearer, it s patently obvious that they re kowtowing to him.Open Secrets was allegedly barred because of space constraints.

FactCheck.org was initially denied credentials as well, but they got an appeal and succeeded, so what the hell?RNC communications director Kevin Spicer said that the credentialing process goes through the House and Senate press galleries.

And there s a whole host of delegates who won t be in attendance either.Of course, there is a very slim chance that the RNC is telling the truth about space and credentialing and Trump actually had nothing to do with this.Pathetically slim.So slim that it s virtually nonexistent.It s just way too coincidental that they d do this to an outlet that s attended their convention every year since 1996 while preparing to crown the very man that has openly said he wants to censor the press.

After realizing that national abortion laws are a no-go, especially with a Democratic president, conservatives have attempted to use their control of state governments in order to roll back women s rights.But the recent 5-3 Supreme Court decision in the case of Whole Woman s Health v. Hellerstedt found that many of the roadblocks erected by the religious right through the Republican Party have put an  undue burden  on women seeking abortion services, and have to be struck down.As a result, there is a wave of anti-choice legislation being undone.Since Monday, laws restricting abortion and non-abortion Planned Parenthood funding have already been temporarily or permanently wiped out in six states. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed a new case Friday challenging a whopping seven of Louisiana s new abortion restrictions. And on the heels of Whole Woman s Health, Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced an effort to pursue repealing laws in eight states through legislatures. (Even lawmakers hostile to abortion may prefer the less expensive option of repealing a law, rather than having to defend one that is unlikely to stand after the Supreme Court s decision.)Now, Republican lawmakers who had planned more abortion restrictions are being forced to put their plans on ice or give up on them completely. They no longer have a blank check for their attacks on women s rights.And the right has a problem nationally. While polls show voters believe in some restrictions on choice, most Americans believe that a woman has a right to abortion services. The support is even higher among women, and Republicans have ceased to be a majority in presidential elections largely thanks to votes from women. It is a losing case for them to be so opposed to abortion rights.In this year s election, Hillary Clinton has already been hammering Donald Trump on choice. Clinton of course supports abortion rights, while since the campaign began Trump has argued in favor of  punishment  for women who get abortions once they are outlawed (as the Republican Party platform calls for).The current Supreme Court vacancy will be key to future battles over abortion, as will vacancies that are likely to open up over the next four years, in large part due to the advanced age of several of the justices, including liberal stalwart Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

On Friday, California s governor, Jerry Brown, signed six bills into law that would make it harder for the wrong people to get guns.The bills would require background checks to buy ammunition and the purchase would be registered with the California Department of Justice. The term  assault rifle  will be broadened to include more guns, as assault rifles can only be loaned to family and magazines will be limited to 10 rounds or fewer. My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners,  Brown said in a statement.Source: USA TodayBrown also vetoed some bills, including one that would make stealing a gun grand theft. That, Brown said,  proposes to add an initiative that is nearly identical to one which will already appear on the November 2016 ballot. He also vetoed a bill that expanded the definition of  firearm  to include the homemade kind. It also would have limited purchases of guns to one a month.  While well-intentioned, I believe this bill would have the effect of burdening lawful citizens who wish to sell certain firearms that they no longer need.  said Brown.The third vetoed bill would have allowed employers, coworkers, metal health workers and school workers to get restraining orders against gun violence. Currently, restraining orders are only available to family members when it comes to gun violence.The fourth would require gun theft victims to report to law enforcement within five days.  I continue to believe that responsible people report the loss or theft of a firearm and irresponsible do not,  Brown said.  It is not likely that this bill would change that. California currently has some of the toughest gun control laws in the nation. They work. The last time California passed major gun laws was in the early 1990s and the result has been dramatic.Gun violence across California dropped 56% from 5,500 gun deaths in 1993 to 2,935 in 2010, according to the study, which took into account California s expanded population from about 30 to 37 million people over the same period.Among all 50 states, California has perhaps the strongest gun control laws.  California is at the very top end of firearms regulation,  legal expert Bryan L. Ciyou and author of  Gun Laws By State  told msnbc.The current laws include a ban on military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. There are also laws empowering law enforcement and adding safety requirements to handguns.

You re going to have kiosks that are going to be able to sell things to people,  she continued. This we ve learned from Seattle, and some other cities that have already implemented it, that jobs are lost. That this, it s   the burden is put on the back of other struggling people. You will fire individuals in order to maintain that the salary requirement of the others that you have there. And others, of course, are putting   fast-food places are putting in robotics, and kiosks, so you can order your own food. This is what s going to happen. In fact, the Seattle minimum wage increase has not caused the sky to fall as Bruce and her Fox colleagues have been claiming since it was first passed. Many workers are bringing home more money to pay bills and take care of their families. Prices for products have not shot up as conservatives warned and it s still too early to tell if the wage increase is slowing job growth.Varney then turned to WWE has-been John Layfield, who makes a living being a loudmouth on television. Layfield spoke from the nation of Bermuda, and giddily explained that Bermuda does not have a minimum wage and that children work for tips.LAYFIELD: There actually isn t a minimum wage here, right now. You see some of these young kids   I run a program for at-risk kids   down, sacking groceries, about age 12, and they work off tips. So there isn t actually a minimum wage here.BRUCE: That s how it used to be.LAYFIELD: And it actually works fine. The problem I have with this $15 minimum wage is why 15, because it looks good on a bumper sticker? You re not talking about fixing anything. Tie it to inflation, or a basket of wages, so you take it out of politics and union hands. That s all it is.Except that it s really not working fine. As it turns out, there is a significant income gap in Bermuda and poverty affects many locals because unskilled workers from overseas are willing to work for very little which means great wealth for those who don t have to pay their workers very much because there is no minimum wage law. And children are forced to help out by working for nothing more than the hope of a decent tip.But Varney continnued to whine about the wage increases here in the states because people in poverty will now be able to bring in $30,000 a year. Panelist Elizabeth McDonald complained because she thinks anyone in an  entry-level job  should be in poverty, even if they have a family to support. She even claimed that college tuition will go up because young workers are making more.VARNEY: $15 an hour, for a forty hour week, is $30,000 a year. I mean, what  ELIZABETH MACDONALD: It s supposed to be an entry-level job, it s not supposed to be a career. And, by the way, AWOL in this debate   when you have things in the [Obama] administration like raising overtime pay depending on the skill set, and minimum wages, watch out college tuition goes up.VARNEY: That s right, because of all those people who work minimum wage in the colleges. You ve got that right.Of course, college prices were going up long before the minimum wage increase came into being. But don t tell that to Fox Business. The truth will hurt their feelings, if they have any.Here s the video via Media Matters.The bottom line is that increasing the minimum wage is not only fair it helps the economy in general.Every year, corporate fat cats receive salary increases of millions of dollars while the workers who make the business successful see their wages stagnate. This forces many workers to apply for federal aid to make ends meet. Raising the wage helps workers take care of their families and makes it unnecessary for a lot of them to apply for aid. It also helps boost the local economy because workers will use their increased earnings to buy goods, thus pumping more dollars into area businesses that will use those extra profits to pay their own workers a higher wage and hire extra workers if there is more demand.In other words, Fox hosts are fearmongering again and if they had their way, Americans would work for pennies and children would work for even less.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They re masterpieces of propaganda with the agenda scheduled down to the minute.But that was before Donald Trump.With just a few days left before the big weekend, no one knows who is speaking, who is attending or, seriously, how much time Trump himself will spend at his own nomination:Much of the program remains in flux, including who will speak, how and when Mr. Trump will arrive, and what he will say when he does.And after months of promising that his convention would be special, and not  boring  like previous ones, Mr. Trump says he is now embracing a less-is-more approach.One thing there will be less of, which might come as a surprise to anyone expecting all the brashness and ubiquity of Trump branding, is the candidate himself.Trump is refusing to speak all three days of the convention. You know, HIS convention. Apparently he just can t be bothered. He s worried people will think he s  grandstanding.  Because Donald trump is all about moderation and humility. Said no one ever.But part of the problem, OK, MOST of the problem, is Trump himself. No one wants to be seen endorsing him and Trump literally has no idea what the hell he is doing:At one point, two aides confirmed, Mr. Trump was not even aware that the event had to be held in Cleveland, a decision made almost two years ago by the Republican National Committee.That s the kind of statement that drives Republican operatives to straight up alcoholism. Or suicide. Or both.Very few prominent Republicans have agreed to take the stage to support Trump and Trump, being the pettiest of men, has declared that he will try to block people like Ted Cruz and John Kasich from speaking unless they bend the knee to him, a most unlikely occurance.Trump is still promising to have big celebrity names at his coronation in lieu of big political names but he s become so toxic, it s hard to imagine anyone who is not already deeply ensconced in right wing culture showing up. Ted Nugent would happily get on stage to shout about guns and Muslims but his appeal is limited to inbred yokels and ammosexuals.On top of all of this, Trump still doesn t have much in the way of a campaign organization. He s just winging it and assuming his sheer awesomeness will win the day. But at this rate, his campaign, already on life support from his numerous gaffes, scandals and general idiocy, will be DOA out of the starting gate and it s not clear that Trump would be able to recover from the impending disaster his debut is shaping up to be.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

That being said, there is still a large number of Republicans out there taking the #NeverTrump pledge.GOP Senator Mike Lee from Utah still has not endorsed Trump. In fact, he is speaking out against him. So much so that he recently launched an attack ad against the presumptive nominee. He has also spoken out against Trump during media interviews. In one recent interview with Newsmax, Lee laid out a small list of grievances against Trump.During the interview, Lee brought up the time that Trump accused Ted Cruz s father (Lee and Cruz are BFF s) conspiring to kill John F. Kennedy, exasperatingly telling Newsmax,  He said that. He actually said that.  The exchange came after the host kept insisting that Lee should endorse Trump: Well, we can get into that if you want. I mean we can get into the fact that he accused my best friend s father of conspiring to kill JFK,  Lee said.  We can go through the fact that he has made some statements that some have identified correctly as religiously intolerance. We can get into the fact that he is so unpopular because my sate consists of members who were a religious minority church   a people who were ordered exterminated by the governor of Missouri in 1839   and statements like that make them nervous. Now look, these things are not something that I couldn t get over if I heard the right things out of him. But if you want to go to why I have concerns, I can go on if you like. I hope I can get over these concerns. I hope Mr. Trump can help me identify them. But don t sit here and tell me Steve that I have no reason to be concerned about Donald Trump. Trump has made a lot of enemies in the Republican Party during his primary campaign run. Trump will not only have to fight off presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, but also the left of lite-fascist members of the Republican Party.

So it s more than just a little crazy that Republican Governor Pat McCrory announced that he would be robbing his state s own disaster relief fund to pay for the defense of his illegal trans bathroom bill.Led by McCrory, state Republicans have diverted half a million dollars from the state s  Emergency Response and Disaster Relief  fund and say they will use it to hire lawyers to fight tooth-and-nail against the federal government which has deemed the anti-trans bill known as HB2 unconstitutional. Considering how obvious it is that this violates the Civil Rights Act, the money will serve only to delay the inevitable for as long as possible.The law has already cost the state tens of millions of dollars in lost business, boycotts, and bad press. Adding the $500,000 is only going to make things worse. This is particularly dire because the fight against the Zika virus continues to go unfunded at the federal level. A recent bill proposed by Republicans to give some of the funds was shot down by Democrats after they insisted on including an amendment to defund Obamacare. The premise, to take away millions of Americans health insurance during the outbreak of a potential health epidemic was, to put it lightly, repugnant on every level.So rather than get serious at a state level, North Carolina decided to defund itself. It will now head into the eye of the Zika storm with a pitiable amount of money to combat it.

The statistics are mind-blowing. After all, those in the top one percent make 184 times those in the bottom 90 percent. Yes, it s that bad, but for the first time in 17 years, the bottom 90 percent have seen some gains. Unfortunately, the top 1 percent have seen more gains.The top 1 percent income earners in the United States hit a new high last year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The bottom 99 percent of income earners registered the best real income growth (after factoring in inflation) in 17 years, but the top one percent did even better. The latest IRS data show that incomes for the bottom 99 percent of families grew by 3.9 percent over 2014 levels, the best annual growth rate since 1998, but incomes for those families in the top 1 percent of earners grew even faster, by 7.7 percent, over the same period.Source: Equitable GrowthThat might sound like a mixed bag, and it certainly is, but it does mark the first time since the Clinton administration where those who are struggling have seen real growth. Since the beginning of the 2009 recession, those below the top 10 percent have been seeing anemic 1.1 percent growth.While this news is pretty good, it s not great. To this day, the non-wealthy have only recovered 60 percent of lost wealth from the Great Recession. Things have been much, much better for those at the top:Income inequality in the United States persists at extremely high levels, particularly at the very top of the income ladder. Figure 1 shows that the incomes (adjusted for inflation) of the top 1 percent of families grew from $990,000 in 2009 to $1,360,000 in 2015, a growth of 37 percent. In contrast, the incomes of the bottom 99 percent of families grew only by 7.6 percent from $45,300 in 2009 to $48,800 in 2015. As a result, the top 1 percent of families captured 52 percent of total real income growth per family from 2009 to 2015 while the bottom 99 percent of families got only 48 percent of total real income growth. This uneven recovery is unfortunately on par with a long-term widening of inequality since 1980, when the top 1 percent of families began to capture a disproportionate share of economic growth.With Sanders all but out of the race, our attentions have to turn to what Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump might do to correct the problem.Trump plans very little, other than tax breaks for people making less than $25,000 a year. That does little to solve income inequality, but it could take enough money from the IRS that Republicans could claim that we, as taxpayers, can no longer afford food stamps or health care supplements.Clinton s plan is to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour, middle class green job creation, small business incentives, college assistance and tax assistance.Of course, don t look for any real improvements in income inequality until the Supreme Court rules that corporations are no longer people. Donald Trump is not going to give us that Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton vows that she will.Featured image via Alex Wong at Getty Images.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Trey Gowdy, who was supposed to be the only one who could successfully investigate Benghazi (because the other zillion investigations likewise turned up nothing and Republicans weren t satisfied with that). Trey Gowdy, who was supposed to be able to turn the heat up so high on Hillary and everyone else that they d crack under the strain and spill everything.Trey Gowdy, who is now disgraced in the eyes of Republicans and Democrats alike, albeit for very different reasons.Michael Savage, a far-right wing radio host that pushes conspiracy nonsense, actually said: Trey Gowdy should be impeached for wasting my time! He promised us a lot! Remember? He totally forgot the fact that members of Congress can t be impeached, they can just be kicked out entirely. That little tidbit aside, it was the House that voted for a new investigation and put Gowdy in charge. Shouldn t they all be thrown out now for wasting two years and millions of taxpayer dollars? Not to side with Gowdy here, but he hardly acted alone.The Citizens  Commission on Benghazi, which is made up primarily of right-wing douchecanoes looking for anything they can find to topple Hillary, is likewise angry with Gowdy. During a meeting, retired Admiral James Lyons said: Chairman Gowdy is not a stenographer. . . . He was there to make findings and conclusions. He had the information. He copped out, which is consistent that we ve seen with all our congressional leadership. Retired General Thomas McInerney is likewise wheeling around on Gowdy: [T]he American people want to know from a group that spent almost two years on it what the conclusions are. That s what we pay you for, Mr. Gowdy. But perhaps the silliest, most ridiculous moment came when a woman from the crowd at that meeting asked a truly out-there question: Has someone in the GOP leadership gotten their fingers involved in watering down some of this to benefit Secretary Clinton? Because she can t possibly be innocent. They know things. Nobody on this commission argued that question.In fact, that less-than-reputable group has put together its own report  full of inventive accusations,  as the Washington Post s Dana Milbank put it. This report claims to know that Obama and Hillary both are in bed with al Qaeda, that the U.S. government submitted to Islamic law on slander, and that the Obama administration switched sides in the War on Terror.And since Gowdy couldn t deliver what they wanted in an official report, he s now solely to blame for the failure of what was supposed to be the investigation that would finally prove Hillary guilty. This is absolutely hilarious.Gowdy s career will probably end in disgrace. It s hard to feel sorry for him, though.

Clearly, Trump overpaid for the item.The auction was in support of the Susan G. Komen Foundation, which suffered a serious backlash the same year when it tried to take funding away from Planned Parenthood in protest of abortion, thus depriving women of breast cancer screenings that the money paid for. The ensuing outrage forced the Komen organization to reinstate the funding.The Koman Foundation lost a lot of support over the scandal but Donald Trump pumped $12,000 into the organization for a worthless helmet. There normally wouldn t be a problem with that. After all people can spend their money on anything they want. But Trump didn t personally pay for the helmet himself. Instead, he took funds out of his own charity to pay for it.That s right. Trump did not pay for the item with a single dime of his own personal fortune. He used money donated by other people to his Donald Trump Foundation to make the purchase.Well, the Washington Post consulted some tax experts to find out if Trump broke the law and this is what they had to say: That would be a classic violation of the prohibition on a charity being operated for the private inurement (benefit) of the charity s creator,  wrote Brett G. Kappel, an expert on tax-exempt organizations at the Akerman law firm in Washington. The Trump Foundation does not appear to have offices of its own. It is headquartered at Trump s business offices in New York and has no full-time staff.The best case for Trump, experts said, would be if he had given the helmet and jersey away to another charity, perhaps to be auctioned off at another fundraiser. If   the foundation paid for it, and they owned the helmet, and the helmet was given to someone as a charitable activity,  that would be enough, said John Edie, now retired, who was the longtime general counsel at the Council on Foundations.Edie said Trump could not get off the hook by simply giving the memorabilia to a friend. Spending $12,000 for a helmet and then giving it to a golfing buddy is not  charity, Edie said.In short, Trump is clearly hiding his tax returns for a reason or multiple reasons that could seriously damage his already sinking campaign. And by the way, the man who claims to be great at making deals clearly failed to see the bad deal he was making when he bought a football helmet signed by a guy who couldn t hack it in the NFL. The Washington Post reports that Trump s $12,000 memorabilia is now only worth just over $400 today. And if you ask me, that price is still too high.Featured Image: Ralph Freso/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Minutes later, Ronnie Shumpert, a 37-year-old Black father of five, was brutalized, maimed and tortured by that officer. Then he was shot dead.It was 9:38 pm when officer Cook pulled over the vehicle Shumpert was driving. The car belonged to his friend, Charles Foster. Foster was with Shumpert in the car. He witnessed much of what happened that night.Shumpert had a felony warrant for his arrest, yet there s no way the officer could have known that at the time of the traffic stop. He was never ID d. The car he was driving was not registered in his name. To officer Cook, he was just another Black man behind the wheel of a car.As soon as Cook pulled the car over Shumpert ran. Officer Cook pursued him with a police canine.According to witnesses, Shumpert was hiding underneath a house when Cook found him.Police say he immediately attacked the officer and the dog. Witnesses say otherwise. Foster and others say Shumpert immediately tried to surrender, but Cook turned the dog loose on the unarmed man. It attacked his groin, ripping off his testicles.Autopsy photos show that there were deep gashes across his body. Several of Shumpert s teeth were knocked out, others were shoved into his gums.By this time Ronnie Shumpert was likely bleeding out from a gash so large  you could fit a baseball in it.  His testicles had been shredded by a vicious attack dog and he was suffering from devastating facial wounds. Yet Cook claims that the unarmed father was still a threat. That s why he had to execute him.According to Foster, less than five minutes passed before officer Cook shot Shumpert dead. He fired four shots. Three bullets ripped through Ronnie Shumpert s chest. A fourth bullet entered his stomach.Police say it was ten minutes before an ambulance was called. The nearest hospital was less than a minute away. Video from the night of the lynching shows an ambulance arriving one hour after Cook fired his weapon.Officer Cook has had excessive force complaints filed against him before. The most recent complaint was filed less than two months ago.According to Tupelo s white city attorney, Ben Logan, any accusations of racial profiling, police brutality and corruption in connection with the death of Ronnie Shumpert are  just ridiculous. During a press conference held on June 27, Logan showed no concern over the nature and extent of Shumpert s injuries. Instead, he accused the dead man s family of being  instigators,  claiming that their cries for justice are  endangering the peace of the community. Rather than being upset over the brutal torture and unjustifiable death of an unarmed Tupelo resident, Logan went on to stress that he is  upset  about statements made by the Shumpert family attorney, Carlos Moore, saying they shine a  bad light  on attorneys.Moore is calling on the Department of Justice to investigate the death of Ronnie Shumpert, as well as the  entire Tupelo police department.  The family is demanding that officer Cook be immediately terminated from the police force. They also want the canine that bit off Ronnie Shumpert s testicles retired immediately.Shumpert s family is also seeking answers from the police department. Some of the questions are about officer Cook s history and length of time on the force. They also want to know why the first ambulance arrived on the scene an hour after Ronnie Shumpert was shot.Aside from these demands, Moore is calling for the establishment of an independent citizen s review board to oversee accusations of police brutality and excessive force in Tupelo.Tupelo police are not equipped with body cameras. That s not acceptable in 2016.As reported by the Atlanta Black Star, New York Daily News and other media outlets, this was a modern day lynching. Out of sight of cameras, Officer Cook allowed his canine to mutilate Ronnie Shumpert in the most brutal way possible.Witness testimony shows that Shumpert was trying to surrender when Officer Cook and the canine attacked him. Autopsy photos demonstrate that after being brutalized by Cook and his attack dog, he was defenseless at the time the officer opened fire on him.Moore, accompanied by Ronnie Shumpert s family, held a press conference on June 27.Here s video from both the Shumpert family s press conference and the press conference held by Tupelo city attorney, Ben Logan, courtesy of Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal on YouTube.

Ted Cruz, he finally had enough. As Cruz checked the boxes off on his Islamophobia checklist, he wound up asking the same stupid question repeatedly to DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson: Why is the White House refusing to use the term  radical Islam? As national security issues go, this one is somewhere around the bottom of the priority list. As has been repeatedly pointed out by military and foreign policy experts, the term  radical Islam  doesn t do a single thing to stop terrorism, while at the same time playing directly into the hands of terrorist groups like ISIS. As a rule, presidents don t like to engage in that terminology precisely because it works to undermine the fight against global terrorism. Ted Cruz might even dimly recall how the last Republican president, George W. Bush, also didn t like to lump all Muslims into the category of  terrorists.  Even he understood that it was self-defeating. Americans understand we fight not a religion,  [George Bush] said.  Ours is not a campaign against the Muslim faith. Ours is a campaign against evil. Although [Bush and Obama] have taken very different approaches to combating terrorism, it s strikingly hard to tell the difference between their statements on the divide between the majority of those who practice Islam and those who invoke the faith to carry out violence. There are thousands of Muslims who proudly call themselves Americans, and they know what I know   that the Muslim faith is based upon peace and love and compassion,  Bush once said.Americans might understand that, but Ted Cruz apparently didn t.At the hearing, Cruz demanded to know if President Obama or anyone else in the White House had intentionally removed  references to radical Islamic terrorism.  After several times rebuking Cruz, Johnson finally snapped. Senator, I find this whole debate to be very interesting, but I have to tell you, when I was at the Department of Defense giving the legal sign off on a lot of drone strikes I didn t particularly care if the baseball card said  Islamic extremist  or  violent extremist . I think this is very interesting, but it makes no difference to me in terms of who we need to go after. And who is determined to attack our homeland. As Secretary Johnson reminded Cruz, the war against groups like ISIS won t be won by semantics. The airstrikes are real. The fighting on the ground (often times most heavily supported by Muslim nations) is real. The words a blustering Ted Cruz wants to use aren t. But Johnson wasn t down twisting the knife. The other point I d like to make is that I have to think in practical terms in Homeland Security. I think this is all very interesting, makes for good political debate, but in practical terms, if we in our efforts here in the homeland start giving the Islamic State the credence that they want   to be referred to as part of Islam or some form of Islam   we will get nowhere in our efforts to build bridges with Muslim communities.

He went on to say: He was just babbling about how God is coming for everyone and he has to get the evil out of the daughter. He kept coming every time I moved between him and the baby. He d charge me and I d swing the bat. Police arrived on the scene after someone called 911 to report a disturbance involving a man with a bat.According to Sgt. Fred Nieman of the Clark County Sheriff s Office, Holder was  out of control.  Officers tased him before taking him into custody.Holder was taken to a nearby hospital by ambulance. On the way to the hospital he reportedly said: I did not want to kill her, but I had to I knew I had to crush her head. He made a similar comment at the hospital, saying: I had to hold my daughter and crush her head so she could go up to the sky. According to the child s mother, she and the girl were sleeping in the hotel room when Holder rushed in and began the attack.

This afternoon, Trump made yet another racist joke about Mexicans, and it s just as disrespectful and disgusting as his comments about Mexican immigrants being  rapists  and  drug dealers. At his rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump made a truly distasteful joke when his speech was momentarily interrupted by a plane flying overhead. Trump had just been gushing about how Mexico s leaders were  so much smarter  than America s (clearly taking a swipe at President Barack Obama) when he was suddenly inspired by the plane. He began: I respect Mexico, and I respect their leaders. What they ve done to us is incredible. Their leaders are so much smarter, so much sharper, and it s incredible. As the plane went by, Trump pointed up at the plane and joked: In fact, that could be a Mexican plane up there, they re getting ready to attack. Barely anyone laughed and Trump got on with his speech, having completed his task of assuring America that he will always be a bigot, no matter how much backlash he receives for it.You can watch Trump reignite his love for racism and xenophobia in the video below, via NBC News:Video: Trump sees a plane overhead, says  That could be a Mexican plane up there they re getting ready to attack.  https://t.co/ryWXqnrMgx  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) June 30, 2016One thing is for sure   if Trump becomes President of the United States, the leaders of Mexico that Trump has praised so much won t be returning the favor.

The $45 million worth of debt the campaign has is apparently personal loans he made, and he can convert them to donations, effectively wiping out the campaign s debt.He d have to file paperwork with the FEC, though, and so far, that hasn t happened. NBC wasn t able to get much out of his campaign about this, with spokesperson Hope Hicks saying they re going to file it with the next scheduled FEC report. She had originally said that they were going to file it last week.Until that paperwork is filed, though, this is another way for him to line his pockets with pieces of silver. While that loan is still a loan, he can use new campaign donations to reimburse himself. The law gives him until August to do this, so he can milk this for all it s worth and nobody can do a thing about it.Trumplestiltskin is such an upstanding candidate.GOP donors are squirrelly about this because they want assurances that their money isn t going into Trump s personal coffers. The problem is, until he files that paperwork, there can t be any assurances, and His Royal Crookedness will find other ways of funneling those donations to his not-inconsiderable bank accounts anyway.Earlier this week, USA Today, which seems to have made it their mission to scrutinize every single thing Trump does, reported that just two percent of the GOP donors that supported Mitt Romney four years ago have contributed to Trump in any way. Some blame his late start in courting GOP donors, but the truth is, many of them are just too hesitant to give money to him.All he has to do is file a signed statement and reflect the change in accounting on his next filing. It s not like it s that hard. Trump s campaign said that this was a done deal and yet, it isn t. Why wouldn t they just tell the truth from the get-go, and say that they ll do it with the next monthly filing, instead of a special statement?

He often listened in on staff calls, but he could also listen in on guest calls, although the GOP frontrunner s spokeswoman denies it.According to Buzzfeed, who spoke to six former employees, four of whom spoke under the condition of anonymity because of non-disclosure agreements, this is indeed true. Those four said he listened in, from the private room he keeps, during the mid-2000s.They said he listened in on calls between club employees or, in some cases, between staff and guests. None of them knew of Trump eavesdropping on guests or members talking on private calls with people who were not employees of Mar-a-Lago. They also said that Trump could eavesdrop only on calls made on the club s landlines and not on calls made from guests  cell phones.Each of these four sources said they personally saw the telephone console, which some referred to as a switchboard, in Trump s bedroom.None of the four supports Trump s bid for president. All said they enjoyed their time working at Mar-a-Lago.The two other employees did not wish to remain anonymous. They are Trump s former butler (the one who wants Obama killed) and Trump s former security director, both of whom support Trump s run for president, said that the console was only to make phone calls.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, is running at a time when Americans are increasingly concerned about surveillance   both by the government and by their employers. Some of his own campaign staff feared that their offices in Trump Tower in New York might be bugged, the New York Times reported last month. Trump has backed the NSA s bulk collection of metadata, telling conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that  I tend to err on the side of security.  Trump added,  I assume when I pick up my telephone people are listening to my conversations anyway, if you want to know the truth. If Trump was listening in on guests  calls, that was certainly a violation of Florida law. The law is less clear on calls involving employees, but since both parties in Florida need to be notified, if the second party is not an employee, that is legally murky at best.This accusation is frightening. I have always been of the opinion that Trump is running for the job of dictator, hence his admiration of Putin and Kim Jong Un. This does not bode well.

We see ourselves in each other and our lives are richer for it. The enduring partnership between Canada and the United States is as strong as it has ever been and we are more closely aligned than ever before. And President Obama felt more adulation and love within the Canadian Parliament than he has ever felt from the hostile Republicans who control Congress.Throughout his remarks, President Obama received multiple standing ovations and several chants of  four more years  even though he is restricted to two terms by the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution.It s the kind of treatment of the Commander-in-Chief that Republicans have refused to do themselves over the last eight years because of their open racism and hatred.Indeed, Republicans have never treated President Obama with the respect and dignity the office deserves.That was never more clear than in 2009 when South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson screamed  You lie!  at President Obama in the middle of the State of the Union Address.It was a disgraceful moment in the history of Congress and in the history of the Republican Party.And while Canadian lawmakers would love to see President Obama serve another term in the White House, conservatives are paranoid to the point of stocking up on weapons just in case he somehow manages to circumvent the Constitution. Hell, Republicans even refuse to acknowledge that President Obama is still the leader of this country for another six months. They were already calling him a lame duck president in February when they refused to hold confirmation hearings for anyone Obama nominates to replace deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. It s like they believe a presidency ends after seven years instead of eight.Beyond that disrespectful treatment, President Obama has had to put up with unprecedented obstruction and racism from the GOP, not to mention endless investigations in an effort to find any kind of scandal they can make stick so they can discredit him. In addition, Republicans have called him an arrogant tyrant and just about every name in the book.You will never see Republicans in Congress treat President Obama with respect and admiration.But the Canadian Parliament did just that on Wednesday to show Americans how this president should be treated.Here s the video via Twitter.They are shouting  four more years!  pic.twitter.com/Geg2NXWYfF  Roberta Rampton (@robertarampton) June 29, 2016And here s Obama s full speech via YouTube:One day Republicans will regret the way they treated President Obama, especially since he has been one of the best leaders this country has elected to the office.

Take a look:Image via screen capture from ABC News videoHow fitting is that, considering Native Americans are called  native  for a reason that seems to escape Trump (and conservatives in general), and Trump wants to take us back to the bad ol  days of white supremacy because he s a disgusting bigot? She said: When Donald Trump says,  Make America Great Again,  what time period is he talking about? A lot of people overlook that America s history has been built upon injustice against other racial groups, including Native American people. She makes a very good point. The reason we don t have things like White History Month or Straight Pride Month is because this country was built for straight, white people in general, and straight, white men in specific; men like, oh, say, Donald the Trump. It was also built on the genocide of Native Americans, which is a fact of history that conservatives would erase from every one of our history books if they could, so they could cling to their delusion that America is more awesome than the rest of the planet.Enter Bowen s hats. His Royal Racist has demonstrated his racism against Native Americans by calling Elizabeth Warren  Pocahontas  repeatedly. One of his surrogates made fun of Warren s Native American heritage by doing a stereotypical  war whoop  during a rally. To Trump, recognizing Native Americans and actually respecting them amounts to more of the political correctness that he thinks is destroying our country.Bowen believes that making America great again means learning about Native Americans and respecting their culture, and not erasing them from history. Bowen also said: It means going back to learning sustainability and learning to live in harmony with the environment. It means going back to a matriarchal society in which we value and respect our women. It means going back to a sense of unity and community in which we nurture and care for each other rather than tear apart and divide each other. These are all things we need to do in order to ensure mankind s continued survival, if nothing else. His Royal Idiocy does not like these things, and does not see what the point of any of it is. He wants to keep things exactly the way they are while he s busy trying to make us great again. Everything he wants to do to  Make America Great Again  is an attack on Native American values, Bowen says.So really, what does Trump mean with that garbage of a slogan of his? He very likely means the 1950s and  60s, which were white men s most prosperous decades, but they weren t exactly prosperous for anybody else. Those white glasses of his, which filter out everything but whiteness, must be nice.Bowen s hats are hitting a lot of people the right way, and she s selling them for $30 apiece, here.

Three commissioners concluded Fox News violated election law; two of the Democratic commissioners went a step further and voted to penalize the network. But because any enforcement action requires four votes, the case was dismissed.Fox escaped penalty because of the partisan gridlock on the commission but their boost to Trump during the primaries (he was the most featured candidate on the network by a wide margin) shows what it takes to win the race on the right.While Fox has been able to capitalize on Trump thanks to the boost to the network s ratings (the same is true at CNN), the strategy may backfire for the Republican Party. Unlike other candidates who might be performing better in head-to-head matchups against Hillary Clinton at this point in the campaign, Trump is losing by double-digits in some polls, while poll aggregates also show him losing by a larger margin than Mitt Romney did in 2012.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

A lot of people say they aren t going to vote this November because their candidate didn t win,  Geist began before pointing out that millions of veterans won t be voting this year because they are dead.  Well, I know some other people who won t be voting this year either. Hillary as president   no thanks,  he continues.  I served in Benghazi. My friends didn t make it. They did their part. Do yours. The $2 million ad campaign then goes on to urge people to vote for Donald Trump.Here s the video via YouTube.As you can see, Geist is clearly being filmed inside of a national cemetery where filming is prohibited by the Department of Veterans Affairs. In order to film a commercial at such a sacred venue requires permission, which the NRA didn t bother to seek because they knew they wouldn t get it. That s because their campaign ad is obviously partisan and is using the graves of dead soldiers to attack a political opponent.VA spokesman James Hutton condemned the ad and confirmed that the NRA did not seek nor did they receive permission. The National Cemetery Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs has not received or approved any filming requests of this nature. NCA did not receive a request from the NRA to film the subject advertisement. If we had received such a request, we would have denied it based on the partisan content. Our veterans, their families and survivors are our top priority. To maintain the sanctity and decorum of VA National Cemeteries as national shrines, our filming policy states that filming may not be used for the expression of partisan or political viewpoints, or for uses that are (or may be interpreted as) an endorsement of a commercial entity. In short, the NRA disgraced this country and themselves by using the graves of our fallen heroes in their political witch hunt against Hillary Clinton. And this comes in the wake of House Republicans ending their four year long Benghazi investigation which failed to find any evidence that Clinton is to blame for the attack.Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the family of Ambassador Chris Stevens, who also died in Benghazi that day, do not hold Hillary Clinton responsible for the attack. In fact, they say the  underlying cause  for the lack of security is the way Republicans have slashed security funding for U.S. embassies and diplomatic personnel in the years prior to the attack. Perhaps if Congress had provided a budget to increase security for all missions around the world, then some of the requests for more security in Libya would have been granted,  said Dr. Anne Stevens, the sister of Ambassador Stevens.  Certainly the State Department is underbudgeted. I do not blame Hillary Clinton or [former CIA Director] Leon Panetta. They were balancing security efforts at embassies and missions around the world. And their staffs were doing their best to provide what they could with the resources they had. This is a sick campaign ad by the NRA and they should be ashamed of themselves for sinking to this depth in what is obviously a desperation play because they know their Republican nominee is getting his ass handed to him in the polls. If anything, this violation of the sanctity of the final resting place of many veterans, many of whom were probably not Republicans or members of the NRA, should enrage every American who claims to give a damn about the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.

So far this year, 16 children have died after being left in a hot car. Talisha Martin left her child alone in a vehicle for more than 40 minutes while she allegedly went shopping inside a Florida Walmart on Monday.According to a statement from the Palatka Police Department, the store s Loss Prevention Team notified them at about 4:00 p.m. that a 5-year-old child was unattended in a vehicle in the parking lot. The vehicle was running and the air conditioner was on, but it was blowing hot air   something that adds to the heat problem of being abandoned by one s mother in the parking lot of a Walmart during the day in the Florida heat. The child told officers that he was hot and  scared because mommy left me. When Martin finally arrived, her speech was stuttered and slurred. She didn t even notice her child was no longer in the car until an officer asked her if something was missing. The alleged  mother  was arrested and held on a $500 bond. The child was released to the custody of her husband, Scott Martin (more on him later).After her release from custody, Martin did what could be expected from a parent who practices such unabashed negligence: she whined about her  stupid  arrest, blaming it on black people.In her Facebook post, Martin contends that she ran into Walmart to  buy toilet paper a run-out that was it  (she told a news station she had been exchanging bras). According to her, she was only in the store for a total of 7 minutes   enough time for the car to reach 120 degrees without hot air blowing from the air conditioner, as it was 88 that day.But then  a black women  (unclear if she means one or multiple)  had her nose in business where it didn t belong and went and told Walmart.  This, of course, ruined everything for this obviously responsible parent by calling police. She says it s  pretty damn stupid  that they would charge her for child  neglect when  it could be 10 different charges they could give  her. After all, her child (the one who was scared because mommy left him)  asked  to stay in the car, she says.She then praises her loving husband (the one to whom the little boy was released), who bonded her out, for his support. While one might expect the other half of this relationship to give a damn about the child s safety   remember that the boy was released to him   Scott is very supportive of his wife. All this is b/s. My wife wasn t even gone from the house for fifteen minutes and i get a call from the police,  he writes in the comment section under the post.  They told me that my son was in the car for OVER AN HOUR!!!!!!!!! Pardon my language, but that is all f****** b*******!!!!! I am beyond being mad!!!!! He then angrily demands that police bust meth labs and other  people who are really breaking the law  rather than negligent mothers who leave their children unattended in hot vehicles with hot air blowing out of the air conditioner. It is s*** like this why I am thinking about leaving this f****d up county, and state for that matter & saying f*** all of this s***!!!!!!!!!  he adds.  And if there is anyone who disagrees with what I said, guess what, TOO BAD! It s called the 1st Amendment, look it up While the Martins might have expected sympathy, they didn t get much from their friends and family.  As some commenters mentioned, the Department of Children and Families will be investigating this matter. Not only is it illegal for a child to be left in a car, it is also inhumane and potentially deadly,  spokesman John Harrell said.  We will do a full and thorough investigation regarding this incident. Unfortunately, while Martin admits she was wrong and pledges to be a better mother in the future, it is unlikely that she nor her husband have learned anything from this. Scott Martin, whose Facebook profile indicates that he is former military police, says that  ALL THOSE THAT DON T BELIEVE THE TRUTH, AND THINK MY WIFE DONT CARE ABOUT OUR CHILDREN, THEN Y ALL CAN JUST GO TO H***. A few posts below one in which he claims they are loving parents is a share from Conservative Post that advocates hitting your children rather than exercising more reasonable and sane conflict resolution and disciplinary techniques:As for Talisha Martin, she told News4Jax that police and, apparently security footage, are lying about her. She says she won t do it again but denies that she was in the wrong for blasting hot air on her child in an already hot car: (Police) said that I was in there 40 minutes and that is a lie,  Martin said.  Also something about it wasn t even cold air coming out the vent, It was hot air, and that is not true. I just think it s wrong that I m being blasted out like that when I m a mother and have been a mother for almost ten years. I clearly won t do it again. I mean, I don t think I was in the wrong but it is,  Martin said.  Something could happen, you know. They can break the window out. I mean, stuff could happen, but it was only a few minutes. Martin has been arrested numerous times since 2011, twice of charges of petit theft and twice for probation violations.It would be nice if they would at least learn from this, but it seems that they are dedicated to just being terrible people.Featured image via Facebook/News4Jax""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

I know nothing about her and her family and replied in knee-jerk fashion. I d like to think the people of Mississippi and my constituents know that I m willing to help where I am able. I replied in knee-jerk fashion.  That s basically an admission that he thinks anyone receiving government aid is a lazy good-for-nothing living high on the hog off of the backs of hardworking taxpayers. That s what the entire GOP thinks about people on aid. What an obtuse piece of flotsam.Nichols told her story to the Clarion-Ledger, going into more detail in a video about her situation and why she needs these supplies:Nichols is a stay-at-home mom, but her husband works two jobs to provide for their family of four. The insulin pump, which her daughter needs to avoid having to go through six to ten injections every day, is $2,000. The insulin itself can run as much as $400 per month. Struggling families can t afford that, and no amount of  get a job  is going to change that.Nichols actually did receive two other replies, both of which were sympathetic to her situation. Thankfully, people like Guice aren t calling the shots here. Nichols posted about this on her Facebook page, prompting a barrage of outraged comments from people who read it. Mississippi Medicaid saw her post, actually had some compassion, and reached out to Nichols about this very situation.Guice, and the rest of the GOP, are heartless brutes. He might regret his comments, but the fact that he even made them shows that he s just another one of those who thinks everyone should just magically grow bootstraps with which to pull themselves up.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Many of those facts were science   something the GOP absolutely abhors.The ruling attacked Texas lawmakers for their sorry lack of those facts. The dissent from Justices Clarence Thomas, John Roberts and Samuel Alito seemed to focus more on defining the word  right,  and the definition of  undue burden  than it did on whether the law actually had a negative effect on Texas women.Thomas even went so far as to say: Moreover, by second-guessing medical evidence and making its own assessments of  quality of care  issues, the majority reappoints this Court as  the country s ex officio medical board with powers to disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States.' That isn t what happened. There s this thing called  expert witnesses,  and they testified on this case. Expert witnesses exist because judges can t be expected to know everything about everything. Breyer s opinion cited data, along with expert testimony, as the reason for why the court voted to strike the law down.As for where some of those experts came from? A team of researchers from the University of Texas has been looking hard at the effects of that law since it went into effect in 2013. They studied everything from abortion access in rural areas to Twitter traffic, and they found that the law did, indeed, restrict access to abortion. That just makes women decide to try and end their pregnancies themselves, and all this research points to that actually happening in Texas.The Texas GOP didn t like that at all. One of the reasons the GOP is so anti-science is because science often contradicts their policies, making them look like the dogmatic morons they are. Texas even went so far as to pressure their head of health research to resign because of this: Texas Republicans often said the researchers  math didn t check out. When one unflattering study in February suggested that funding cuts to Planned Parenthood restricted access to women s health care, the state s head of health research resigned under pressure from GOP lawmakers, who questioned his contributions to a  deeply flawed and highly political report.' To fire a state official for cooperating with scientific research that leads away from what you think, you re working to bury the research. That s what this was.When conservatives say,  I m not a scientist, and neither are you,  they re really just dodging the issue entirely. Sometimes, they re even shirking responsibility for the effects of, oh, say, a bad law like this one.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" Be careful what you wish for  is an age-old adage. Earlier this month, Donald Trump tweeted that  if you want to know about Hillary Clinton s honesty and judgement,  all you need to do is  ask the family of Ambassador Chris Stevens,  who died in the horrific terrorist attacks in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.via FreakOutNationOn Tuesday, after the House Benghazi Committee released its report on the attacks   a report that once again exonerated Clinton and confirmed that the numerous hearings are simply a waste of taxpayer dollars aimed at smearing the 2016 Democratic nominee   Ambassador Stevens  sister spoke to the New Yorker about the hearings, and Trump has likely dissolved into a steaming pile of seething rage over her remarks.Dr. Anne Stevens, who serves as her family s spokesperson, made it very clear that no matter what Republicans say, Hillary Clinton is not to blame for Benghazi. In fact, she says the blame lies with Republicans in Congress. It is clear, in hindsight, that the facility was not sufficiently protected by the State Department and the Defense Department. But what was the underlying cause?  she said.  Perhaps if Congress had provided a budget to increase security for all missions around the world, then some of the requests for more security in Libya would have been granted. Certainly the State Department is underbudgeted. Prior to the attacks, the GOP cut embassy security  a move Clinton warned would be detrimental to America s national security  back in 2011:For fiscal 2013, the GOP-controlled House proposed spending $1.934 billion for the State Department s Worldwide Security Protection program   well below the $2.15 billion requested by the Obama administration. House Republicans cut the administration s request for embassy security funding by $128 million in fiscal 2011 and $331 million in fiscal 2012. (Negotiations with the Democrat-controlled Senate restored about $88 million of the administration s request.) Last year, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Republicans  proposed cuts to her department would be  detrimental to America s national security    a charge Republicans rejected.[GOP vice presidential nominee Paul] Ryan, [Rep. Darrell] Issa and other House Republicans voted for an amendment in 2009 to cut $1.2 billion from State operations, including funds for 300 more diplomatic security positions. Under Ryan s budget, non-defense discretionary spending, which includes State Department funding, would be slashed nearly 20 percent in 2014, which would translate to more than $400 million in additional cuts to embassy security.Stevens goes on to drop the hammer on any words Republicans want to put in the mouths of her or her family:I do not blame Hillary Clinton or Leon Panetta. They were balancing security efforts at embassies and missions around the world. And their staffs were doing their best to provide what they could with the resources they had. The Benghazi Mission was understaffed. We know that now. But, again, Chris knew that. It wasn t a secret to him. He decided to take the risk to go there. It is not something they did to him. It is something he took on himself.Stevens says that the recently-released report concluded absolutely nothing new, and that Clinton did her best to keep people safe even in spite of fierce opposition from Republicans:She has taken full responsibility, being head of the State Department, for what occurred. She took measures to respond to the review board s recommendations. She established programs for a better security system. But it is never going to be perfect. Part of being a diplomat is being out in the community. We all recognize that there s a risk in serving in a dangerous environment. Chris thought that was very important, and he probably would have done it again. I don t see any usefulness in continuing to criticize her. It is very unjust.Stevens says that the GOP s investigations are nothing but a witch hunt conducted  purely for political reasons. With the many issues in the current election, to use that incident and to use Chris s death as a political point is not appropriate,  she adds, explaining that  everyone did their very best in response to this event.  In fact, her brother had a lot of respect for Clinton and her  ability to intensely read the issues and understand the whole picture. Could this be the final nail in the coffin of the GOP s ridiculous, money-wasting witch hunts? Probably not, unfortunately.Featured image via Getty Images/Justin Sullivan""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He wants to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA and he wants to renegotiate the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).Trump s words were tailored to his audience, many of whom have personally suffered from the collapse of the American steel industry: I m going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. And I don t mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better,  Trump said in Pennsylvania.If Canada and Mexico do not agree to renegotiate the pact, Trump said he would notify them under the agreement s terms  that America intends to withdraw from the deal. Source: Huffington PostOf course, most of the steel industry has moved to China, a country with whom we have no trade agreement, but why let inconvenient facts get in the way of a good narrative.In yet another speech, this time in Ohio, Trump spoke of the TTP, calling it a  death blow  for American manufacturing. He said it was  just a continuing rape of our country. Trump is right in that the trade deals have been bad for the American people and that they should be renegotiated, but Trump s claim that he s a savior for American trade is disingenuous. Much of Trump s fortune has been built on the backs of those in foreign countries. In other words, the Trump of today would probably not have been possible without the trade agreements he loves to criticize. AFL-CIO s President Richard Trumka agrees: Trump embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policy. He has consistently sent American jobs overseas to line his own pockets. Beyond that, though, is something more insidious and sexist. It s long been a Republican meme that Bill Clinton is a rapist and that Hillary Clinton is somehow complicit in these  crimes  (they aren t actually crimes because no one has ever found any criminal activity). Trump may or may not choose to be overt in rattling off the hundreds of Clinton conspiracy theories, but you can bet he ll continue with the more subliminal accusations, like one of rape.

Bush s biggest financial supporters was committing tax fraud the whole time while he simultaneously gave millions of dollars to Republican campaigns.And a federal judge smacked him for it on Monday.According to Reuters:A federal bankruptcy judge in Texas on Monday ordered former billionaire Sam Wyly to pay $1.11 billion in back taxes, interest and penalties after finding he committed tax fraud by shielding much of his family s wealth in offshore trusts.U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Barbara Houser in Dallas calculated the payout after ruling on May 10 that Wyly and his late brother Charles conducted a  deceptive and fraudulent  scheme to cheat the Internal Revenue Service.The payout includes roughly $135.5 million of taxes, $402.1 million of interest, and $570.1 million of penalties.It definitely makes one wonder what other big Republican donors like the Koch brothers have been hiding all this time. After all, they hate the federal government so much that they are buying conservative lawmakers to destroy it from within, and the IRS is a major target that Republicans have been particularly keen on eliminating.

Pea-brains like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, James Inhofe, and more allow their religions to have a stranglehold on their policy decisions. The GOP itself has taken the Establishment Clause to mean that Christians should be free to do whatever they want to whomever they want, but all other religions need to put up with being restricted, and shut up altogether.The FFRF has been working to keep church and state separate since 1978, and this billboard is a brilliant idea because it takes a quote from one of the GOP s own idols and turns it back on them. Some places, like The Blaze, have already claimed that the quote is taken out of context, which is nonsense. The full quote is: Our very unity has been strengthened by our pluralism. We establish no religion in this country, we command no worship, we mandate no belief, nor will we ever. Church and state are, and must remain, separate. All are free to believe or not believe, all are free to practice a faith or not, and those who believe are free, and should be free, to speak of and act on their belief. That s in no way taken out of context. Instead, it s basically a summary of what Reagan was saying. Furthermore, Reagan s own son, Ron Reagan Jr., is on the Honorary Board of Distinguished Thinkers at the FFRF, and is an atheist who isn t afraid to burn in hell. There s little question he supports this display.It s actually the hateful, judgmental, narrow-minded  Christians  of the religious right who don t want to follow the Constitution, and they re dragging the GOP along with them, all in the name of  following the Constitution.

Adultery is not a crime in the United States, but Anderson called for punishing those who commit it with death in a written manifesto on his blog last week. When someone says that homosexuality is worthy of death according to the Bible, people inevitably will bring up other sins that were also punishable by death in the Old Testament,  he wrote.  They think they are somehow catching us in hypocrisy, but the truth is, Bible believing Christians DO agree with those other Old Testament penalties as well we just need to realize that God s laws were the law of the land in those days. Today, adultery is not punishable by law in the United States, but it should be. Just as he did when he called for executing gay people, Anderson laid out his vision of a  righteous government,  presumably made up of conservative  Christians  who will shred the Constitution and replace it with the Bible, and said such a government would make adultery a capital crime worthy of arrest and death if convicted by what one can only imagine would be a kangaroo court. This, Anderson says, is the way he would prevent adultery and divorce.Yes, a righteous government would implement the death penalty for those tried and convicted of adultery. We all know normal people who have unfortunately committed this grievous sin, and of course we wouldn t want them to die for it. If we were to somehow vote in a law making adultery illegal, it would not be retroactive it would be the law going forward, and adultery rates would plummet and so would divorce rates. Think about it, though. Do you really think as many people commit adultery in societies where it is punishable by death? Of course not so you can relax about your Aunt Trudy who cheated on her husband thirty years ago. If Aunt Trudy had lived in a society that enforced the death penalty for adultery, chances are she would never have committed that sin in the first place.Indeed, other nations in the world do, in fact, punish adulterers with death. There s only one problem.As it turns out, punishing adultery by execution is something that occurs today mostly under Islamic law. Conservatives like Anderson would refer to this as  Sharia law.  And usually it overwhelmingly punishes women, especially women who have been raped.According to The Week,The UN has issued numerous calls to governments to repeal laws that criminalise adultery, arguing that they are predominantly used to discriminate against women.  Provisions in penal codes often do not treat women and men equally and establish harsher rules and sanctions for women,  writes human rights expert Frances Raday.Countries governed by Islamic law, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Somalia, all strictly prohibit  zina , or  fornication outside marriage . Prosecutions are common and punishment can include fines, arbitrary detention, imprisonment, flogging and in extreme cases, the death penalty. Women are overwhelmingly targeted.Human rights organisations argue that in several Muslim nations, adultery laws are often used against women who have been raped. Under such legislation, the burden of proof is on the woman to provide evidence that she was raped, or be prosecuted for adultery.In short, what Anderson is proposing is a barbaric practice that is mostly practiced in countries that are governed by some form of Sharia law and is used primarily to punish women.Basically, he is calling for the United States to be governed by Christian Sharia law. You know, the same Sharia law that conservatives freak out about and pass laws against.Anderson concluded his  sermon  by claiming that the death penalty deters crime and shrugged at the notion that people don t want their loved ones executed just because they had an extramarital affair.In countries where adultery is still a capital crime, it s not an everyday occurrence and usually ends up in the news. Just as capital punishment is a strong deterrent against murder, it has the same effect on other crimes.Telling us that we would not want people we know and care about to be put to death is a straw man argument. We don t want our friends and family to be convicted of murder either, but they probably won t kill anyone, so we don t worry about it. When the children of Israel committed adultery, they knew the risk going in.However, it s worth noting that multiple studies by researchers have been UNABLE to prove that the death penalty is a deterrent to crimeThe bottom line is that is that Anderson is a maniac who wants to bathe America in blood in order to create what he considers the perfect Christian utopia. Millions upon millions of Americans would be murdered in this endeavor if Anderson had his way, and that is precisely why conservative  Christians  can never be allowed to have power in our government.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This isn t just any hearing on radical Islam, though. It s specifically investigating why President Obama won t use the term  radical Islamic terrorism  when he s talking about radical Islamic terrorism.Seriously.Ted Cruz, a United States Senator, is using Congressional resources, and taking up Congressional time, to investigate words.We wish we were making this up.The hearing s goal is to amp up his message that Obama s refusal to use those specific words has weakened our national security, and the primary accusation is that Obama has been scrubbing the words  radical Islamic terrorism  from public records in order  to pretend the threat doesn t exist. There is a metric ton of right-wing news sites and blogs that pushed a conspiracy theory that Obama censored references to radical Islam from a video of a meeting with French President Francois Hollande, just after the Paris attacks last year. It turns out there was a technical glitch with the recording equipment that dropped the audio at that point in the meeting. As soon as the White House became aware of the problem, they published an updated video with complete audio.Ted Cruz, being the unintelligent, irrational individual we know him to be, would rather waste his subcommittee s time and taxpayer dollars on vapid conspiracy nonsense if it means taking Obama down. The truth is that Obama won t use those specific words because he s trying to isolate ISIS, and terrorists, from the broader Islamic world. He s said: [W]e are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam. That is the cold, naked truth that the cowering right won t accept. George W. Bush said the same thing many times throughout his presidency. Here s one example from 2002, not too long after Sept. 11: This great nation of many religions understands, our war is not against Islam, or against faith practiced by the Muslim people. Our war is a war against evil.  [emphasis mine]Ted Cruz, whose brain is the size of a peanut, won t acknowledge that though, because reasons. Others, however, will try to force him to acknowledge it. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) did that, saying at the hearing: I have plenty of disagreements with President George W. Bush, but I still marvel that after all we went through [he still pushed us to distinguish between the vast majority of Muslims and a few dangerous extremists]. There s a serious problem when a Democrat can make George W. Bush actually look like a good president. These usurpers of American patriotism not only excel at ignoring pesky things like that, but they also excel at just plain looking foolish. Cruz even had a witness there that went so far as to accuse Reps. Keith Ellison (D-MN) and Andre Carson (D-IN) of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, simply because they attended a Muslim event once. Ellison and Carson are the only two Muslims serving in Congress.What can we expect from the man who appointed noted Islamophobe Frank Gaffney, of all people, to his presidential campaign team as a national security adviser, though? Gaffney thinks that Grover Norquist is a secret Muslim; it s hard to take anything he says or does any more seriously than we take the word vomit that spews forth from Donald Trump s mouth.Bottom line: Cruz is pursuing a vendetta of some type against Obama. Either that, or he s desperate to cement his legacy as one of the best Senators we ve ever seen before Obama leaves office. He s only cementing his legacy as an out-of-control loon who complains about big government and wasted money, but has no problem using the government and wasting money to pursue fluff.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And their biggest delusional conspiracy theory of all is that the United Nations is going to take over America and confiscate everyone s guns.So when some UN vehicles were being taken for shipping overseas from the American manufacturer, a conservative motorist freaked out after seeing them on the road and immediately warned others on social media that a UN invasion is imminent. Can t begin to tell you how many of these I passed today on 81 near Lexington VA,  wrote conservative Jeff Stern along with photos of the vehicles being hauled on trailers.And that touched off a collective panic among right-wingers who are likely setting up bunkers around their homes and loading every gun they own about now like Texas conservatives did when they heard about the military training exercise known as Jade Helm.Stern saw the vehicles being transported along Interstate 81 around Lexington, Virginia, which some conservatives mistook for Lexington, Kentucky and thus ended up spreading the rumor of UN vehicles being spotted in both states. The Daily Mail decided to blow the story out of proportion and literally wondered if the UN was here in the event of economic collapse, which only created more panic among mentally unstable conservativesParanoid conservatives even panicked about the standard features of the vehicles, which include bullet resistant glass and seals that prevent exposure to poison gas. Considering where UN workers usually end up in the world these two features are totally necessary and American military vehicles have the same features for the same reasons.Snopes even contacted the maker of these particular vehicles and received a reasonable explanation for why the vehicles were being transported.Unlike the Daily Mail, we contacted Alpine Armoring, the manufacturer named in their article, to inquire about the images. According to an individual with whom we spoke at Alpine, the vehicles seen in these photographs were purchased by the United Nations for use outside the United States. A number of defense industry manufacturers are based in and around Washington, D.C. (a region that includes Virginia) for obvious logistical reasons, and the representative confirmed that the trucks were ordered by the UN for use in locations abroad.After manufacturing, the UN vehicles require transportation to their final ports of call inside the U.S., and driving them to those final embarkation points could potentially put several thousand miles on them prior to their being loaded onto cargo planes or ships, so the trucks seen here were loaded onto a flatbed truck and transported in that fashion. It is a reasonable inference that, depending on their route and final destination, the same trucks would be spotted in other Southern states (particularly if they were to be sent abroad via a cargo ship leaving from a Southern port).But you can t expect conservatives to accept reason, which is why they shared Stern s post over 120,000 times and made comments like these:Even Sarah Palin contributed to the panic among conservatives by buying into the theory that the UN is here to take our guns away.Yeah, the stupidity is truly breathtaking.Featured image via Facebook""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Like Trump, Newman pledges that the proceeds from his signature food sales will go to charity. Trump promised that sales from Trump Vodka, Trump University and two books would go to charity. Unlike Trump, Newman makes good on his promise. In fact, the last time Trump gave to charity, it was 2008.If Trump stands by his promises, such donations should be occurring all the time. In the past 15 years, Trump has promised to donate earnings from a wide variety of his money-making enterprises:  The Apprentice.  Trump Vodka. Trump University. A book. Another book. If he honored all those pledges, Trump s gifts to charity would have topped $8.5 million.But in that time, public records show, Trump donated about $2.8 million   less than a third of the pledged figure   through a foundation set up to give his money away. And there is no evidence that Trump has given to his foundation lately: The last record of any gift from him to his foundation was in 2008.Source: Washington PostThe Washington Post has been on this story for a while, likely because amid claims that he gives millions of his personal funds to charity, Trump refuses to offer up any proof in the way of tax returns or anything else.All of this seems very strange for a man who has his own charitable foundation. While the foundation seemed to start off on the right foot, in later years, it resembles more of a way to collect money from other people than anything resembling generosity on the part of Trump.When he founded the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 1988, the mogul gave half a million dollars, and donated another million the next year. But throughout much of the 1990s, Trump contributed little to his foundation. And despite his vaunted personal wealth allegedly totaling in the billions, according to publicly available records, Trump personally contributed $5,093,512 to his foundation between 1988 and 2014. (During that same time period, an additional $7,072,645 was donated by outside individuals and organizations.) In seven of those years, Trump personally contributed nothing.Even in some cases where foundation records show Trump likely did follow through, the donations don t match the original lofty boasts. In 1989, for instance, Trump released  Trump: The Game,  a version of Monopoly. He bragged that the game would earn $20 million   and that he d give it all to AIDS and cerebral palsy research and toward helping the homelessness. Trump barely gave money to his foundation for most of the 1990s, however.Two years later, a lawsuit against Trump revealed that the game had earned him just $866,800 in royalties, with Trump speculating that the game was perhaps too complex to be a big seller. In that same lawsuit, Trump reportedly said he donated the full proceeds to his charitable foundation. He publicly said that total donations resulting from the game amounted to $1 million, an amount corroborated by public records.Source: BuzzfeedThat s just the tip of the iceberg. Buzzfeed documented numerous times when Trump promised money and never delivered.The Washington Post went even further and contacted 167 charities in search of those missing gifts promised over the last severn years. They found just one donation. It was somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 to the Police Athletic League of New York City. That was it. One charity, one paltry amount of money.

Either this meant they had something explosive and wanted to unload it, or it meant they had absolutely nothing and wanted to bury the wasted energy, money and time spent on this anti-Hillary Clinton hit job long before the election rolled around.Upon releasing the document, it became instantly clear which option this was: Even after five years, the Republican-led Benghazi investigation found absolutely zero evidence that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. Nor did they find a single way Clinton could have saved any of the victims. In short, the investigation was a complete and total dud.As the New York Times summed up:Ending one of the longest, costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history, the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report on Tuesday, finding no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead.Not that Republicans didn t try their hardest. The investigation cost a truly staggering $7 million and took years to conduct. At every turn, the evidence suggested Clinton was not irresponsible with her actions while Secretary of State, and at every turn that evidence was ignored in the hopes that there was a bombshell just around the corner.Also admitted to during the final report? President Obama didn t  lie  to the American people about what happened in Benghazi. That was right-wing spin.The investigations generally concluded that after the attack, the Obama administration s talking points   a matter of much dispute   were flawed but not deliberately misleading.The idea that President Obama would have all the information to accurately describe what was unfolding in Benghazi as it happened was preposterous. As someone once wryly remarked, George W. Bush spent years telling the American public that Iraq was responsible for 9/11, President Obama spent a few hours saying  we don t know  what happened in Benghazi. Hardly an impeachable offense.Nevertheless, Republicans   including Trump s campaign   have tried to make a lot of political noise based on these rumors. In a sick irony, Trump s own lawyer spent the same morning this report was released openly accusing Hillary Clinton of  murder  because of Benghazi.NBC/WSJ poll has @realDonaldTrump beating #CrookedHillary on #Honesty & #NationalSecurity. This picture says it all! pic.twitter.com/E9YKIgoqnV  Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) June 28, 2016Clinton was understandably relieved to have this nonsense put past her. Despite the lack of evidence, certain corners of the internet routinely cited Benghazi as a reason not to vote for her. That talking point has finally and comprehensively come undone. After more than two years and more than $7 million in taxpayer funds, the Committee report has not found anything to contradict the conclusions of the multiple, earlier investigations,  a spokesman for the Clinton campaign said in a statement.  This report just confirms what Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and even one of Trey Gowdy s own former staffers admitted months ago: this Committee s chief goal is to politicize the deaths of four brave Americans in order to try to attack the Obama administration and hurt Hillary Clinton s campaign. In many ways, this final white flag by Republicans represents the increasingly despondent way they are viewing the upcoming election. Their candidate is a belligerent, self-aggrandizing bigot that is currently losing by historic numbers in the polls. If the GOP had any shot at competing in this election with that guy, they needed something like Benghazi to derail Clinton. Instead, they were forced to admit there was nothing there.By releasing the report now, there is a clear sense that the Republican Party is hoping to dig their trenches, hunker down and wait out whatever comes next. The Benghazi investigation going down in flames isn t exactly a game-ender, but it s certainly not the game-changer they had hoped for either.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Anderson s hatred of the LGBT community, Muslims, Jews, women, and even President Obama, is so deeply rooted that he genuinely believes that he is simply following the Bible (you know, if you cut out all that stuff about loving thy neighbor).Recently, Anderson ignited international outrage when he called the Orlando massacre  good news  because lots of gay people died. In December 2014, he said that we could cure AIDS if we exterminated all the  homos. This may seem like frightening rhetoric, but it pales in comparison to what he said Sunday night.Anderson told his congregation that they   the hateful, anti-gay hate group    have more love in our little finger than that f*ggoty church down the street  that supports the LGBT community has  in their whole body.  Anderson says that he is, indeed, required to love his neighbor but his  homosexual neighbor should be dead. Shortly before those remarks, Anderson said something truly horrifying about what  perfect Christians  should be doing. Anderson says that while most sinners can find God, the LGBT community is hopeless because it is impossible for them to love or accept Jesus. Here s the thing about those filthy reprobates,  Anderson told his congregation.  They re not going to turn from their wickedness because  God has darkened their heart and blinded their eyes.  Anderson continued, explaining that if God has done such things,  you can t believe.  Referencing Psalm 58:10, which states that the righteous (Anderson s flock in this case)  will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked  (the LGBT community).The pastor says that he doesn t understand why his praise of the Orlando shooter made people angry because he, nor the other pastors who have made headlines for their horrific Orlando remarks, didn t fly to Florida and bathe their feet in the blood of the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in our country s history. I don t think Pastor Romero hopped on a plane to Orlando so he could just go wash his feet in the blood of the wicked and praise God for their death,  Anderson quipped as his congregation laughed at the super-funny awesome joke.  But if he would have, it would have been OK.  More laughter. Then he described his  perfect world. If we were in a perfect world, if we were perfect Christians, if we were doing everything that God wanted us to do,  Anderson said, then they would sing not only hymns but the Psalms. And what better way to sing them but while having a nice,  reprobate  blood foot bath: Why would God want us to sing about washing our feet in the blood of the wicked in the New Testament? Can someone explain that to me? Because it s  valid today. Because it still stands. Because God is still the same God. Anderson said that other Christians   the fake ones who accept others for who they are   accuse him of saying that  if a homo loves Jesus he still won t be saved.  Banging his head against a tree prop, the pastor angrily explained that he didn t ever say that: Argh, I never said that. I m saying they don t believe in Jesus. Anybody who believes in Jesus will be saved. I m saying they don t believe in Jesus.  But I met one who says he loves Jesus.  THEY RE LYING. Get real folks. And yet they still come at you. Anderson s sermon then dissolved into a mini-rant about how  normal people  don t want to do the  stuff  that gay people do (like mowing the lawn, shopping, riding a bicycle, playing chess, watching television ). Who here struggles really hard to not be a homo,  Anderson said with his hand raised. He was the only one who raised his hand.  I mean it s really hard. Other men are just so appealing and it s a struggle   No, you re like gross, it s disgusting.

That s the vile headline on a story republished on Fox News from capital bigot Laura Ingraham s site, Lifezette. The headline was crafted specifically to make people recoil in horror due to the misbegotten idea that the LGBT community is all about pushing the  homosexual agenda  onto our children. Below is a screen capture of the story sitting on Fox News  website, for all to see:The story itself almost waxes poetic on the dangers of LGBT indoctrination, attacking a series of online videos called  Queer Kids Stuff.  That series intended to help parents talk to their children about the LGBT community in a way that s easy for them to understand. Bigoted, homophobic conservatives, however, see this as predatory, claiming that the only way the movement wins is by going after ever-younger groups of children.The videos haven t made their way into preschools yet, but that s exactly what Sean Ryan, the communications director of Mass Resistance, an alleged  pro-family  group, is afraid of: It is easily conceivable that videos such as these will be sanctioned eventually by local school boards and implemented in preschool and prekindergarten classes.Activists are trying to force these topics on younger and younger children because that is the only way their movement wins.Rational adults don t buy into the so-called  Queer Theory  or transgenderism. Unfortunately, children are a soft target for homosexual activists as they are malleable and still learning about the world. We have to wonder who these rational adults are, and whether he even knows the definition of  rational,  since he clearly isn t. Chances are he means narrow-minded, extremist fanatics like himself, who think that the LGBT community needs to go back into the closet and stay there, so we can all go back to pretending they don t exist, like we used to. Ryan even alluded to that in the story: There was once a time when it was unthinkable to even mention the topic of homosexuality in a school setting. Now, there are homosexual, bisexual [and] transgender lesson plans for kids as young as kindergarten. He believes that the reason today s parents might support something he views as gross is because they, themselves, were indoctrinated and don t even realize it. There s no way of convincing someone this close-minded and black-hearted that nobody was brainwashed, except, perhaps, them.The New Civil Rights Movement said that Fox News should change the headline. They should, but they won t, because it says exactly what they want to say.  It s all about the children, we swear!  the haters scream.

In the spirit of the situation, SCOTUSblog decided they should  explain  what was really going on, considering these trolls seriously mistake them for the Supreme Court. #BREAKING: facing constitutional crisis, in an unprecedented move, a blog was named to the empty ninth seat on the Supreme Court.

That should have been enough to convince the nation that CNN didn t care at all about balanced coverage. On Monday, though, they even outdid that, by completely gushing over the GOP frontrunner and calling him mature, because his latest wasn t completely racist.As of the publication of this article, Trump s Twitter account has been uncharacteristically quiet for 10 hours. Ironically, his last tweet was complaining about CNN..@CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don t watch it anymore.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 27, 2016He also very characteristically insulted both Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren: Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 27, 2016During those 10 silent hours, though, Trump released a press release and he was interviewed by an NBC reporter. CNN s panel was very impressed with the interview and with Trump s press release, well, because it didn t call Warren  Pocahontas.  He only called her  racist  because Warren once claimed, thanks to family lore, that she was five percent Native American.Okay, he actually did call her Pocahontas during the interview: We call her Pocahontas for a reason,  said Trump.  She said she s 5 percent Native American. She was unable to prove it. She used the fact that she was Native American to advance her career. Elizabeth Warren is a total fraud  She made up her heritage, which I think is racist. I think she s a racist, actually, because what she did was very racist. To CNN, though, this was a sign of a mature Donald Trump. He has been calling Elizabeth Warren,  Pocahontas,  repeatedly,  Brianna Keilar said.  This is the more grown up way to put what he is   what his allegation is. Nia-Malika Henderson agreed, saying that it was a kind of  mature version of a non-fifth grade version of the  Pocahontas    what some people think is an insult.  It is unclear if she meant that Trump had graduated to more middle-school attacks like  I know you are but what am I. He is talking about policy, he is saying she is a sellout to the cause,  Henderson continued.  I do think we are seeing a slow maturation of Donald Trump. Again, he sort of is still doing the same thing calling her goofy, nodding to the heritage. Which is sort of a weird thing, we don t typically talk about people s ethnic backgrounds in presidential politics. But, this is where he is. You see this creeping professionalism, professionalization of Trump s campaign, where he personally, when he tweets, it is usually sort of a, frankly, a schoolyard taunt,  Ryan Lizza explained.  If you look at the stuff they are sending out in press releases that is done by the campaign, it is a little bit more of a targeted, the way to get at Elizabeth Warren is to argue she is selling out her principles by endorsing Clinton. Source: Raw StoryHere s the video:Is this Trump benefitting from low expectations or is it something more nefarious? It s probably a bit of both. His rhetoric is so divisive and so immature, that anything above the 5th grade level seems  adult,  but beyond that, Trump is a ratings bonanza and CNN doesn t want to risk being cut off from the billionaire.As for Elizabeth Warren, well, she never claimed that she was Native American to get into Harvard, or anywhere else. That was made up.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President.

It really doesn t get much better than that in regards to a tag-team of lunacy.Not to disappoint, Palin took to the Politicon stage in Pasadena, CA, to promote Trump with what we can only assume are sentences in her own mind. However, she is saying words, so, here a few of them: They whispered that they re going to throw in for Hillary against the will of the people in their own primary, and this exposed the establishment s con game. More people learn it doesn t matter to the Beltway bubble boys and girls which side wins elections, as long as they get to keep their titles and their ratings and their power and their purses full.

I ll let you read that again to really soak that in Profiles in pudding,   bent over,   lily-white  yeah, she just said all those things in one sentence.Then, while trying to say that even many Republicans are starting to back Hillary Clinton, she said: They re not all thumbsuckers, they re not all bad .

Actually, Palin, she can win without them, but seeing them embrace sanity over crazy is something to admire.She then rambles on a bit, then offers us this gem about Trump relating to Americans: He gratefully shakes skilled, calloused hands and tugs tight the blue-collar, and he salutes in awe of sacrifice, the American in uniform. It s connection through appreciation, and I do wish you all could know him on that personal level. Palin apparently forgets that he recently threw our military under the bus, claimed to raise funds for them, but didn t, and also got five deferments of his own so he didn t have to serve. He also wouldn t know a hard days work if it was in front of his face and wouldn t know calloused hands if they were the ones stroking his ever-ginormous ego.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""The Supreme Court sided with women on freedom and the right to choose today with their ruling on Texas  restrictive abortion law. In a 5-3 ruling, they said that the arguments that the law merely protects women s health are actually just a substantial burden on women seeking abortions. Since abortion is a constitutional right, no matter what the right-wing thinks, Texas  law was deemed unconstitutional.Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion, and said: There was no significant health-related problem that the new law helped to cure. We agree with the District Court that the surgical-center requirement, like the admitting-privileges requirement, provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an  undue burden  on their constitutional right to do so. He was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Ginsburg wrote her own concurring opinion, where she said: When a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners, faute de mieux, at great risk to their health and safety. The 5-3 decision isn t just a victory for women and women s rights, but it also shows that the Supreme Court would have struck the law down even with a full bench, and a staunch conservative in Scalia s place. Anybody who thinks that a full bench would have stopped this is living in Fantasyland.Even so, anti-choice conservatives are still busy trying to convince people that the law actually protected women. Nothing could be further from the truth, which is why this case went all the way to the Supreme Court. Yet, here they are, in all their righteous anger about it, claiming that today is a sad day for women all across the country.Texas Governor Greg Abbott said (all emphasis from The New York Times): The decision erodes states  lawmaking authority to safeguard the health and safety of women, and subjects more innocent life to being lost. Texas  goal is to protect innocent life while ensuring the highest health and safety standards for women. Senator John Cornyn seems to agree with that. He said: Today s ruling sets a dangerous precedent for states like Texas, which the Constitution makes clear should be free to pass laws that are in the best interests of our citizens. Common-sense requirements that abortion clinics be held to the same standards as other medical facilities put the health of the patient first, and today s decision is a step back in protecting the well-being of mothers across our state. You two just keep telling yourselves that.Of course, National Right To Life can always be counted on to provide total ignorance masquerading as sane, logical reasoning on the issue of abortion: How shabby are these abortion clinics that they cannot meet the minimum standards other outpatient surgical centers are required to meet, and just how bad are these abortionists that they can t get admitting privileges at a local hospital? As we saw with Kermit Gosnell in Philadelphia, it s clear that the lucrative abortion industry is not able or willing to police itself and allows filthy, deplorable conditions to go unchecked. Ah, yes, invoking Kermit Gosnell, as if he s the norm and abortion doctors who are actually ethical and competent are the exception. Don t they have more evidence than that? Oh, wait, no they don t. One case is more than enough for them to think they can justify destroying a woman s right to choose what she does with her own body.Over on Twitter, many are celebrating this as the victory for women it is, but there are still anti-choicers rearing their ugly heads with the same twisted logic, spinning this as a grave mistake endangering thousands of women. Or they re making the argument that this violates states  rights (or doing both).

Seems like a no-brainer, but if you re a domestic abuser, you ve already proven yourself to not have much cognitive ability.The case in question was about a Maine resident who was mad he lost his right to possess a firearm. According to CNN: Stephen Voisine pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge in 2004 against a girlfriend. Five years later, he was investigated for shooting a bald eagle and as part of the investigation he turned over a firearm to authorities. Seems like a real winner. Oh, and a bald eagle? Really? And he thinks he should be able to own a gun?Well, guess what, Mr. Voisine, and all you other domestic abusers out there, you don t get to own a gun.Justice Elena Kagan read the opinion of the Court: Federal law prohibits any person convicted of a  misdemeanor crime of domestic violence  from possessing a firearm. That phrase is defined to include any misdemeanor committed against a domestic relation that necessarily involves the  use . . . of physical force.  The question presented here is whether misdemeanor assault convictions for reckless (as contrasted to knowing or intentional) conduct trigger the statutory firearms ban. We hold that they do. Kagan then cited the gun law that was enacted by Congress two decades ago: Congress enacted some 20 years ago to  close [a] dangerous loophole  in the gun control laws. United States v. Castleman. An existing provision already barred convicted felons from possessing firearms. But many perpetrators of domestic violence are charged with misdemeanors rather than felonies, notwithstanding the harmfulness of their conduct. And  [f]irearms and domestic strife are a potentially deadly combination.  Accordingly, Congress added to prohibit any person convicted of a  misdemeanor crime of domestic violence  from possessing any gun or ammunition with a connection to interstate commerce. Guns and domestic violence are an incredibly lethal combination. Kudos to the Court for stepping up and doing the right thing. Not every Tom, Dick or Sally just deserves to have a gun just because of the Second Amendment. The amendment was written to arm standing state militias, that were to be trained and utilized by the federal government. It s pretty clear if you read the entire Constitution, especially Article 1 Section 8, and not just the Amendment added to arm the aforementioned militias.Hopefully this is just the beginning of the Supreme Court waking up and realizing guns are lethal and should be better regulated the whole way around. Maybe Congress can take a few notes.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Image""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

They are currently being held on a $20,000 bond.St. Louis police believe that the pair has carried out similar attacks against people of color in the past. They are asking any person who believes they were targeted by the two men to come forward. These weren t two white teenagers on a joy ride,  St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said during an interview with the Post-Dispatch.Indeed, this was a deliberate, planned and unprovoked act of hate, carried out by two adult men.As reported here, hate crimes like this can have a lingering psychological impact both on the targeted victim and on the Black community as a whole.Racially motivated attacks cause  generalized terror in the group to which the victim belongs, inspiring feelings of vulnerability over the other members, who could be the next victims. People of color have been terrorized by racist whites since the United States was founded.Over the past year racially motivated attacks have become more and more common across the U.S., a fact which can be directly attributed to the rise of Donald Trump.Trump s racist hate speech has been cited as the motivation for everything from targeted racist mailings, directed at members of the Latino community, to the brutal assault and beating of a homeless man by two Boston-area brothers.As Addicting Info reported here:Since last September, America s Voice has been tracking instances where Trump, his staff and his supporters have assaulted or harassed immigrants and Latinos. As you can imagine, his special brand of xenophobia and racism has caused a lot of white nationalists to feel comfortable with their hate for  others. Using reports of Trump inspired racist attacks, the group created an interactive map which shows just how dangerous the candidate s hate speech really is.While we hear Trump and his supporters talk a lot about the dangers of Muslim terrorists in the U.S., racist white terrorists remain the most common, and the most dangerous threat to American citizens.Residents of the United States are seven times more likely to be killed by a right-wing terrorist than a Muslim terrorist. Nearly 60 percent of hate crimes committed in the United States are motivated by racial and ethnic bias. Another 20 percent are motivated by gender identity and sexual orientation. Religiously motivated hate crimes, attacks on Muslims, Jews, atheists and other non-Christian groups, also account for nearly 20 percent of hate crimes.Contrary to Trump s propaganda, we don t need a watch-list to identify who the real terrorists are. We have more than enough evidence to identify the hateful, violent and dangerous groups that are terrorizing the American people.Featured image via limecools on Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Now that their nominee for President of the United States is a proud and open bigot, other members of the GOP are concealing their own prejudices   or at least some are.Then you have some who just don t care, and are perfectly fine with exposing themselves as ignorant, bigoted whack jobs.Take former Republican Representative Joe Walsh. A one term member of Congress turned radio host, Walsh made a name for himself by being an outspoken critic of the Obama Administration, and went from being a self-described moderate to a full fledged Tea Partier. Now, we all know how heartless he was when he called on the Obama Admin. to secure the boarder with moats and alligators. But now he s exposed himself as truly one of the most backwards honking racists in the American political atmosphere.Yesterday, Walsh thought it would be a good idea to refer to the election of Barack Obama as the most racist event in American history:The single greatest act of racism in American history was the election of Barack Obama.People voted for him simply because he was black.  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) June 26, 2016Yes, he actually said that. In his eyes, the election of the United States  first African-American president was more racist than the following: the Trail of Tears, slavery, Japanese internment, or Jim Crow. These are just some (but certainly not all) of the dark, racist brutalities committed in American history, and a middle-aged, white Republican man thinks Obama being elected by the will of the people is the most racist thing to happen.It s as if Republicans are trying to officially be the party of racism and sheer stupidity.And while Republicans go on and on about how Democrats don t respect the will of the people, they decide their best and brightest ought to insult the will of the American electorate, who decided to choose President Obama (twice), not because of his skin color, but because his ideas were better than McCain and Romney s.Republicans still have not managed to understand their own autopsy report from 2012, when minority voters delivered one hell of a wake up call to their hopes of taking back the White House. Instead of heeding the warning, they have decided to double down on the hopes that their precious white voters would ride in and save the day. It didn t work in 2012, it certainly won t work in 2016. And considering President Obama s approval rating is at a five year high of 56 percent, insulting his election as  racist  and insulting the intelligence of his voters certainly won t help make the GOP s case.This is a guy who accused Tammy Duckworth (who beat him in his reelection bid) of politicizing her war record and injuries sustained in combat. This is the guy who, after his term ended, attempted to forego paying child support because he was  unemployed.  This is the guy who thinks two national elections were decided simply because of a man s skin color.This is the face of the GOP.Featured image via Gage Skidmore""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Brexit turned the U.K. into what we ve become here, thanks to the rise of Donald Trump.What s sad is that, according to The Independent, many of the perpetrators of these crimes cite the  leave  vote as a reason for their crimes, because that totally makes it okay. Yet, the victims of those crimes aren t just immigrants   many of them are people who were born in the U.K., but don t look sufficiently  domestic  for the xenophobic white supremacists that have taken over the country.Sound familiar? It s because we have that problem here, thanks to Trump and his xenophobic, white supremacist followers. Just look at what CBS reporter Sopan Deb goes through while covering His Royal Racist. He s repeatedly asked if he works for ISIS, and is frequently the target of Islamophobic remarks from Trump s loyal fans. He was also assaulted by cops at Trump s cancelled rally in Chicago.Social media is abuzz with this.

At the time she, she says, she believed that the poster was printed years ago and just never taken down.When she and her family visited another Colorado pool, this time in Fort Morgan, Sawyer was shocked to find the exact same poster on display there.

Instead, Trump is accusing Obama of being too anti-immigrant.Yes, you read that right. In an interview in Scotland, he said that he would limit deportations to countries with known terrorists and he would start over again on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. He toned down his usual xenophobic rhetoric to say that his policies would have  heart,  unlike, according to him, President Obama. President Obama has mass deported vast numbers of people   the most ever, and it s never reported. I think people are going to find that I have not only the best policies, but I will have the biggest heart of anybody,  Trump said.Pressed on whether he would issue  mass deportations,  Trump answered:  No, I would not call it mass deportations. Source: Bloomberg.comIt s a damned good thing that Trump has the best health insurance money can buy, because he s risking a serious case of whiplash. In the last few months alone, Trump has said about immigration: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on. According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. That s pretty definitive. I think Islam hates us,  Trump told CNN s Anderson Cooper after he was asked whether he thinks Islam is at war with the West.  There s a tremendous hatred. We have to get to the bottom of it. There is an unbelievable hatred of us. If Islam hates us (they don t), then why let in immigrants from any country at all? I will build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me and I ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. The entire foundation of his campaign was built around this  wall.  I never thought of Mexico as a Muslim country, let alone one that hates us. I do business with the Mexican people, but you have people coming through the border that are from all over. And they re bad. They re really bad. You have people coming in, and I m not just saying Mexicans, I m talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists and they re coming into this country. I guess he won t be keeping these people out. We must have strong borders and not let illegal immigrants enter the United States. As has been stated continuously in the press, people are pouring across our borders unabated. Public reports routinely state great amounts of crime are being committed by illegal immigrants. If anything, this latest pivot could be a misguided attempt to appeal to Bernie Sanders voters, who often disagree with Obama s deportation policies. Yes, it is true that Obama has deported a record number of immigrants, but that s not a fact we would have heard from the Donald Trump of last week or last month, or likely of tomorrow.h/t: Newsday, America s Voice | Featured image via Jeff J.

When responding to questions regarding German Cardinal Reinhard Marx, who suggested the Church apologize, Francis doubled down: I will repeat the same thing I said on the first trip.

The entire community was rocked to its core by the Orlando massacre, and how they feel right now is evident in Pride celebrations that are more subdued than usual.Some have avoided Pride altogether out of fear. Others have refused to engage anybody that might show the slightest hint that they re bigoted towards the LGBT community. Make no mistake, Orlando was a direct attack on their community and they have every reason to be terrified right now.Where are the Republicans who decried Orlando? Oh, right, twiddling their thumbs, shaking their heads, and making empty gestures so they don t piss off their evangelical base. Paul Ryan said that authorities knew Omar Mateen had specifically targeted the LGBT community. Then he gave the LGBT community a big  fuck you  when he introduced a rule that the House wouldn t vote on any measure giving workplace protections to LGBT employees of federal contractors.Marco Rubio pretended to mourn the massacre while saying that it can make people think harder about where they can best serve their countries. It s not likely he s talking about military service, and that was a ridiculous way of saying he ll continue to work on behalf of the hate-filled evangelicals from which the horror of Orlando came.And then there s good ol  Ted Cruz.

She s also unafraid to show up at a major Pride event to show her support. She didn t let the organizers know about her plans because monkey wrenches of all sorts had already been thrown into the works for so many Pride celebrations, thanks to Orlando, so it wasn t totally a surprise.

On Sunday, USA Today reported that the First Lady and her daughters are on their way to Liberia and Morocco as part of the Let Girls Learn initiative, a program the President and Michelle started last year to educate the more than 62 million girls worldwide who don t attend school.While there, Michelle Obama plans to meet with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, the first female elected head of state on the continent of Africa, as well as speak to local teenage girls. This is very important, as nearly two-thirds of Liberia s school-aged children do not attend class. In Morocco, 85% of girls are enrolled in primary schools but that number drops as low as 14% by high school.This is, of course, a very important problem and an admirable initiative   so, naturally, conservatives have a problem with it. The comment section of USA Today quickly flooded with racist remarks, with conservatives demanding that the Obamas stay there   with many gleefully declaring that they are going  home  and demanding that they take other black people with them. And, of course, the  not-racists  seized upon the opportunity to call them monkeys:      It s not just USA Today; Everywhere we have looked at this story, the comment section is the same. Take news station WKYC, for example:          It s almost like the Obama family can t do anything without being subjected to racist hatred. When Malia Obama graduated high school, conservatives everywhere congratulated her by calling her a n*gger and other unsavory terms. When she got into Harvard, the racist hatred was so horrific that Fox News was forced to close down the comment section. When Sasha Obama turned 15, she was subjected to a barrage of bigotry. They even periodically dredge up old sources of their outrage to relive their opportunity to bash the Obama children.It s important to remember that each and every one of these racist dickbags will be voting in November.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""On Sunday, Meet the Press host Chuck Todd revealed more specifics that help make the case that Donald Trump is raking in big money from his campaign   or at least his businesses are.During the segment, Todd explains that since much of Trump s lavish campaign spending is being spent buying products his and his family s businesses make, or at properties they own, Trump s found a legal way to funnel campaign contributions back into his private business. Rachael Maddow first made the case that Trump s campaign was a money making scheme earlier this week. Now, Todd is making a very similar case, while providing even more examples of Trump s campaign spending. Todd explained: We ll start with Eric Trump s businesses. The Trump campaign paid nearly $5,000 to Eric Trump Wine Manufacturing. It spent over $91,000 to rent out three different Trump golf clubs in Florida for events. $136,000 to Trump restaurants including Trump Grill and Trump Cafe in Trump Tower. Over $420,000 to rent Trump s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. That also doubles as his vacation home.There s been more than $430,000 of Trump campaign money spent on rent at the Trump Tower. Of course, it s his Fifth Avenue skyscraper that does double as Trump s campaign headquarters.And the biggest expense of all has been $4.6 million the campaign has paid to Tag Air, which is the name of Trump s private airline.All told, the campaign has spent over $6 million at Trump-owned businesses out of about $63 million spent through the end of May.So 10 percent of all campaign spending has gone back to Trump or Trump affiliated businesses. Again, none of what Trump is doing is illegal. Todd also points out that while the world was reacting to Brexit, Trump flew to Scotland to promote his new golf course there   hardly offering more than a few idiotic sentiments on one of the biggest political shocks of the 21st century.

That is a fact that cannot be disputed. He has the support of white supremacists and other professional bigots, and yet the GOP elite continue to line up behind him, all while swearing they aren t racists. Well MSNBC political commentator Michael Eric Dyson has had enough.During a conversation with Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, Dyson unloaded and pointed out that Trump is promoting white nationalism during a conversation regarding the United Kingdom s Brexit vote. It is, in fact the same sort of dangerous xenophobia, racism, and nationalism that caused people in Britain to vote pro-Brexit. As we are now seeing, it is not a good thing in the United Kingdom, and that same sort of nationalism that drives Trump s political success is not a good thing here in America either. Here is a transcript of the exchange, via Media Matters:ALEX CASTELLANOS: The Brexit vote is a vote for the idea of nationhood.MICHAEL ERIC DYSON: It s nationalism.CASTELLANOS: Right, in Europe you ve destroyed borders. You can travel anywhere. Immigration has destroyed borders. There are no economic borders now. Greece can spend money that Germany has to pay back. The British looked at this and said, we think being a nation is a good idea and that we ought to be one.DYSON: But nationalism is not the answerCASTELLANOS: Of course it is.DYSON: I m saying nationalism within AmericaCASTELLANOS: There were nations before the EU. There will be nations afterwards. This is not a crisis. And when Donald Trump talks about building a wall  DYSON: For who?CASTELLANOS:   what people are hearing is we ought to have a real nation for all of us.DYSON: Donald Trump s nation doesn t represent all of us. When he keeps saying he wants to ban Muslims. He wants to keep immigrants out. He wants to build a wall. And look, at his rallies, when black people are pushed around, he then says, I will pay for the legal fees. Donald Trump amplifies the worst instincts. And his nationalism is really a white racist supremacist nationalism that reeks terror on the American democratic experiment.Dyson is right. Trump s divisive, violent, racist rhetoric only serves to prey on people s fears, ignorance, and prejudices. It divides rather than unites. Diversity is a beautiful thing, but if Donald Trump has his way, there will be no such thing.Watch the exchange below, again via Media Matters:Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

CNN felt the full force of the outrage during a panel discussion on CNN s Reliable Sources.Before the panel discussion began, host Brian Stelter launched into the controversy surrounding Lewandowski s hiring. Stelter points out that Lewandowski has been consistently hostile to reporters during his job as Trump s campaign manager, he has been accused of battery by former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields   with video evidence to support the claim   and the fact that Lewandowski may very well have signed a non-disclosure agreement with Trump.During the discussion, Baltimore Sun media critic David Zurawik did not hold back his feelings about CNN s newest paid commentator. When asked how he feels about the hiring Zurawik said, I hate it. We are at this time in history where I think a lot of people feel that the media elites and political elites are in bed together and they re the losers. The people in America feel they are the losers. Zurawik says that he thinks that Lewandowski s hiring is particularly troubling to people because he fully embraced the tactics of McCarthyism during his time in the Trump campaign. The other thing I do want to say about getting information about the process from Lewandowski.

Brewer was questioned on how she felt about the president s characterization of Trump. She responded by saying: Obama just always comes tearing after Republicans constantly, calling names and calling people bigots and racists. And that s their big comeback, you know. And it s absolutely ridiculous. To see a president, speak like that is offensive. Former Democrat primary candidate and current governor of Maryland told Brewer that the President wasn t referring to all Republicans when President Obama made the remarks under discussion. O Malley did back up the president s comments, however, saying that: He [President Obama] did say it rightly that Donald Trump is a bigot, Donald Trump is a racist. Donald Trump is, in fact, making fascist appeals. That s why many self-respecting Republicans are not supporting Donald Trump. Brewer claimed that no matter what the topic is, Democrats refuse to talk policy and instead only want to sling accusations of racism and bigotry towards Republicans. The show s host Jake Tapper asked Brewer if she believed that Trump s proposals and remarks are at least somewhat racially motivated. Instead of admitting that it is possible, she simply blamed the things that Trump says that make her  uncomfortable  on his political juvenility.From there, Brewer descends into a full-blown freak out over accusations that Trump and his supporters might just possibly have racist motivations.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Only 41 percent disapprove.The last time President Obama s approval rating was that high was when Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011. It s also worth noting that the President s approval rating was taken in the immediate aftermath of the Orlando shooting, the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.But wait, there s more good news: not only does 56 percent of the American electorate approve of President Obama s presidency overall, 55 percent approve (42 disapprove) of his handling of the economy. Considering Trump likes to paint himself as the  best  man to handle the economy, the news should offer him and his campaign a much needed wake up call.As the Post noted:Obama is more popular now than Republicans George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush in the waning months of their presidencies. Although Obama s approval rating has not reached the level of former Democratic president Bill Clinton s in 2000, his standing suggests that he could be a relatively effective surrogate for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.Just think about it   Clinton already has a huge lead over Trump, and that s before the very popular President Obama has hit the campaign trail. Once Americans see what will be leaving and what might be succeeding them, one could expect to see not only Clinton s poll numbers to rise, but Obama s as well.So what say you, Republicans?

Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Root said to the hosts of Fox and Friends: I wouldn t be surprised if in the last week they ve lost some business. And I m sure it s going to build as the word gets out as we get to the convention and people hear about this terrible, terrible business decision   biased business decision, I think a reckless business decision. And I know that after the Brexit on Friday, Apple stock is very close to their 52-week low. So whether it was me or whether it was word getting out from others or whether it was the Brexit, I know Apple stock isn t doing to good either.Have some patience, I think Apple is going to feel it in the pocketbook eventually. This all comes with Apple s decision to pull out of donating technical supplies and money to the Republican National Convention, all because of controversial presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump. Yes, you read that right. Wayne Allyn Root believes that his feeble campaign against Apple has the power to have this kind of effect on the Global economy. Good luck with that, sir.Even one of the hosts on Fox, Clayton Morris, reminded Root that the folks at Apple likely saw the disassociation from the RNC in the wake of Trump s nomination as a  good business decision.  Root was undeterred, though, and pressed on: As the CEO you can make a personal decision, but you have no right to make a business decision and offend half your customers. Morris also pointed to the fact that Apple has made no comments on the Democratic National Convention, either: We have no word from Apple if they are not going to donate stuff to the DNC also. So, we still don t know the other half of this story. But as you can tell, we have a lot to say about it.The only thing that I know is that this Brexit was all tied into what we re talking about. I think that people all over the world are getting sick of big companies, big corporations and big media and big government all being tied together and making decisions that hurt the people.I think Apple s tied to it. I think the United States government, Obama [is] tied to it. I think Brexit s tied to it. I think it s time for Trexit, which is Donald Trump. So, in other words, this Trump supporting loon s rants were too much even for Fox and Friends, which is definitely saying something. Time for your medication, Mr. Root.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""A devastating new round of political polls shows that Donald Trump is one of the least liked political figures in the United States, and is poised for a loss in this November s presidential election. Polling from multiple media organizations shows Trump in dire straits, with numbers that have to have Republican leaders worried they have to find some way out of nominating the reality TV star.The poll with the best news for Trump comes from NBC/Wall Street Journal. In that poll, Trump is losing by 5% to Hillary Clinton.Forty-six percent of registered voters back Clinton, versus 41 percent who support Trump   slightly up from Clinton s three-point lead in May, 46 percent to 43 percent.When the best news is a margin of defeat larger than Barack Obama had over Mitt Romney (3.9%), you have a problem.Turning to the Washington Post/ABC News poll, things get very bad for Trump, like on the verge of a 1984-style landslide bad. In that poll, Clinton has a 12% lead over Trump. She is ahead 51% to 39% in a poll taken after the mass shooting in Orlando.The key to Trump s poor performance in that poll is the widespread public perception that Trump is biased against Muslims and Latinos, combined with the strong belief that he is just not a credible world leader.Sixty-four percent of Americans now see Trump as unqualified to serve as president, up 6 points from an already-high 58 percent last month. Thirty-four percent see him as qualified.Clinton s numbers are essentially the opposite, and unchanged: Sixty-one percent see her as qualified for the office, 37 percent as not qualified. Moreover, while 33 percent feel strongly that Clinton is not qualified, many more   56 percent   feel strongly that Trump doesn t pass this test.The third piece of evidence that Trump is taking on more water than the Titanic comes from Reuters  poll, where he loses to Clinton by 13%. In that poll 46.6% support Clinton, while only 33.3% back Trump. In their write-up of that poll, Reuters took note of the giant gulf in financial support between the candidates.Campaign finance disclosures released earlier this week showed Trump started June with a war chest of just $1.3 million, a fraction of Clinton s $42 million. Trump sought to ease concerns among his allies by saying that he could tap his  unlimited  personal wealth if needed, and also by bolstering efforts to raise money through fundraising events and online donations.Clintons leads in these polls are notable for a few reasons. They are all headed in the same direction, they all come after a terrorist attack, where many believed that Trump may see an increase in support. And this lead comes as President Obama s approval takes a major uptick (he s headed for Clinton-Reagan type support in his last year) and he has yet to campaign with Clinton along with Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vice President Joe Biden. And finally, Clinton s strong polls come before her campaign and super PACs aligned with it have begun to drop millions of ads in swing states as Trump and the Republican Party remain woefully unprepared and underfunded.It could get much, much worse for Donald Trump.

Arizona officials later announced that the state had discontinued use of the drug altogether.This is good news for opponents of the death penalty. Thanks to their advocacy, the supply of midazolam has all but dried up in Arizona and elsewhere. Better still, Arizona is no longer able to obtain other drugs used in executions, such as pentobarbital and sodium thiopental.In a court filing this week, lawyers for the state basically admitted Arizona s hands are tied. According to the documents, Arizona is not able to execute inmates at this time, due to lack of access to various execution drugs.The last person to be executed in Arizona was Joseph Rudolph Wood. In 2014, Wood was given 15 doses of midazolam along with a pain killer. It took him two hours to die.Following the botched execution, attorney s from the public defender s office filed suit on behalf of Wood and other Arizona inmates. A coalition of media organizations joined in the suit, asking the court to compel the state to fully disclose how it handles executions.In a recent court filing, attorneys for the state of Arizona asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The state claims that the suit is now moot, citing the fact that it is no longer able to carry out executions, due to lack of access to lethal-injection drugs.As Addicting Info reported here, federal authorities busted Arizona officials smuggling illegal drugs into the U.S. in October of last year. Federal agents confiscated an illegal shipment of sodium thiopental at the Phoenix Airport, which Arizona officials spent more than $27,000 of taxpayer money to obtain from Asia.The states of Texas and Nebraska were also busted for smuggling illegal drugs into the country last year.With Arizona s recent decision to discontinue the use of midazolam, the state s lack of access to other death penalty drugs in the U.S., and the federal government blocking attempts to obtain the drugs from overseas, Arizona is officially out of options for killing people.Image credit: Wikimedia Commons""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Having once said that all Muslims should be banned from coming into the United States, Trump has now changed it to only forbidding the Muslims coming from  terror states.

Recently, following the tragic mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, Trump called for a complete immigration ban from countries that have a history of terrorism against America. Along with his new comments on Saturday, Trump was noted saying: We are going to get rid of a lot of bad dudes who are here. That I can tell you.I want terrorists out. I want people that have bad thoughts out. I would limit specific terrorist countries and we know who those terrorist countries are. Some have said that Trump s switch from a religious ban to a regional ban actually makes sense, although in actuality Trump is still doing both. He is still deeply discriminating   he is just using softer, more acceptable language to fluff it up. It s also unclear exactly which countries Trump s new stance will apply to   there are only three counties of the State Department s official list of state sponsors of terrorism: Syria, Iran and Sudan. However, Trump probably hasn t taken into account that terrorist groups often have members in different countries, which can include U.S. allies. But then again, when has Trump ever thought something through?While Trump is now saying that his ban would only apply to Muslims in terror states, Spokesperson Hope Hicks would not say if non-Muslims from those countries or Muslims living in peaceful countries would be exempt from the ban.For all the flip-flopping that Trump does, it s honestly hard to know when to believe him.

A Christian couple is arguing that they should be allowed to not educate their kids because they think Jesus is coming back any day now to take them all to heaven.And the Texas Supreme Court actually agreed with them.According to the Associated Press;Friday s 6-3 decision on technical grounds was a win for Laura and Michael McIntyre, who once educated their nine children in the family s El Paso motorcycle dealership.The couple argued that school district officials violated their 14th Amendment rights by attempting to verify that its children were learning.The district was investigating relatives  complaints the McIntyre children weren t being educated because they were waiting for Jesus Christ s second coming.It all started in 2004 when the religion-obsessed parents took their kids out of their private school to  educate  them at home. But instead of learning math, history, and science the kids were learning all about Jesus and how they ll be raptured.Michael s brother testified that the nine children were never being taught anything that had to do with the school curriculum and that he overheard one of the children informing a cousin that they don t have to learn because the End Times are allegedly near.In their first court appearance, the judge basically laughed at the McIntyres  defense and ruled  in 2014 that: No parents have ever prevailed in any reported case on a theory that they have an absolute constitutional right to educate their children in the home, completely free of any state supervision, regulation, or requirements. They do not have an  absolute constitutional right to home school.

All they have to do now is yank their own kids out of school and claim they have a constitutional right to keep their kids stupid.The Texas Supreme Court basically just ruled in favor of what amounts to child abuse and neglect and the people of Texas should be embarrassed.Featured Image: Wikimedia ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

TransCanada believes that they are owed damages due to provisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Last January, TransCanada made it known that they intended to sue the United States. In response, Sierra Club s executive director Michael Brune released a statement in response to TransCanada s announcement. In the statement, Brune both lambasted TransCanada and urged people to reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that would radically expand corporation s abilities to sue nations in situations similar to this. TransCanada s attempt to make American taxpayers hand over more than $15 billion because the company s dirty Keystone XL pipeline was rejected shows exactly why NAFTA was wrong and why the even more dangerous and far-reaching Trans-Pacific Partnership must be stopped in its tracks. The TPP would empower thousands of new firms operating in the U.S, including major polluters, to follow in TransCanada s footsteps and undermine our critical climate safeguards in private trade tribunals. Today, we have a prime example of how polluter-friendly trade deals threaten our efforts to tackle the climate crisis, spotlighting the need for a new model of trade model that supports rather than undermines climate action. We urge our members of Congress to learn from this historic moment and commit to reject the TPP. Over the course of the Democratic primary, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton spoke out against the TPP. This latest move from TransCanada proves exactly why we need to demand lawmakers reject the TPP. Things right now are not looking good.

That s the choice you face this November,  President Obama said. Between dividing ourselves up, looking for scapegoats, ignoring the evidence, or realizing that we are all stronger together. If we turn against each other, whether it s divisions of race or religion, we re not going to build on the progress we ve started. If we get cynical and just vote our fears or we don t vote at all, we won t build on the progress we ve started. America has been a story of progress but has not gone in a straight line. There have been times when we ve gone forward and there have been times when we ve gone backwards. And what s made the difference each and every time is citizens voting, and caring, and committing to our better selves. In other words, voting matters and it s never been more important to exercise our right to vote than it will be this November.President Obama capped off his speech by slamming the bigoted, divisive, and hateful values of Donald Trump and urged Americans to reject those values for the sake of our children and the future of our country. Coming together around our common values and our faith in hard work and our faith in each other and the belief in opportunity for everybody and assuming the best in each other and not the worst. Because whatever our differences we all love this country and we all care fiercely about our children s futures. And we don t have time for charlatans and we don t have time for hatred and we don t have time for bigotry and we don t have time for film-flam and we don t have the luxury of just popping off and saying just whatever comes to the top of our heads. Don t have time for that. Here s the video via MSNBC.The people of Great Britain made a terrible mistake by voting to exit the European Union. They let fear dictate their decisions and that is incredibly disappointing. America must once again lead by example and reject the fear and xenophobia that is tightening its grip on Europe. We need to be better. The stakes are too high to sit at home on Election Day. We must not give in to the blind fear and hate that Republicans are hoping will give them complete control over the nation. If we do, all the progress we have made over the last century will have been for nothing and the people who want to watch the world burn will achieve their goals.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Democrats staged a sit-in on the House floor, where they demanded that a bill that would prevent persons on the no-fly list from being able to purchase firearms in the United States.One of Maher s guests, Nightly Show host Larry Willmore, was quick to point out that the bill is actually quite  problematic.  It was pointed out that despite the narrative being pushed about preventing terrorist suspects from buying handguns, it isn t actually the no-fly list that the legislation addresses. The no-fly list is actually a subsection of a much larger list called the  Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment,  which includes more than 1,00,000 people s names. One of the people on the list, as Wilmore points out, is actually sit-in leader Representative Jon Lewis himself.It is also pointed out that the majority of people on the list are people of color who have been put on the list without ever having been convicted of a crime to land them on that list. It s actually quite hard to find out if you are on the list and there is no legal procedure to have yourself removed from the list.The panel eventually came to a general consensus that it is ridiculous that a person who is considered a terror suspect should be able to purchase a gun. That being said, the watch list that is being used in the bill (that honestly never had a chance to go anywhere) has a lot of problems as well.What the left needs to keep in mind is that Democrats knew that the GOP would do everything to obstruct this bill, despite it being legislation that Republicans would have jumped on, if we were still living under a George W. Bush administration. What the Democrats involved in the sit-in were looking for was a talking point in the general election. They got it. Republicans put obstructionism above all else. They turned down a watch list that was partly created during a far-right political administration, is rooted in racist mentalities, and at least in name serves to ramp up the military state. If the GOP were going introduce legislation to increase gun regulations, this is what it would look like.You can watch the segment below in full.Featured image from video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Another 20.1 percent said they would support neither candidate.Trump had enjoyed a brief boost in support following the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, as he doubled down on his pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country, cutting Clinton s lead to nine points Clinton s 13.3 percentage point lead is about the same as she had before the Orlando attack.So after exploiting a national tragedy to his advantage, Trump managed to botch even that and now Clinton has settled back into being the obvious frontrunner for the presidency. One of the reasons Trump has now slumped in the polls is that confidence in his campaign is falling. In contrast to Clinton s well oiled money-machine campaign, Trump s reportings of an almost broke campaign has left a bitter taste in voters  mouths.And it would also appear Trump s hackneyed racism and Islamophobia is getting boring with voters. Unlike his heightened popularity in the wake of San Bernardino, Trump s numbers declined after doubling down to ban Muslims from entering the country.And these feelings are all across the country. The poll measured 1,200 respondents from all 50 states.But another telling number from the poll is that 20 percent of the American public said they will not be backing either candidate.He s broke, he s fired his campaign manager, he has less than 100 staffers across the country, and now he s losing in the polls   badly. President Obama s approval rating is in the steady mid-50s, so he s certainly not unpopular.

Not by far.The main problem is that the state cut taxes to try and turn Kansas into the bastion of business and tourism that Texas and Florida supposedly are, but that failed miserably and now the state is worse than broke. To fight to get Kansas back on track, former Democratic governors Kathleen Sebelius and John Carlin are joined by former Republican governors Mike Hayden and Bill Graves, and all four are working to educate Kansas  public about what s actually happening versus what Brownback wants people to think is happening.They can t even fund their schools halfway properly because their budget is such a mess.The Save Kansas Coalition wants balanced taxes, high-quality public education, and access to healthcare, along with judicial impartiality, safer highways, and job growth. Brownback s policies are not conducive to any of this. He s a hardcore, balanced-budget, cutting-taxes-will-stimulate-the-economy-so-we-can-balance-the-budget Republican who doesn t get it.In fact, his policies have driven some business out of the state. One such business owner, Jeff Blackwood, is working to relocate his business onto the Missouri side of Kansas City, saying: I can t, in good conscience, continue to give our tax money to a government that actively works against needs of its citizens We take care of people here and that is exactly the opposite of what is occurring. The funding problems have led to the closure of a mental health hospital and a state rehab office for the disabled, not to mention what s happening with the school system there. Brownback s spokesperson said that his policies have led to five straight years of business growth, and yet, the state is floundering horrifically.Brownback and the Republicans in the state legislature don t seem to realize that cutting taxes means taxes get cut, which causes budget shortfalls, which snowballs into a bankrupt state if it s not quickly addressed. Back in November, Kansas was looking at having a whopping $5.6 million in cash reserves. In other words, peanuts, because the projected tax revenue just wasn t there.The Save Kansas Coalition wants people to be aware of how serious their votes are. Brownback and company didn t get into office by accident   the people of Kansas voted for these policies. If they vote to re-elect these ignorant pusnoodles, they ll be voting for more of the same problems since Brownback can t admit that he screwed everything up, and as such, will continue to beat this particular dead horse no matter what.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Simple fixes like universal background checks and banning terrorist suspects from buying guns legally would have satisfied most Americans.But because Republicans are owned by the NRA they refused to act and now all gun owners are paying the price for their failure to be responsible.Hawaii has the lowest gun death rate of any state in the nation and the island chain s strict gun laws are the main reason why.And now Governor David Ige has signed three bills that take gun regulations to another level.Introduced by Democratic state Rep. Will Espero, SB 2954 requires police to place the names of gun owners in the state in the FBI monitoring database so that law enforcement in Hawaii will be informed if any of their residents commit a crime wherever they go in the United States. So if a Hawaiian commits a crime in New York the police in Hawaii will be notified so they can determine if that person should still get to be in possession of firearms.In addition, HB 625 stalking and sexual harassment now disqualify people who commit these crimes from buying guns and HB 2632 requires people who have been diagnosed with major mental disorders to surrender their guns to authorities.In all, these three measures make it clear that Hawaii is done taking shit from the NRA.Of course, it didn t take long for the NRA to whine about the bills. The NRA Institute for Legislative Action, which really should change that last word to  Inaction,  predictably condemned the new laws. The exercise of an individual s Second Amendment rights is not inherently suspicious and should not require a person to surrender other civil liberties, including unwarranted invasions of privacy or unequal treatment under the law. The lawful acquisition, possession, carrying, or use of a firearm does not justify subjecting citizens to ongoing monitoring. Sorry, NRA. But that s what happens when you refuse to do anything reasonable to prevent gun violence other than offering  thoughts and prayers.  If you can t agree on anything to keep guns solely in the hands of responsible citizens, the government has the power and the right to do it without your support.NRA spokesperson Amy Hunter complained that the laws go too far, which is coming from an organization that believes ANY law restricting guns goes too far. As you can imagine, the NRA finds this one of the most extreme bills we ve ever seen,  she whined.At this point, if the NRA and their Republican puppets continue to refuse to do anything reasonable to reduce gun violence in this country, the states should do whatever it takes to make everyone as safe from gun violence as possible, even if it means putting every gun owner on an FBI list.

Anti-Trump delegates, concerned for the future of their party (and their power), are requesting a rule change for the convention that will allow delegates pledged to Trump to opt out, and instead vote their conscience.In other words, this rule change would turn every delegate into a super delegate.The letter, sent by Colorado delegate Kendal Unruh, asked the committee to adopt a  conscience clause  into the rules, thus circumventing the delegate rules and procedures set up by the states:If any such delegate notifies the secretary of his or her intent to cast a vote of conscience, whether personal or religious, each such delegate shall be unbound and unconstrained by these rules on any given vote, including the first ballot for the selection of the president of the United States, without the risk of challenge, sanction or retribution by the Republican National Committee (RNC).The letter went on to justify how a delegate, who is bound by the rules of the state to represent the will of the people, could possibly decide they want to vote another way:Allowable personal reasons shall include the public disclosure of one or more any grievous acts of personal conduct by a nominee candidate, including but not limited to, criminally actionable acts, acts of moral turpitude or extreme prejudice, and/or notorious public statements of support for positions that clearly oppose or contradict the policies embodied in the Republican Party s platform as established at the national convention.So far, 30 delegates have been in the works to thwart the presumptive nominee, but a rule change from the RNC could spur more action if delegates felt, all of a sudden, a change of conscience.Running a group called the Free the Delegates, Unruh is hoping to secure a majority vote from the 112 member Rules Committee.Such an action would expose a very real and very damning rift within the Republican party.

The investigation also revealed that some of the soldiers allowed the  prostitutes  to enter a room with weapons and secret documents.A second investigation was opened after authorities found evidence of drug use by at least one of the soldiers.In February, WSMV reported that the Tennessee National Guard promotes individuals who have engaged in serious misconduct violations. Video published here shows two Guardsmen being pulled over by the TN Highway Patrol for DUI. These men should have been removed from duty, but were promoted instead.During an interview with WSMV, Carter blasted TN National Guard Leadership, saying: I m out, so I don t have anything to lose.

Trump and others like him spewing hate speech, prejudice is reaching new levels. It s visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray. It makes me afraid for my family. It also makes no sense. He explains that he s the son of Muslim immigrants, and how his family is now told to be careful in how they worship. Also explaining, that as American citizens, that is absolutely awful. We have the freedom of religion in this nation, and everyone has a right to worship how they so choose on their own time.Ansari wrote that despite not being religious himself, even looking like you might be Muslim can make you a target of discrimination: There is a strange feeling that you must almost prove yourself worthy of feeling sad and scared like everyone else. He added: The vitriolic and hate-filled rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump isn t so far off from cursing at strangers from a car window. He has said that people in the American Muslim community  know who the bad ones are,  implying that millions of innocent people are somehow complicit in awful attacks. Not only is this wrongheaded; but it also does nothing to address the real problems posed by terrorist attacks. By Mr. Trump s logic, after the huge financial crisis of 2007-08, the best way to protect the American economy would have been to man white males. Is Ansari right in telling Trump to  go f*ck himself ?? Absolutely. Trump is personally attacking Ansari and his family and is just so absolutely wrong about the Muslim faith and community.Trump s tactic of divide and conquer, putting himself and his white pride fanatics against anyone who doesn t fit the mold of what he sees fit to live in the United States, isn t only bigoted, but just outright dangerous.Good on Ansari for speaking out and calling Trump out on his bigotry.Featured Photos by John Moore/Getty Images and Gary Gershoff/Getty Images for Peabody ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Appearing at his golf course in Scotland, Trump held a press conference a few hours after the outcome of the British referendum was clear.Instead, the presumptive Republican nominee completely botched the media availability. Instead of talking up his sympathies with the right-wing movement that got the referendum passed, Trump instead babbled on about his golf course, the views from the course, and so forth. When he was asked about the Brexit, Trump continued to bumble. He could only talk about the tumbling global markets from the perspective of how his golf course would make money, instead ignoring the pensions being wiped out in the U.K. and the effect it could have on the American economy, including retirees with their money in the market.In response, Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign released a devastating web video that laid out the seriousness of the moment and Trump s utter failure to present any sort of leadership.Hours after the #BrexitVote, Donald Trump was in the U.K.Talking about how he, personally, would benefit.https://t.co/YEt5LozDpt  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 24, 2016The video also makes it clear how lost Trump is without his teleprompter.

He can t back up what he s saying, and more often than not he is obviously, blatantly, comically, making things up. The only time Trump can appear remotely competent is when his words are written down for him.Unfortunately for him, he has to focus so much on keeping it in check on prompter that he loses all the enthusiasm and rabble-rousing that has made him so popular with nativist supporters during the campaign.

President Barack Obama s presidency has been a major threat to those intolerant values, as marriage equality was finally legalized in all 50 states during his second term. Obama is still this nation s voice of equality, and today marks yet another tremendous win for the LGBT community.On Friday, Obama announced that the Stonewall Inn will become the first LGBT-dedicated National Monument. The Stonewall Inn is a historic landmark, and was the site of the 1969 riots that kicked off the gay rights movement. In releasing the news that the Stonewall Inn will be named a National Historic Monument, the White House released a powerful video, which announces that the Stonewall Inn will be the first official National Park Service unit dedicated to telling the story of LGBT Americans, just days before the one year anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality in all 50 states. In the video, Obama delivers a message that is going to have Republicans fuming once again: I believe our national parks should reflect the full story of our country, the richness and diversity and uniquely American spirit that has always defined us: that we are stronger together, that out of many, we are one. The Stonewall National Monument covers almost 8 acres in New York s Greenwich Village, including the Stonewall Inn   the site where LGBT patrons fought police persecution. Obama spoke on the police raids in the video, and noted how the gay bar deserved a place in American history: Raids like these were nothing new, but this time the patrons had had enough. So they stood up and spoke out. The riots became protests. The protests became a movement. The movement ultimately became an integral part of America. Also in the video are the words of LGBT activist Eunic Ortiz, who said: The Stonewall riots in 1969, I think, obviously was a very pivotal point in our history. It was when we all stood up, and a trans woman of color said,  Enough is enough,  and it started a movement. And it started a movement that said,  We re not less than you. We are your equals. You can watch the powerful video below:In a press release, the White House said: Although the LGBT civil rights movement has made significant progress in the pursuit of equal rights and protections under the law, there is still more work to do. As seen two weeks ago in Orlando, FL, LGBT Americans continue to face acts of violence, discrimination, and hate. LGBT people of color are especially at risk. The Administration is committed to continuing the fight for dignity, acceptance and equal rights for all Americans   no matter who they are or who they love. Even decades after the riots, the bar has continued to be an attraction for gay rights activists   last year, after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, LGBT activists gathered there in celebration. Recently, following the tragic mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier this month, mourners gathered at the site.Judging from conservatives  reactions to the news, the GOP isn t taking this very well:YahooYahooYahooYahooMediaiteMediaiteBy now we know that if conservatives are getting this angry over something, that must mean that some real progress in America is being made. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), who helped lead the effort, said: Stonewall is finally taking its rightful place in American history. We are faced with painful reminders daily of how much further we must go to achieve true equality and tolerance for the LGBT community, but honoring and preserving the stories of all of the diverse participants in Stonewall in our National Park System is a clear symbol of how far we have come.

The good news is that there s 50 less pedophiles in this world, because, you know, these homosexuals are a bunch of disgusting perverts and pedophiles,  Anderson said in a video posted to YouTube the day after the shooting. But these people all should have been killed, anyway, but they should have been killed through the proper channels, as in they should have been executed by a righteous government that would have tried them, convicted them, and saw them executed. Because, in Leviticus 20:13, God s perfect law, he put the death penalty on murder, and he also put the death penalty on homosexuality. That s what the Bible says, plain and simple. Now karma is kicking his ass and he isn t happy about it.As it turns out, Anderson and his congregation at the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Phoenix do business with other people both online and in brick and mortar establishments. That means these businesses can be informed about who they are doing business with and they re not too interested in doing business with a bigot who wants to commit mass murder.Paypal and Apple are among many businesses that have terminated the accounts of Anderson, his church, and the other bigoted pastors who foolishly followed his lead in calling for executing gay people.And like a child being denied candy by his parents in the middle of a supermarket, Anderson literally threw a temper tantrum about it during a sermon. It s war. You know what the filthy sodomites have done toward our church and us, and our friends and our fellow pastors that actually have the guts to say what needs to be said? Here s what they ve done in the last few weeks. They got our PayPal account shut down so that we can t take anymore online donations. We set up with another company, GivLet, they got that shut down. Qgiv, they got that shut down. BitPay, they got that shut down. They shut down our iTunes podcast. They shut down Brother Jimenez s PayPal account. They shut down Brother Romero s PayPal account  The landlord of Pastor Jimenez is saying,  hey we re not going to renew your lease. Romero and Jimenez both praised the Orlando mass shooting and called for gay people to be executed across the country. I mean these people are dedicated,  Anderson continued.  These people are researching, they re finding out where we bank, they re finding out who we do business with. They re trying to get us shut down on all fronts, and you know what, let me tell you something, I m sick of it. Then he leaped atop his podium and began screaming at his congregation telling them if they don t agree with him they should leave and proceeded to call LGBT people  dogs. And you know what, if you re not gonna back us up then get out of here, we don t need your help,  he said.  I don t want to hang around with a bunch of fag hags and a bunch of queer baits and a bunch of effeminates. GET OUT! They re sodomites! They re dogs! DOGS!

You could take  Britain  out and replace it with  Texas . You could take  EU  out and replace it with  US . You could take  Brussels  out and replace it with  Washington DC . You could give you guys a nice Texas drawl and no one would know any different. So much of it is exactly the same. The vast majority of the laws, rules and regulations that affect the people of Texas are created by the political class or un-elected bureaucrats in Washington,  he continued.It s not likely that Texas will be able to secede, however. Shortly after the Civil War, the Supreme Court ruled in Texas v. White:When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States. There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States.In short, the only way Texas can secede is if a majority of the states agree to let Texas do so.And perhaps it s time to let them.The Republican Party would suffer a serious blow if Texas exited the Union. Texas has 38 electoral votes and sends 36 representatives to Congress, 25 of whom are Republicans. The two Senators Texas sends to Congress are also Republicans. So not only would Democrats win the presidency handily, they could take back the House and the Senate.Furthermore, the United States government could stop sending federal dollars to Texas.You can also bet that conservatives would flock to Texas in search of a conservative paradise.And when the new country of Texas becomes a failed state, we can just build a wall around it and let them deal with their own mess instead of coming to their rescue again as America did in 1845 when Texas begged for entrance into the United States because it was in severe debt.It s time to cut the cord, America. Texas has been dragging this country down for too long. We survived as a nation for nearly 100 years without Texas. We didn t need Texas then. We definitely do not need Texas now. The Republican Party needs Texas, but we don t. So let s kill two birds with one stone and let Texas go. Because once Texas goes, so goes the Republican Party. Texas entered this country in what they call a  marriage of convenience.  This would just be a divorce of convenience, except that America would finally progress into the future we deserve while Texas continues to go backwards.Featured image via Wikimedia  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The UK s Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would be resigning.

He even had campaign billboards put up that said,  Make America White Again,  around Benton, Tenn. Tyler claims that he s got no hatred for people of color. He just wants America to go back to a  1960s, Ozzie and Harriet, Leave it to Beaver time when there were no break-ins; no violent crime; no mass immigration. Right, there s totally no racism there. We re sure some of his best friends are people of color, too. He thinks that white people are the architects of advanced society, so elevating white people is the best way to  make America great again. He also had a billboard up that was a picture of the White House ringed with Confederate flags, which said,  I have a dream.  For someone who allegedly isn t racist, he certainly enjoys racist sayings and symbols, and implying that people who aren t white are responsible for all our ills today.To co-opt one of the most famous messages from one of the most famous civil rights leaders in American history for his racist agenda is just vile.How does Trump fit into this, besides his rampant, blatant racism? Tyler wrote the following on his website: [T]he Trump phenomenon has and will continue to produce spin off effects and fall out that can be beneficially seized upon by the elect remnant of the God of Scriptures. In our present political season the dominant presence of Donald Trump has served to open us channels of discourse and dialogue that have previously been off limits. His advocacy of a  temporary ban  on Muslim immigration and the construction of a wall on the Southern border have created a climate conducive to conversation relative to the elephant in the living room no one wants to talk about namely, the urgent and vital subject of race. There it is, the hatred and fear of  political correctness  that pervades the thinking of these racists. They believe it s not racist at all to say that race plays a role in America s downfall, and imply that whites are the only race capable of restoring us to our former glory. Nope. It s just  telling it like it is,  and Tyler seems to have embraced that Trumpian mentality wholeheartedly.The signs have been taken down, but Tyler didn t do it.

The on-duty officer followed Jacquez to his house. He shot him in the back as his mother was opening the door.While Ashby claimed that Jacquez had  mouthed off  to him during the stop, witness testimony contradicted his version of events.As New York Daily News reported in February, 2015:The brother of a police officer who was on a ride-along with Ashby that night, Kyle Moore, contradicted Ashby s account. He said Jacquez did not talk back to Ashby and walked straight from the street to a side entrance to his house, where his mother opened the door for him.Ashby also claimed that Jacquez produced a baseball bat from the house and attempted to swing it at him. The coroner s report showed that the man could not have been in an attack position when Ashby fired his weapon.Ashby was the first Colorado police officer to be charged with murder associated with an on-duty incident in more than 20 years.On the same day the Colorado jury convicted Ashby, two other widely recognized cases involving law enforcement officers were also decided. Those cases had much different outcomes.On Thursday, Baltimore police officer Caesar Goodson Jr. was acquitted of all charges associated with the in-custody death of 27-year old Freddie Gray.The news of Goodson s acquittal was followed by news that a Texas judge declined to charge officer Eric Casebolt for his actions at a pool party last summer.

As Republicans went to lunch and then continued on with their lives without a care in the world, Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) led Democrats in staging a 25-hour sit-in on the House of Representatives floor in protest.The GOP s reaction to this powerful protest has been just as disappointing as its response to senseless gun violence. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan commented on the sit-in and called it a  publicity stunt and a cry for  attention.  Now, a radio host for the National Rifle Association has taken those comments a step further and compared the Democrats fighting to protect Americans from gun violence to  criminals and terrorists. On the NRA s radio show Cam & Company, host Cam Edwards claimed that just like terrorists and criminals, the Democrats participating in the sit-in were not following rules. He said: So in order to push legislation that the sponsors say would not have prevented the attacks in Orlando, Florida, they re also going to flout the House rules. Kind of like, you know, criminals and terrorists flout the rules that we have in place right now and will continue to do so? Edwards also said that those Democrats were  in violation of House rules on photography  because they continued to post the event after House Republicans turned off C-SPAN cameras.To make Edwards  comments even more infuriating, he actually tried to educate Rep. Lewis, who is a civil rights legend, on civil rights movements. Edwards whitesplained the Democrats  sit-in: I don t know what to call it, a sit-in, again, generally speaking we saw the sit-ins in the civil rights movement that were advocating for individuals being able to enjoy the same rights that other Americans enjoyed, right? That s what the protests were, that s what   we re sitting at this lunch counter and we re not leaving until we get served. Not we re sitting at this lunch counter and we re not leaving until you remove this item from the menu.We re going to sit right here and we re not leaving until you recognize us as human beings, as Americans who have the same rights that that guy has over there and that she has over there. That s what the sit-ins were about in the civil rights movement. This, on the other hand, this isn t Congress demanding more rights for Americans, this isn t Congress demanding rights for themselves, this is Congress demanding power. These are House Democrats demanding the authority and the power to ignore the Fifth Amendment when they see fit, to view the Bill of Rights as an impediment to lawmakers, to treat it as such and to try to degrade. Kind of like what they say with ISIS right? Blind white privilege is an ugly, terrifying thing. You can watch Edwards  disgusting comments below:No matter what the GOP serves up, Lewis and his fellow Dems have vowed to keep the pressure on the Republicans to change gun laws.

Fisher, who scored in the top 12 percent, felt she was unfairly denied even though she had 1180 out of 1600 on her SAT, and volunteered for Habitat for Humanity.In other words, she felt entitled. And, whenever a white person is a  victim  of  discrimination,  they want to cry  racism  and throw everyone else under the bus.This decision was the second time the Supreme Court took up the case. The first time, the Court sent the case back to the lower system for further review. When the same conclusion was met, the Court agreed to hear it once more. The first time, however, all Justices except for Ginsburg agreed (Kagan, again, recused herself). Ginsburg s dissent chided the Court for ignoring precedence and racial history:Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a dissenting opinion in which she argued that the University s admission policy treats race as merely one factor in the overall decision to admit a student, which is permissible under previous judicial precedent. She also argued that the Equal Protection Clause does not require that state universities be blind to the history of overt discrimination and that it is preferable that they explicitly include race as a factor in admission decisions rather than attempt to obfuscate its role.The Supreme Court made a surprising decision today. However, if Scalia was on the Court and still Kagan recused herself, the decision would have been split and the outcome would have been the same.In this case, justice would have prevailed anyway.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Only Congress has the power to declare war. The president does not have that power. In order for President Obama to take on ISIS with the full resources and military strength of the Unites States, Congress must declare war.But so far, Republicans have been cowards and refused to do so, instead claiming that President Obama already has the power to go full throttle against what they claim is our most dangerous enemy today.If ISIS is such a big threat, then why not declare war?That was CNN host Chris Cuomo s question when he grilled GOP Rep. Sean Duffy on Thursday.Duffy claimed that President Obama has not done enough to defeat and destroy ISIS, including saying the magic words  radical Islamic terrorism,  and said that Republicans should hold a sit-in protest at the White House demanding he take more action. Our generals say we could take out ISIS in weeks if not months,  Duffy declared. However, that s because there would have to be ground troops involved, which means war.Duffy claimed that President Obama is responsible for the Orlando mass shooting because he hasn t pursued ISIS enough even though airstrikes have killed thousands of ISIS fighters since the terrorist organization began their rampage across the Middle East.Cuomo replied by pointing out that Republicans in Congress have the power to help President Obama prosecute the fight against ISIS but don t want to be held responsible for sending troops into battle. I don t know what you re asking for that isn t done right now,  Cuomo said.  The generals do say they can take out ISIS, but we know what they re asking for: They re asking for boots on the ground. You re part of a Congress that won t even have a vote on the authorization for use of military force against ISIS. Duffy claimed that President Obama has the  all the authority he needs  because of the power Congress gave President Bush over ten years ago. The problem, however, is that those authorizations were to fight al-Qaeda in response to the 9/11 attacks and Congress has changed significantly since then. Most of the members serving now were not around at that time. If it matters so much, why not take control of it with the power that s yours?  Cuomo asked. Duffy claimed that he would  gladly  do it.Cuomo slammed Duffy by noting that Republicans never give President Obama blanket power. All they do is obstruct him from doing anything, yet they have no problem with him overstepping his constitutional authority to wage war against an enemy Congress has not declared war on.Duffy then changed the subject back to guns and why we shouldn t do anything to prevent terrorists from legally buying guns to commit mass shootings.Here s the video via YouTube.To be blunt, Republicans have been looking for any reason to impeach President Obama ever since he first took office. So far, they haven t found any legitimate reason or they would have done it already. And that s why it s important to question why Republicans won t declare war and why they are demanding that President Obama do more against ISIS.If President Obama listened to Republicans and began waging war against ISIS complete with the use of thousands of ground troops, they would crucify him for overstepping the authority of Congress and violating the Constitution and the separation of powers. They would then be able to legitimately claim that President Obama abused his power and could then impeach him.That is the only logical reason why Republicans are so insistent that President Obama unilaterally go to war against ISIS. But President Obama is smarter than they are and has refused to take the bait.If Republicans really want America to do more in the fight against ISIS the answer is simple. They should use their constitutional authority to declare war instead of being cowards.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Obama wants to be a businessman, maybe.The Obama family will be staying in Washington, D.C., at least for the foreseeable future, but that doesn t mean Obama s post-White House activities have to be limited to the nation s capital. Like all great American pioneers, Obama is looking west   this time, toward Silicon Valley, not Wall Street. In an interview with Bloomberg, Obama said: Well, I ve said this before and, I think, surprised a lot of people, but if I think about what would stir my passions had I not gone into politics, it d probably be starting some kind of business. The skill set of starting my presidential campaigns and building the kinds of teams that we did and marketing ideas I think would be the same kinds of skills that I would enjoy exercising in the private sector. The President was careful not to repeat the Republican talking point, that business skill somehow translates to running a country: Now, I m always careful about drawing too many easy parallels there, because sometimes there are CEOs who come in and start explaining to me how I should be running the presidency. And I sometimes have to stop them and say,  All right. One, I appreciate your advice. But imagine a situation in which half your board and management were actively trying to get rid of you and prevent you from accomplishing anything. And you had 2 million employees, and you couldn t fire a large portion of them. And your competitors weren t simply promoting their own products, but were continually saying how your products were the worst that were ever invented and will cause a civilizational crisis. If you pull that all together, then you ve got about half of what I m dealing with on a daily basis.' As for the type of business, Obama wants to help the world. He is interested in science and medicine. Like Bill Gates, Obama wants to use capitalism to try to save the world, one small project at a time. You can become Bill Gates. Or, in some cases, you can electrify a village. You can save water in a desert. That s the thing about the U.S. economy that continues to be unique. And it s tied to capitalism and markets, but it s also tied to a faith in science and reason and a mindset that says there s always something new to discover, and we don t know everything, and we re going to try new things, and we re pragmatic. And if we ever lose that, then we will have lost what has made us an incredible force for good in the world. If we sustain it, then we can maintain the kind of progress that has been made. I always tell interns and young people who I talk to that as tough as things seem right now, do not believe people when they tell you they wish they could go back to the good old days. Because the good old days aren t I m now old enough where I remember some of those good old days. While Obama s plans might not be locked in yet, we can be sure of one thing, he won t let his time go to waste painting pictures of feet or living on the golf course. Former Democratic presidents get s*it done, and Obama will be no exception. The right will hate whatever he does, though.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla at Getty Images.

R. Martin, King briefly talked about about gun violence in the wake of the Orlando mass shooting in which 49 people were killed and over 50 were wounded.King suggested that shooters like Omar Mateen and Dylann Roof are at least partially driven to commit their heinous crimes by the media because they are looking for fame and the media always talks about the body count as if they are keeping score. In addition, the shooters end up getting their very own Wikipedia page and their photos are plastered on the news for days or even weeks after their crimes.King said that these shooters start out as  nobodies  and that they see committing a mass shooting as a way to gain notoriety. A lot of these guys are nobodies who see their way to some kind of stardom by creating an act of mass terror. And, of course, the sad thing about this is that we remember the killers long after their victims are forgotten, and that s one of the things that makes this a self-perpetuating act. I would argue that someone like the man who shot all these people in Orlando, he may have pledged allegiance to ISIS but before that he was a spouse abuser and somebody with a lot of anger. And I think that in a lot of cases these acts are perpetrated by people who may put some political icing on the cake, but basically they re just f*cking crazy. Indeed, and those  f*cking crazy  people are able to legally buy assault weapons, which King pointed out will continue to lead to more mass shootings as long as we allow people access to them. If that guy had gone in there with a knife he would have been overpowered before he had stabbed more than four people. As long as anybody who s got only two wheels on the road can walk into a store and buy a f*cking killing machine like an AR-15 or something, this is just going to go on. It s really up to us. Here s the video via YouTube. King s remarks on gun violence begin at the 40 minute mark.Stephen King is absolutely right and his point is illustrated perfectly by Australia.

Jackie Speier, a progressive Democrat, brought a unique perspective to the historic House sit-in initiated by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis. As members of the House read the stories and names of countless victims of gun violence, Congresswoman Speier told her own story, a story that would shake anyone to their core.But with her speech, she also brought something special with her on the House floor: the bullet the almost killed her.In 1978, Speier, at that time a Congressional aide to Rep. Leo Ryan, accompanied the Congressman and several others to Jonestown to investigate human rights abuses at the hands of cult leader Jim Jones. Upon leaving the encampment, Speier and the others were ambushed in a guerilla attack from members of the cult. Congressman Ryan was killed, along with five others, and Speier was shot five times. She waited 22 hours for help to arrive.This issue was so personal to the Congresswoman that she flew back to D.C. from California just to be in solidarity with her colleagues and the thousands of victims all across the country. Holding up the bullet, still in its FBI evidence bag, Congresswoman Speier laid out just how personal and important this fight is not just for her, but for everyone who has ever been a victim of gun violence:This was taken from my body. Five bullets ripped through my body. I can t begin to tell you what that is like. I can tell you what it s like to live with a disfigured body the rest of your life. I can tell you that this dumdum and my disfigured body are things that remind me each and everyday why what do here now is so important. We cannot continue as business as usual.The Congresswoman, who keeps the bullet in her drawer, has never showed the public before. The act drew gasps from her colleagues, but praise for her act of courage.While Republicans went and smoked cigars, Democrats stood up, and some relived tragedy, like Speier and Rep. Debbie Dingell, a victim of domestic abuse with a gun. The House sit in sums up perfectly the old saying: a liberal says  This should never happen to anyone, and that s why I care. A conservative says,  This hasn t happened to me, so I don t care. Speier lived through the most horrific tragedy, and that s why she cares.

Knowing their own kids could be next, they still decided it wasn t worth the effort.Then Orlando happened. The worst mass shooting in American history, and still no action from the GOP-controlled Congress.So Democrats decided to do a classic sit-in. Walk in, sit down, and refuse to leave until something, anything, was done to curb America s gun violence epidemic. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are standing their ground on the House floor and refuse to budge, even as the House adjourns for a weeks long recess.Giffords, who is no longer a member of Congress, has written an open letter of solidarity with her former colleagues:Dear Member of the House and former colleagues:There is nowhere I would rather be right now than with you on the floor of the People s House, representing Southern Arizona, fighting for our country, and working to make our communities safer. But your action is the balm for my regret and it is the inspiration for my continued commitment.Fighting gun violence takes great courage. I ve seen great courage when my life was on the line. I see great courage in many of you right now.Americans are grappling with a gun violence crisis. It is a crisis that tears apart the lives of so many Americans and touches every community. It is both public and private. In our homes and on our streets. At work, at church, at the movies, at a dance club, at school and at school again, at a Congress on Your Corner. The victims are young and old but always with so much life ahead of them. They are white and black, Latino and Asian, and Native American. They are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and straight. They are Christian and Muslim, Jewish and Sikh. They are veterans and government workers and union members. They are rich and poor. They die by murder, they die by suicide, and they die by negligence. Often, they don t die, but they carry the scars, and their lives change forever.If gun violence affects all of us Americans, then the solution is not up to just some of us. We are all responsible for our safety today and for the country we pass on to our children tomorrow. It s what makes us a country. Where our country has already come together behind the simple proposition that we ought to have laws that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people so must our Congress. And they should not waste another minute.We must not accept the world that will be the product of inaction in Washington. We can do better. Some states have already made progress they show us that when we put aside our incidental or momentary differences and stand shoulder to shoulder, we have enormous power.It s been said that hope was forged of two powerful ingredients: anger at how things are, and the courage to change them. We will not be driven backwards to live in isolation from one another and in fear of violence.Thanks to you and millions of Americans who share our values of pluralism, liberty, and responsibility we will stand strong and work toward a safer nation for all of us.Speaking is difficult for me. But I haven t been silenced. And neither should the American people. Their Representatives must vote to prevent gun violence.Sincerely,Gabrielle GiffordsIn an emotional tribute, Gifford s best friend, Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, read the letter to her House colleagues in the well of the House, as Republicans sat in their offices, contemplating what to do next.Fixing America s violent obsession with guns has become Giffords  life mission. Along with her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, Giffords and thousands of parents of children lost to gun violence are rising up and taking on the NRA head by storm. Unmoved by temporary setbacks (at the hands of cowardly Republican Senators), the mobilization of Giffords  efforts is gaining traction all across the country, with Democrats and Republicans alike who agree on one thing   no brainer gun reform: stricter background checks, no fly no buy, and no weapons for abusers and haters.While the Republicans close the doors, shut off the lights and collect their NRA checks, Democrats stand firm and stand with the people.We all stand in solidarity with Giffords, House Democrats, and the millions of people affected by gun violence here in the United States and abroad.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In saying this, Ryan has completely ignored the fact that there have been several mass shootings in the United States that have zero connection to terrorism and were caused by individuals that never should have been able to get their hands on a gun so effortlessly.To prove just how backwards Ryan s  logic  is, he accused the hard-working Democrats fighting for gun control legislation of doing the sit-in for  attention  instead of creating solutions (clearly, he forgot that his GOP colleagues were EATING LUNCH while this was happening   which definitely doesn t solve anything).

Wes Gullet, another partner in the company and a former Phoenix mayoral candidate, echoed Noble s shock at the results: It s shocking to think that a Democratic presidential candidate would carry Arizona if the election were held today, considering that every statewide office in Arizona is held by a Republican as well as significant majorities in the Arizona House and Senate.

The study was a correction to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which reported inaccurate spending predictions based on a flawed view of consumer spending and attributes of the landmark healthcare law:When CMS originally made those projections, they really thought the slowdown in health-care spending [growth] was mostly due to the recession, and afterward we d see a return to the higher rates of spending growth   and that didn t really happen.Although Obamacare isn t completely responsible for the slow in healthcare spending, the study does note that that the healthcare law and the  ripple effect  of its policies are having an effect with Medicaid and other programs that is causing more financial stability in the markets.The hospital readmissions program (which is covered by federal reimbursements) saw a sharp decline in these rates once Obamacare came into law, saving the country billions. That s just one example of how the healthcare law has been saving the government tons of money it otherwise would have been throwing away for frivolous expenditures.So, in other words, the process may be cyclical, but Obamacare is certainly speeding it up (or slowing down the costs, in this case).The Kaiser Foundation, in 2013, also came to the conclusion:The hangover from the Great Recession has had significant effects on consumer spending in general, and health spending specifically   [The Affordable Care Act] has clearly had a large and direct effect on slowing down health spending in Medicare. Its effect on the rest of the health system is somewhat more speculative, but I believe it s real.Only one thing is for absolute certain: Obamacare has no skyrocketed healthcare spending. It may not be the only thing slowing it, but it certainly isn t bloating the budget.So when Republicans scream that the healthcare law will add to the deficit, add to the debt, created a bloated budget, or anything else they want to throw out in the air, the should read this study.All the doom and gloom the GOP has peddled for the last six years has shown to be nothing but right-wing conspiracy talk, drummed up to instill fear in people who are scared of a  socialist  takeover of healthcare.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Two of them produced pay stubs to support their claims.Trump s refurbishment of the Romanesque pile, built in 1899, into a luxury hotel is his highest-profile real estate project, if only because the historic structure is situated just a few blocks from the White House. Trump staged a campaign event at the construction site in March, blending presidential politics with commerce.  When it s completed,  he said,  it will be truly one of the great hotels of the world. Trump s contract with the federal government for the site is actually structured so that Trump is actually leasing it from the government. That means wages on the site are set by federal law, which requires all workers   union or not   on the site to be paid the  prevailing wage  set in the area by labor unions.A sign at the Trump site pointed out that glaziers, the workers installing shower doors, should be paid between $24.30 to $27.64 an hour. But their paystubs show them earning way less   between $13 to $16 an hour   almost half of what the law requires.Trump has been slammed recently for repeatedly underpaying contractors who have done work on his properties, and in some instances not paying them at all for the work they ve done for him and his companies. Trump claimed that he was completely justified in stiffing workers.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

John Lewis, Democrats were preparing to hold a sit-in when Texas congressman and NRA shill Ted Poe called for a recess. We have been too quiet for too long,  Lewis declared.  There comes a time when you have to say something. You have to make a little noise. You have to move your feet. This is the time. Lewis and 60 Democratic colleagues sat on the House floor, recited the Pledge of Allegiance, and chanted,  no bill, no break.  But Republicans called for a break anyway and then they censored the sit-in by literally shutting off the video feed that allows Americans to see what is happening in the people s House.Here s the video via YouTube.Afterwards, Rep. Karen Bass told MSNBC that Republicans are running scared because they fear the NRA more than they fear the voting public. If you are constantly shut down, if if your voice cannot be heard, then it s time to take extraordinary measures,  Bass said of the sit-in.  I think the NRA s influence is very profound. A lot of times, people think of it as an individual campaign contribution, that s not the issue. The issue is the fact that for a lot of members, if they do not have an  A  from the NRA, they re concerned about the NRA running campaigns against them, supporting their opponents or running independent expenditure campaigns against them. That s the fear. Indeed, Republicans in the Senate fear the NRA so much that they literally rejected a measure that would have banned suspected terrorists from legally buying guns. We re not talking about la -abiding citizens who are not being investigated for having ties to terrorist groups. We re talking about people who may have been radicalized and are being looked at by law enforcement. Orlando shooter Omar Mateen was a suspected ISIS sympathizer, but he was able to buy his assault rifle legally because the FBI was powerless to ban him from doing so because Republicans are apparently just fine with terrorists buying guns in America to kill Americans with.That s outrageous and should rally every voter in the country to throw Republicans out of office. Because the GOP and their NRA puppet masters are now just as much a threat to national security as the terrorists.Featured image via screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Nicolle Wallace, who was the White House Communications Director under President George. W. Bush had harsh words for Trump s rebranding attempts. In short, it s not working.

And you think that that can be held up against as a test of the discipline of the new Manafort era?WALLACE: I just think that is the test, right? So we will say that he read from his teleprompter and our colleague, Rachel, laughed at me last time I gave him credit for doing so. But I really   I think the test is to look at 24 whole hours. I will pledge, in service of this network, to watch the next 24 hours and report back, because what happened the last time, when he came out and gave a foreign policy speech that was riddled with its own problems, was that he stepped on his own message by trotting out conspiracy theories on Fox & Friends in the morning. So, this was a speech that had the definite imprint of Paul Manafort and the family, which has taken firm control of the Trump campaign. Trump, I m told, realized by Sunday night that things weren t just bad, they were, quote, awful. And so, he is trying to make a pivot. And when you have such a small, skeletal campaign, you can pivot in two days because there s not very many people to turn around. So he has made that pivot in the last hour. But we do have to watch the next 24 hours, the next, you know, however many interviews he does and see if he veers wildly off message like he s done in the past. The thing is, much of what Trump said during his anti-Hillary speech on Wednesday is nothing more than lies from anti-Clinton books, such as the widely debunked Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer, and Crisis of Character by Gary Byrne. Mr. Trump, you re going to have to do better than that, considering that all Hillary Clinton has to do is use your own literal words to show just how dangerous for America you are.Hell, even many members of your own party, veteran political operatives like Nicolle Wallace, can t stand you.

We all have jobs to do,  Colbert said.  I m doing my job right now and I ve got these cameras here to prove it. After the attacks in Orlando, I thought, maybe the government might do their job and pass any kind of law. Even a fig leaf to justify their existence. They couldn t even agree to keep people on the terror watch list from buying high-powered assault rifles. I don t understand you, Senate. Ninety-two percent of Americans want you to expand background checks for gun buyers and you just ignore them! Since when does 8 percent of the population get to have total control over an issue? That s like taking your entire family on a cross-country car trip and letting grandma choose all the music! Colbert then took the gloves off and continued smacking down Senate Republicans with a series of devastating jokes that should make every American so embarrassed that Republicans control Congress that they will do something to reverse that in November. Hey, Senate, my dog accomplished more than you this week when it rolled over and licked its nuts,  Colbert said, with a beat-track playing behind him. Hey, Senate, I ve seen bugs trapped in amber move faster than you! You guys think the terrorist watch list is when you put  Homeland  on your Netflix que. You might as well ask the gun lobby to check for a hernia as long as they ve got your balls in their hands. Senate, you couldn t pass a bill if it was coated in Ex-Lax. But if you ever did pass a bill it would say,  Be it resolved, no kissing and the NRA should just leave the money on the dresser.

Here s the video via YouTube:Senate Republicans should be ashamed of themselves. They were sent to Washington to protect and work for the American people, not the NRA. Clearly, they are incapable of doing anything substantial to protect the lives of Americans because the NRA owns them and would rather they insist that merely saying the words  radical Islamic terrorism  is enough. Republicans are not fit to be public servants. 150 years after the GOP ended slavery they ve become nothing more than slaves themselves on a plantation run by the National Rifle Association.

While Republicans munched on their lunch, Democratic politicians never left the floor.The act of civil disobedience was fittingly led by Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights movement icon.

Of course, raising money is normal for political campaigns, but there s a problem regarding the Trump campaign   most of the money he raised went right into his own pockets, or those of his family members. Further, more than 10%   meaning more than $6 million of the roughly $63 million in expenditures for Trump s campaign   has gone to the real estate mogul s own properties. But wait   it gets better.

She said: These are not the kinds of expenditures you would expect from someone who s actually running a campaign for President who actually intends to win the presidency.

It s more like a promotional tour for a celebrity who s hocking something than it is like a campaign where you need people to go out and vote for you in November.I mean, the biggest expenses are private jets, renting out venues   preferably ones where Mr. Trump gets to pay rent to himself for using that venue   and also swag. Merchandise is what the Trump campaign is spending its money on. Speaking of merchandise, the campaign gets its hats from a woman who sits on the board at Nazi sympathizer Eric Trump s charitable foundation. The polite way to say this is it s a racket. It s not designed to necessarily win the election.  While Trump might win, Maddow points out that it s pretty clear  it s not the aim. It is a byproduct of what is the principal effort, which is to make money. So, in other words, Trump is using a United States presidential election to make money. He doesn t want to be president. He wants to line his own pockets. Let s just hope that he doesn t manage to actually win an office he clearly doesn t even want. Trump wants power and money.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Warren Buffet, one of the richest men in the world and someone who actually does know a lot about money, has known this whole time what drove Trump s campaign finances into the ground. He didn t say as much, because at the time Buffett revealed this, it was 1991 and he was talking about Trump s bankrupt Taj Mahal. What he said then can apply now, though, and the state of Trump s campaign finances backs it up.Back when Trump filed for bankruptcy on the Taj Mahal, Buffett was giving speeches to undergrad students at Notre Dame when someone asked him where Trump went wrong. Buffett said: He simply got infatuated with how much money he could borrow, and he did not give enough thought to how much money he could pay back. That s so Trump, especially when faced with the possibility that he can t do what he wants because of consequences. So is this: The big problem with Donald Trump was he never went right. He basically overpaid for properties, but he got people to lend him the money. He was terrific at borrowing money. If you look at his assets, and what he paid for them, and what he borrowed to get them, there was never any real equity there. No, he never did go right. Trump has six bankruptcies total in his history, which is a lot, even over 25 years. He owes at least $100 million to Deutsche Bank. One has to wonder whether he got over his infatuation with borrowing, or whether he learned anything from his bankruptcies. He certainly hasn t learned to think about the consequences of anything he does.His campaign is more than $40 million in the hole with just over $1 million in the bank, and he just sent out his first desperate email begging his constituents for money. He ll need those donations to keep his campaign running, not pay off debt. Perhaps he thinks the debt will walk quietly away?This is significant because, if he s as in love with debt as he is with himself, he very well could make our national debt skyrocket despite his more than impossible promise to have it paid off within eight years. He s far more likely to actually bankrupt the U.S. than any other candidate if he s mired in this notion that he can borrow money indiscriminately.Buffett and Trump are polar opposites in the way they do business, and even in the way they see government. For instance, Trump has bragged about the low tax rate he pays, as if that s something to be proud of when the government is talking about cutting needed services because there isn t enough money. Buffett, on the other hand, has called for higher taxes on the wealthy repeatedly.That makes Buffett the smart one of these two, but then, we already knew that.Trump keeps saying he can change his tune anytime he wants, but the few paltry efforts he s made have failed spectacularly within just a few days. It s a good bet that he ll remain addicted to borrowing money, even as president. He has his eye on the prize, and the prize is a destroyed U.S., and a fat wallet for himself.Featured image by Paul Morigi/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Unfortunately for him, his god is a spiteful one who doesn t like people putting words in his mouth   or Jiminez is simply an intolerant person whom a civilized society will not tolerate. In any case, the good pastor just got some very, very bad news.After the shooting, Jimenez made some remarks that were horrifying even by right-wing  Christian  standards, explaining that the country shouldn t be mourning the death of 50 sodomites. People say, like:  Well, aren t you sad that 50 sodomites died?    Jimenez continued in his ravings.  Here s the problem with that. It s like the equivalent of asking me  what if you asked me:  Hey, are you sad that 50 pedophiles were killed today? Um, no, I think that s great. I think that helps society. You know, I think Orlando, Fla., is a little safer tonight,  he concluded, adding that he s upset more didn t die: The tragedy is that more of them didn t die.

We have many places of worship and other religious organizations in the properties we manage,  company officials said in a press release.  Like all our tenants, their occupancy rights are protected in their leases. But, of course, that won t be an issue once the lease is up in March of 2017, and Jimenez and his hateful friends are told to put their boots to the pavement. If Jimenez leaves early, his lease will be canceled without any penalty. Just as we respect the right of individuals to speak their views, as distasteful as they may be, we also respect the right of others to protest as a reflection of their values,  the company says. For decades, the owners and staff at Harsch Investment Properties have supported the LGBT community and many other organizations whose missions are to further respect, dignity and the ability for all individuals to live their lives as they wish. Jimenez is an ideological clone of Tempe Arizona s Pastor Stephen Anderson, who also made some rather horrific remarks about the massacre.

It was a lie.Obama s reverence for the troops stands in strong contrast to the recent episode with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.While feuding with Fox News during the Republican primaries, Trump threw a temper tantrum about debate moderator Megyn Kelly and skipped a debate on Fox News. Instead, Trump threw what he claimed was a fundraiser for military charities and announced at the event that he had raised several million dollars for those groups.Trump proceeded to congratulate himself at several campaign events in the following days.But the Washington Post looked into it, and could find no evidence that Trump had made the donations, despite using them to promote himself.Trump was eventually pressured into donating to the groups, months after he claimed he had done so in the first place, and held a defensive, petty press conference claiming that nothing had gone wrong, despite the ample evidence to the contrary.While President Obama, who is tasked with the decision of whether to put the military in harm s way, quietly honors military service and sacrifice, Trump used them as human shields and as a cheap and tawdry campaign gimmick.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He argued in favor of the death penalty for The Central Park Five, a group of black men accused of rape who were eventually all proven innocent after serving time in prison for most of their lives. Even when the men were found innocent, Trump took out ads calling for them to be executed.Trump was also accused by the federal government of engaging in discriminatory housing practices when operating his apartment buildings.The candidate also has an odd verbal tick in which he often refers to  the blacks,  rather than  blacks,   black people,  or  African-Americans.

To put it bluntly, Senate Republicans have a bad habit of saying they re voting for law abiding gun owners, and for gun owners  rights, when they vote down gun legislation. They aren t. They re voting against children   even extremely young children. Innocent children. American children. Their children and grandchildren. Politicians   take a look. This is your child, your children, your grandchildren, your great grand children and future generations to come. They will live their lives and grow up in this world based on your decisions. They are barely 3 and they will hide in bathroom stalls standing on top of toilet seats. I do not know what will be harder for them? Trying to remain quiet for an extended amount of time or trying to keep their balance without letting a foot slip below the stall door? Stacey Wehrman Feeley took a picture of her three-year old daughter standing on top of their toilet, and she originally thought this was simply the hijinks of a young child and she wanted to show her husband. Then her daughter told her what she was really doing: She was practicing for lockdown drills at her school.An innocent three-year old is practicing for lockdown drills. Why should a three-year old even have to worry about gun violence at her school, or anywhere else?That prompted the long Facebook post that contains the above paragraph, but that s not all she said. Feeley also said: No one thinks gun control will be 100% crime control. But maybe, just maybe, it helps 1% or 2% or 50%? Who knows unless we try? Why on earth are there not universal background checks? Where is a universal registration database? Why are high capacity magazines ever permitted to be sold to anyone other than direct to the military? Is that really necessary to protect yourself or hunt for that matter? What about smart guns, where are they? That is the question, isn t it? Republicans tend to parrot the NRA s line that these measures won t stop criminals or terrorists, so we shouldn t enact them at all. Democrats, too, do that to some degree, but not the way Republicans do. CNN called yesterday s votes  tough election year politics,  and mentioned longstanding disputes over what would be effective. Sadly, they re correct when they say this was expected.There s a reason the GOP is called  the Party of No.  They d rather do nothing at all than piss off their handlers, all while manipulating and controlling language to sound like they re the good guys.What Feeley is saying isn t,  I have the solution.  It s  We need to start somewhere, and all these ideas have been on and off the table for years. Why has nothing been done?  And that s the question that all our politicians need to start answering. It s also a question that the NRA needs to start answering, since they re among the loudest  more guns  voices out there.The face that politicians particularly members of the Party of No need to see isn t just the face of the victims in Orlando, or the victims of shootings that already happened. It s the children who have to live in a world where they aren t safe anywhere, even at home, because Congress patently refuses to even try.Read her full post below:Featured image via embedded Facebook post""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Everyone seems to hate him, so he ll need all the help he can get.So that help includes another loser   Michele Bachmann. The former Congresswoman and failed 2012 presidential candidate has been appointed, along with two dozen others, to a special evangelical advisory board.In announcing the formation of the board, Trump, who of course issued a gushing, pandering statement:I have such tremendous respect and admiration for this group and I look forward to continuing to talk about the issues important to Evangelicals, and all Americans, and the common sense solutions I will implement when I am President.Bachmann, who based her entire political life off a warped interpretation of God and the Bible, joins Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed, James Dobson, and a slew of mega church leaders all across the country.Bachmann, who ran as a Tea Party friend of the religious right in 2012, lost the contest in Iowa, a state with a heavy evangelical voting population. She placed a dismal sixth, while Mike Huckabee won. Bachmann is so hated by the evangelicals that even Phyllis Schlafly, a hero to the movement, wouldn t even consider Bachmann as her replacement for the ultra-conservative Eagle Forum.Having Bachmann on your advisory council for a demographic that hates her seems pretty counterintuitive, but hey, it s the Trump campaign   nothing makes sense.The board, which will meet regularly, will be prepping Trump for upcoming meetings with religious leaders all across the nation. A few of the individuals, including James Dobson and Richard Land, who are both leaders of churches and religious talk shows, actively campaigned for Ted Cruz and denounced Trump.As stated before, when all is said and done, the evangelicals will come home to the Republicans. So instead of reaching out to women, Hispanic and Latinos and millenials, Trump is actively spending his time appealing to people who will vote for him no matter what.It looks like the crazy Trump train has added the crazier Michele Bachmann to the mix.

Married or not, Trump didn t care. He s proud of the fact that he s a serial philanderer. Now, though, he s being sued for something that goes way beyond just cheating on one of his wives   he s accused of raping a 13-year-old.The alleged incidents (plural, as in a lot) happened more than 20 years ago. Trump was, at the time, a regular at convicted pedophile and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein s notorious Upper East Side parties.The plaintiff for now is going by the name  Jane Doe.  She alleges that the rapes occurred in 1994 and another woman corroborates her story.The lawsuit claims that a woman, who is only identified as  Tiffany Doe,  lured young girls from the Port Authority Bus Terminal and to the parties by promising them modeling careers. We do know how Trump loves models.The lawsuit, which repeats some allegations made in a dismissed complaint filed in California in April, offers a graphic account of the young girl s alleged encounters with Trump, the worst of which is described as a  savage sexual act.  The lawsuit claims that during this instance, Trump tied her to the bed and struck her face with his hand, saying he could do what he wanted, despite her pleas for him to stop. The complaint alleges that Epstein also raped her.Source: The Real DealTrump s legal counsel hasn t read the lawsuit, but you can be sure that Trump will deny the claim.There will never be criminal charges in this case because the statute of limitations has long past. This civil complaint might not make it to court either, because the statute of limitations for civil actions against rape is just five years, which means that the teenager would have had to sue while she was still a child. She claims, though, that there were extenuating circumstances   namely that she was terrified of Trump and that  her family would be physically harmed if not killed. Both defendants let plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats,  the complaint claims.The allegations are pretty brutal, especially given that the plaintiff was still a little girl:Monday s complaint details extremely violent and horrific alleged encounters between Trump and Doe. In what Doe s attorneys describe as a  savage sexual attack,  Trump allegedly tied her to a bed and exposed himself before raping her. When she pleaded that he stop, Trump allegedly  responded  by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted,  according to the suit.Source: The GothamistThe plaintiff filed a similar suit in California in April. That suit was dismissed because of a paperwork technicality. Trump denied any wrongdoing in that suit. He claimed they were politically motivated. Of course, he claims everything is politically motivated. He can t deny, though, that he had a friendship with Epstein, who was convicted of sex slavery.The plaintiff is asking for just $75,000 and legal fees. She won t be getting rich, even if she wins.Featured image via Stephen Lovekin with Getty Images.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Omar Mateen walked into Pulse Nightclub in Orlando and opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle, murdering 49 people and injuring 53 others. In the week since the attack, Republicans have proven just how little they care about the people they are supposed to serve and there is no greater example of this than Greg Evers   a GOP candidate for Congress.Evers is a candidate for a congressional district that is located just a couple hours away from Orlando and he has decided that the best way to honor the people lost at Pulse is to give away a gun that is similar to the one they were murdered with. The candidate announced the Independence Day raffle on Facebook, saying: With terrorism incidents on the rise, both at home and abroad, protecting our constitutional rights has never been more important. With all that s happening in the world today, I ve never felt stronger about the importance of the second amendment in protecting our homeland than I do now. The Washington Post reports:The custom-built AR-15 rifle, which the Evers campaign says is the  Homeland Defender  collector s edition, will be given away to one randomly chosen person who has liked and shared Evers  page or signed up on his campaign website. It is open only to adults in the district. The winner will be selected on July 4 and must pass all required background and security checks.The rifle was made in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, and displays the Second Amendment on a metal plate on the right side near the trigger guard.On Evers  Facebook page (which has a whopping 2,952 fans), Evers whined that his gun giveaway post had been removed  after a California-based liberal activist reported the post for  promoting graphic violence.'  It s interesting that he is trying to convince Florida voters that a scary liberal from California is out to get him, especially given the fact that Facebook does not tell users who reported their posts.https://www.facebook.com/882110315244181/photos/a.896229197165626.1073741828.882110315244181/918169401638272/?type=3&theaterSo, not only is Evers an NRA puppet, he is a lying NRA puppet.As a Florida resident and the best friend of someone who lost someone in the shooting at Pulse, I can not adequately describe how sick it makes me to see Republicans using the massacre to push their MOAR GUNZ! agenda.

In fact, most Americans   nearly 80 percent   agree that Citizens United needs to go. You d think that would be all Congress needs to propel them to do the right thing, but unfortunately, thanks to the very Supreme Court decision everyone hates, Congress won t do anything about it. There s too much money involved. The states, though   that s another matter. Five have already voted to reverse the decision and you can bet that more are coming soon.This year, over a billion dollars will be spent electing just the president. Millions will be spent on down ticket candidates. Much of this money is coming from PACs and Super PACs, with donations from corporations and billionaires. The money goes right into the coffers of candidates, who in turn give the money to media outlets who inundate us with ads. Everyone wins except the American people. Neither the media nor the politicians complain, mostly because they don t want to bite the hands that feed them. So, it s up to grass roots movements, and the grass roots will win out.The cliche is that the way to fight fire is with fire. That s what an organization called WolfPac is doing. They have opened a pac that is designed to get rid of Pacs and Super PACs. Here s what they want to do:To restore true, representative democracy in the United States by pressuring our State Legislators to pass a much needed Free and Fair Elections Amendment to our Constitution. There are only 2 ways to amend our Constitution: (1) Go through Congress (single digit approval rating) or (2) Go through our State Legislators via an amendment proposing convention.Wolf PAC believes that we can no longer count on our Federal Government to do what is in the best interest of the American people due to the unfettered amount of money they receive from outside organizations to fund their campaigns. We point to the failure of the Disclose Act as rock solid evidence that this would be a total waste of our time, effort, and money. We also point to the recent decision by the US Supreme Court to not even hear a case filed by Montana claiming it did not have to abide by Citizens United, as proof that state legislation is not a sufficient measure to solve this problem. We believe that we have no choice but to put an amendment in the hands of our State Legislators, who are not, at this moment in time, completely blinded by the influence of money, and might actually do what 96% of the country wants   take away the massive influence that money has over our political process.The list of states that have jumped on board is hardly surprising. It started with Vermont, the one state brave enough to elect a Democratic Socialist as a senator. In 2012, Vermont passed a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment saying that only people are people and that corporations are just made up entities. Then came California, the largest state in the country. Then came New Jersey and Illinois.The latest to join the call for a constitutional amendment if Rhode Island. In a unanimous vote, the state of Rhode Island became the fifth to take matters into their own hands.Here s the video:And more from The Young Turks:Sure, this is a drop in the bucket. A constitutional amendment needs to be ratified by 38 states and there aren t 38 blue states in the country, but that might not matter. People are sick of our elections being purchased by the highest bidder. People are sick of billionaires having a much larger voice in our democracy than anyone else. People are sick of the constant barrage of political advertising. The only people to lose out of turning corporations back into non-people are corporations and the politicians whose pockets are being lined.Featured image via Alex Wong with Getty Images.

It s so unique that he s self-funded it into being broke. His FEC filings, through May 31 of this year, reveal an awful lot more than that, though. The campaign has paid millions to his own businesses and property, including his ridiculously luxurious plane, and Mar-a-Lago, his personal estate in Florida.Derek Willis, a journalist at ProPublica, tweeted out a spreadsheet that ProPublica put together of all campaign disbursements to things with  Trump  in the name. In total, the campaign has paid nearly $1.4 million to Trump s own businesses since he launched it last year:Recipients of payments from Trump campaign with  Trump  in name, through May 31. Doesn t include Mar-a-Lago/planes. pic.twitter.com/JF6skaWYGF  Derek Willis (@derekwillis) June 21, 2016At first, that doesn t sound like a lot. Maybe Trump is actually reining himself in? That s less than five percent of his total campaign expenditures. But this is King Donald, and that s not nearly everything. The campaign has also spent $423,371 for the use of Mar-a-Lago, which is a personal residence, and roughly $5 million to Tag Air, Inc. the company that operates his private Boeing 757 with the solid gold seatbelt buckles for the use of his plane.That brings the total up to roughly $6.8 million that Trump s campaign has paid to him for one thing or another, and that s more than 10 percent of the $63 million that his campaign has spent since he formally entered the race last year.How does he get away with that? Is it even legal?Back in January, the Miami Herald ran a piece on these same expenditures. At that time, Trump had paid nearly one out of every three campaign dollars to something he owned. This is actually legal in fact, federal election law requires campaigns to pay fair market for goods and services rendered, even if they come from a candidate s own businesses but the sheer amount that Trump has managed to send to himself through loopholes in campaign finance law, is very unusual.In short, he knew that election law requires his campaign to pay for everything, otherwise it counts as an undocumented campaign contribution. So, he probably figured, why not use his own businesses as much as possible? Then he can funnel money to himself, and there s nothing anybody can do about it because it s perfectly legal.It s also more than a little suspicious, because, as the headline of the Miami Herald s story notes, Trump has  perfected the art of the campaign expense,  in such a way that he personally profits, even if he ultimately isn t elected.But wait! If it s not illegal, why is it suspicious? Quite simply, if you want to know how a presidential candidate is going to run the country, look at how they run their campaign. Trump won t just run the country like a business; he ll very likely find ways to use the Office of the President to line his own pockets while he holds that position.In the end, Trump only cares about Trump, and his campaign finance records prove it better than anything else he s done.Featured image by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Thanks to his weak competition in the Republican primary, Trump did not have to spend much to get an advantage over rival campaigns and Super PACs, but in the general election it is unlikely that Trump can get by simply based on tweets and bombast as he did with Bush, Cruz, and Rubio.On Monday night Trump filed his finance report with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the failure of his campaign to bring in money is nothing less than amazing.In May of 2016, Trump only raised $3.1 million from contributors and loaned his campaign an additional $2.2 million. At the end of the month the campaign only had a shocking $1.3 million dollars in cash on hand.As journalists quickly pointed out, Trump s fundraising more likely resembled a House member with  a semi-competitive seat  or  a safe Senate seat in a deep red state.  The numbers are definitely not the sort of figures associated with a national presidential campaign.The results look even worse compared to Hillary Clinton. At the end of May, her campaign had $42 million on hand, an amazing disparity of $40 million between the two campaigns.And while donors have said they are still unable to determine which Super PAC to donate to in order to support Trump, the Super PAC backing Clinton, Priorities USA, had its biggest month ever with $12 million in donations.Even compared to fellow Republicans, Trump s numbers are pathetic. In May of 2012, Mitt Romney s presidential campaign and the Republican Party raised $78 million dollars. The current GOP only raised $12 million this May.Defunct campaigns like Ben Carson s currently have $7.4 million on hand, more than Trump s active campaign.There are also some weird expenditures from the Trump campaign found in the FEC reports. He appears to be redirecting some money back towards himself.His campaign paid $423,371 for the use of Trump s own house the Mar-A-Lago mansion and club in Florida.Even stranger, Trump seems to be drawing a salary from his campaign, a very unusual arrangement especially for someone claiming to be a  billionaire.  The filings find that Trump is regularly being paid $2,574 as part of  payroll  for the campaign.Featured image via Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

However, there is a growing faction of the party that is not at all happy about this. Trump has been a public relations nightmare since the day he started running, and he is showing no signs of stopping that trend. Further, anyone with a brain can see that he is dangerously unqualified to hold the office of the presidency. However, that has not stopped major GOP players from lining up behind Trump like the spineless, party-before-country morons that they are. The #NeverTrump faction of the party sees this as the massive problem that it is, though, and they have decided to openly revolt in an effort to deny Trump the nomination at the GOP convention in Cleveland.This newly formed group of #NeverTrump delegates has rebranded themselves. They are now known as  Free the Delegates. The name comes from the idea that delegates bound to Donald Trump should be free to vote their conscience at the convention rather than being forced to vote for the presumptive nominee. They held a conference call Sunday night, with a reported more than 1,000 Republican delegates nationwide participating in the brainstorming efforts to stop Trump from formally taking their party s nomination.However, there is a problem. The party elite at the state and national level are not going to easily allow these country-before-party Republicans to rise up against Trump. Delegates from the #NeverTrump faction say that they are facing  intimidation  from party leaders who are insisting that they are all, as a party, obligated to support Trump. A delegate from North Carolina says that she and other N.C. delegates are very much under direct threat from our state with a $10,000 fine  if they refuse to vote for Trump. She also alleges that she was  threatened  via social media over her #NeverTrump position. The same delegate says that in Arizona, in order to participate in the convention, delegates actually have to sign a pledge that they will, unequivocally, vote pro-Trump.Despite the intimidation and threats, though, those on the nationwide Sunday night call say that they want those who are uneasy about Trump to  do the right thing, not the easy thing.  #NeverTrump Colorado delegate Regina Thompson said to those who support their cause: We want you to be proud to tell your children and grandchildren that the person we have nominated and are ready to elect as president is a moral person who will take seriously the oath of office. Will you be able to tell them that you were not afraid of public opinion or party leaders? Luckily, the #NeverTrump delegates already have an outside PAC, called Courageous Conservatives, that is going to be collecting funds to help with legal fees due to the inevitable blowback those looking to oust Trump will face. Spokesman Steve Lonegan says to the delegates that it will help to provide you support should you be threatened on the state level with some form of retribution. Kendal Unrah of Colorado is on the RNC Rules Committee and firmly #NeverTrump. She says of the planned ousting: It s just kind of an easy sell. And I don t think that there s going to be enough organized resistance on the other side to defeat it. Unruh does acknowledge how difficult it will be to get rid of Trump, but she is also optimistic: I m just very glad that we ve just all come together so quickly, because we have a monumental task to actually accomplish. But I will tell you the momentum that I have seen within the last week   it is just astonishing how fast this has come together,  she said. We re going to be hitting our peak right at convention time. Good luck, #NeverTrump delegates. You re the only remotely moral GOPers left in your party.Either way, this GOP civil war should be massively fun to watch for Democrats.Here is a video detailing the newly revived #NeverTrump effort, via NBC News:Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Actually, this happens after every major mass shooting, and like with every major mass shooting, the NRA won.Four bills have gone down in a predictable and fiery death.The first bill was proposed by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Democrats voted against it because it didn t go far enough and because it could actually put more guns into the wrong people s hands.Democrats opposed the legislation because it does not expand the types of gun sales that require background checks, and they said some provisions could make it easier for mentally ill individuals to buy guns.Source: USA TodayOnly 53 Senators voted for the bill, and while that may have been enough in another time, today, nothing passes the Senate without a filibuster proof majority of 60 votes.The second bill to go down was proposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California). It would have allowed the Justice Department to stop people who are on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns. This one is also backed by President Obama.Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., called the Republican measures  political stunts  and said they are  meaningless in doing something to stop gun violence. These are amendments to divert attention from real legislation,  Reid said.  Why? So Republicans (can) say  Hey, look, we tried,  and all the time their cheerleaders, their bosses at the NRA, are cheering. The third bill, which also went down in a blaze of glory, is an amendment by Senator Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut), who wants to close the  gun show loophole  and require everyone who wants to buy a gun to go through a background check.The fourth bill was written by Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) and would give a three day waiting period for people who have been investigated for terrorism within the last five years. Of course, with no funding for background checks, nothing could go wrong, right?This is a dance the Senate that happens after every mass shooting, and the result is always the same gridlock. All the bills were defeated along party lines. This, despite the fact that the majority of their constituents want stricter gun control.Featured image via Getty Images.

Mohammed A.

They know what s going on. They know that [Omar Mateen] was bad,  he said after the Orlando massacre.  They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad.

First, Muslims like me can t see into the hearts of other worshipers. (Do you know the hidden depths of everyone in your community?) Second, Trump is wrong that we don t speak up when we re able.Malik goes on to explain that after learning that Mateen had been watching videos put out by terrorist propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki,  I contacted the FBI again to let them know that Omar had been watching Awlaki s tapes. He hadn t committed any acts of violence and wasn t planning any, as far as I knew. And I thought he probably wouldn t, because he didn t fit the profile: He already had a second wife and a son. But it was something agents should keep their eyes on. Why did he do this?I had told the FBI about Omar because my community, and Muslims generally, have nothing to hide. I love this country, like most Muslims that I know. I don t agree with every government policy (I think there s too much money in politics, for instance), but I m proud to be an American.He concludes with a direct message for the Republican nominee for President of the United States:  Trump s assertions about our community   that we have the ability to help our country but have simply declined to do so   are tragic, ugly and wrong.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""It seems that part of Donald Trump s plan to  make America great again  involves building the Keystone XL pipeline. The reason he thinks it will make us great again has nothing to do with the jobs it will, or won t, create, and has nothing to do with oil sales from Canada to the U.S., since Keystone XL will just deliver oil to the Gulf for export. Trump wants a direct piece of TransCanada s profits in return for allowing the pipeline to be built.That sounds great, doesn t it? We should be compensated for allowing TransCanada to transport oil across the entire width of the U.S., right? Plus, it d be an influx of cash. Trump even said: I want it built, but I want a piece of the profits  That s how we re going to make our country rich again. All right! Score one for the little guy!Or not. Under international law set forth by the World Trade Organization, governments must apply the same tax treatments to both domestic and foreign products. Trump s plan amounts to an extra tax on TransCanada that domestic drillers, particularly in North Dakota, would escape despite also using the pipeline. There are also problems with his plan usurping Congressional authority on taxes, which is why Congressional Republicans aren t happy about this.However, Trump sees the issue through the lens of his shady business acumen, and not through the realities of international relations and laws, so of course he thinks he can simply make a deal with TransCanada and with Canada itself. Plus, he knows TransCanada is willing to do almost anything to get that pipeline built, so he believes he d have them over a barrel (no pun intended) and could extract whatever concessions he wants from them, international law be damned.There s also the issue of hurting relations with Canada. He s already hurt our relationship with Mexico and would continue to do so as president   does he really think alienating the only two countries with which we share land borders is a good idea? Jeffrey Jones, a columnist for Globe and Mail, called this  kooky proposal  uncomfortably close to nationalization. Jones also said: In fact, why stop at oil pipelines? Mr. Trump could demand a fatter take from natural gas lines or even restaurants and retail stores. And Trump would, because that s how he s going to  make America great again.  In his mind, the world owes us a ton, and while many might agree, many of those same people don t agree with the tactics he plans to use to make them pay up, including ripping up existing trade agreements like NAFTA.This isn t the first time that Trump has said we  need a better deal,  on Keystone XL, but, last year, he said that he would approve the pipeline project as is immediately upon taking office. That s since changed, and as long as the U.S. gets the better deal, he doesn t really care about the law. It s a similar situation with what he wants to do with China   against international law, but a better deal for us and so he ll find a way to force it.President Obama has repeatedly blocked the construction of Keystone XL because we don t need another environmental disaster waiting to happen running the entire width of the country. In fact, Obama met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about it, and while Trudeau was disappointed that Obama would block Keystone, they both believe action on climate change will depend on both of them working together and making compromises.Trump, on the other hand, thinks climate change is a hoax for a whole host of illogical reasons, not the least of which is because it gets cold and snows in some places in the winter. His motive for wanting to build Keystone XL is purely profit-driven, like any good little corporate mogul s motives would be. At least Obama has solid reasons for opposing Keystone XL. Trump just wants money, money, and more money.The sad thing is that it s not likely that even his idea would  make our country rich again.  He s thinking about his own profit. Who knows where that money would go should King Trump actually get elected? Given his disregard for all sorts of laws, he d probably find a way to divert that money to his own coffers, at least until he was caught and hauled before an international court over the issue.Good ol  Trump.

The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future. This move comes amid the fact that Trump s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has pumped more than $20 million into advertising in key general election battleground states, while Trump has not started advertising at all.

This was how British MP Jo Cox died at the hands of Tommy Mair (or  Death to Traitors,  as he prefers to be known in court).This was a horrific crime committed by the sort of person who would support Donald Trump in the United States (a white supremacist), and the murderer s fascination with everything the far Right has to offer hits very close to home for many of us after Robert Lewis Dear s horrific attack on a Planned Parenthood facility last year. Naturally, as Britain is our ally and as Ms. Cox worked on the Barack Obama s campaign in 2008 before she became MP for Batley and Spen, the President called her husband to offer his condolences. President Obama offered his sincere condolences on behalf of the American people to Mr. Cox and his two young children, as well as to her friends, colleagues and constituents,  the White House said in a statement. The President noted that the world is a better place because of her selfless service to others, and that there can be no justification for this heinous crime, which robbed a family, a community, and a nation of a dedicated wife, mother, and public servant.

Others began demanding that Obama call the families of quite literally anyone else who has ever died, ever   police officers, the families of various far-Right icons, Snoopy, who knows? Mothers debated whether he is simply  black trash  or  half black trash.  All in all, it s a complete mess in there:       Obama did not have to make that phone call   but that s the sort of person he is. While he cannot reasonably be expected to call the families of every single person who dies, he is the kind of guy who will absolutely take time out of his overloaded schedule to offer comfort to the family of one of our allies  legislators after someone very Trump-like viciously murders her for no better reason than he s a racist   especially with  America First  being chanted at Trump rally after Trump rally.This horrific murder serves as a reminder that far-right extremists are not limited simply to the United States (though they seem to be more vocal and unashamed of their racist opinions here than in other places).

According to the girl, she was standing next to a rope swing when the same group of white boys grabbed the rope, wrapped it around her neck and then threw her violently to the ground.Images of the girl s neck show rope burns that are consistent with her story.This time school officials claim that KP s injuries were the result of an  accident,  not intentional racist bullying.If that s not enough, they are now insinuating that the 12-year-old and her family are trying to milk the school for money.After school officials refused to address the behavior of the student bullies, KP s parents contacted an attorney.

On both occasions he was released without treatment.According to police, authorities were not able to hold him in custody because he had not broken any laws.The latter half of the body cam video shows officer Vince Fraker speaking with Duran before his arrest.

In spite of the brutal treatment he received from police, he was never charged with any crime.According to the Denver Post:A grand jury in April found there were no fileable charges against Fraker or another officer involved in the encounter.The grand jurors wrote in a report that while Fraker was responsible for Duran s injuries   a fractured neck that left him paralyzed from his nipples down   when he rolled him out of a La Junta police SUV, it  cannot be the basis of any criminal charges. Duran s attorneys have filed a federal lawsuit, stating: La Junta Police Department training of officers does not include proper training in responding to calls involving persons in crisis or with obvious mental health problems, including use of force policies and de-escalation strategies. The suit goes on to say: Fraker s use of excessive force as described above herein was outrageous and shocking to the conscience, in violation of Duran s substantive due process rights.

These 50 Sodomites were all perverts and pedophiles and they are the scum of the earth and the earth is a little bit better place now, and I ll even take it a little further I heard on the news today that there are still several dozen of these q****s in ICU and I will pray that God will finish the job that that man started, that he will end their lives and by tomorrow morning they will all be burning in hell so that they don t get any more opportunities to go out and hurt little children. Here s the video of the full sermon via YouTube if you can stomach it. The remarks above are at the beginning of the video.Romero was also echoing Arizona pastor Steven Anderson, who also had no sympathy or compassion for his fellow human beings and also called for all gays people to be executed.In an interview with Fox 4 about his hateful remarks, Romero showed no regret whatsoever. The Bible teaches they are predators, and I believe that every Sodomite is a pedophile and is a predator,  Romero said.But Fox 4 also consulted a Bible scholar, who made it clear that Romero knows nothing about the book or Christianity. No Christian who has any formal understanding of the interaction between the Old and the New Testament would say such a thing,  said theologian Steve Kellmeyer,  He s just one more in a long list of people who don t get what it means to be Christian. It s disgusting how so-called  men of God  have been reacting to this tragedy all week long since it happened. The way they are cheering this loss of life makes them no better than ISIS, whose leaders we all know must be praising this attack just as fervently. These people who dare to call themselves  Christians  have thrown in with the terrorists against American citizens and that should not go unpunished. Each of these  churches should lose their tax exemptions and be shut down for inciting hate crimes against the LGBT community.And if conservatives are still wondering why more people are rejecting religion today, they should look no further than these fundamentalist pastors they have allowed to lace Christianity with hate and violence.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Sadly, however, Bradshaw s Master Degree, with a focus on childhood behavioral disorders, could not have prepared her for the reality of today s classrooms.After being forced to make her students cry every day in class, Bradshaw resigned from Polk County schools last October.Her resignation letter goes straight to the heart of the problem with America s schools.She writes:The children don t only cry. Some misbehave so that they will be the  bad kid  not the  stupid kid , or because their little bodies just can t sit quietly anymore, or because they don t know the social rules of school and there is no time to teach them.The teacher s background in childhood behavior disorders helped her understand that these weren t  problem children . They were just normal children trapped inside a problematic system. While they may not have arrived at school with behavioral disorders, they were likely to leave with them.Bradshaw s letter goes on to explain:I can say with confidence that it is not the children who are disordered. The disorder is in the system which requires them to attempt curriculum and demonstrate behaviors far beyond what is appropriate for their age.This is what happens when lawmakers, not teachers and parents, get together to decide what s best for children whom they will never spend a single day with.It s also what happens when the power to educate is taken out of the hands of educators.Bradshaw writes:The disorder is in the system which bars teachers from differentiating instruction meaningfully, which threatens disciplinary action if they decide their students need a five minute break from a difficult concept, or to extend a lesson which is exceptionally engaging.She adds that:The disorder is in a system which has decided that students and teachers must be regimented to the minute and punished if they deviate. The disorder is in the system which values the scores on wildly inappropriate assessments more than teaching students in a meaningful and research based manner.All across the US, teachers and students are being subjected to this kind of strict regimine, which many, like Bradshaw, believe is doing more harm than good.Rather than improving student performance, student test scores are declining.As the Washington Post reported here in November:Fourth-graders and eighth-graders across the United States lost ground on national mathematics tests this year, the first declines in scores since the federal government began administering the exams in 1990.Reading performance also was sobering: Eighth-grade scores dropped, according to results released Wednesday, while fourth-grade performance was stagnant compared with 2013, the last time students took the test.Testing of students in 2013 also showed a decline from previous years.While some might be willing to support high-stakes testing if there were evidence that teaching to the tests was improving student performance, the opposite is true.Under No Child Left Behind, which ties teacher pay and school funding to student test results, kids and teachers are subjected to an enormous amount of pressure. The consequences of this failed experiment stretch beyond the academic, as Bradshaw s letter illustrates.All across the country, educators report  rising numbers of children struggling to manage their emotions in an academic environment.  The problems are most pronounced among the youngest students, teachers say.As Oregon Live reports here, in recent years  more students are coming to school unprepared or unsettled, which can lead to tantrums, running from the classroom, despondent behavior or physical aggression. As Bradshaw points out in her resignation letter, it is not the children who are disordered. It s the system.Photo by Bill O Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The email went on to say that Santora would suffer  consequences  for supporting legislation designed to provide victims of child sexual abuse with the justice they deserve.The bill which provoked the vicious message from Caput would extend the amount of time that child sexual assault victims have to bring claims against their abusers.Under the state s current law a victim of sexual assault only has until his or her 30th birthday to file a claim against the abuser. The legislation, which passed the state s lower house in April, would extend the deadline until the victim s 50th birthday.According to The Intellectualist, Caput is heading up a lobbying effort against the bill.The email provoked the wrath of state lawmakers on both sides of political aisle.Republican state legislator Mike Vereb, who is also a Catholic, accused the archbishop of using  mafia-like tactics  against lawmakers, saying: This mob boss approach of having legislators called out, he really went right up to the line. He is going down a road that is frankly dangerous for the status of the church in terms of it being a non-profit. The Catholic church has no business engaging in any type of lobbying activity. In order to maintain its tax-exempt status, a church is strictly prohibited from engaging in political activity.The letter that Caput sent out is a prime example of the kind of religious bullying the Establishment Clause was put in place to prevent.Given the Catholic Church s history of child sexual abuse, Caput s email accusing Santora of  betraying the church  would indicate that the church is aware that many more victims exist.It seems clear that the church would prefer those victims never receive the justice they deserve.Image credit via Michal on Flickr""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

To that end, he hired Daniel Petrocelli, who has represented everyone from Enron s Jeffrey Skilling, to major companies like Warner Bros. and Disney. Petrocelli is also the lawyer who represented the Goldman family in their successful wrongful death suit against O.J. Simpson.So Trump has a skilled, powerful attorney, and in other news, fire is hot. However, Petrocelli is both a strange and notable pick for The Donald. Why? His political donation history shows that he s not anything like a Trump supporter, or even Republican. In fact, he s a registered Democrat, and he s already maxed out the amount he can personally donate to none other than Hillary Clinton.While Trump rails against the law firm representing the plaintiffs in this case he claims they ve given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hillary s campaign he s ignoring the fact that his own lead attorney has those kinds of ties to Hillary, too. If the plaintiffs  attorneys are out to get him because they re Hillary supporters, then it follows that he should worry that his own lead attorney can t be trusted to represent him skillfully and fairly for that very same reason.For instance, Petrocelli has been very quiet while Trump rails about everyone being biased against him, especially in this court case. He also directly contradicted Trump s racist whining that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump U. case, can t be fair to Trump because of his  Mexican heritage. The judge is doing his job,  said Daniel Petrocelli, shaking his head, when asked if planned to seek Curiel s recusal. We re not seeking to recuse the judge.' This doesn t worry King Donald? How many brain cells does he have rattling around in his head?Of course, Trump himself has come under fire from Republicans for his past support of Democrats. However, Petrocelli s support isn t exactly in the past. Records show that his most recent donations to Hillary were in January of this year.He also has a long history of giving financial support to other Democrats, too, such as Dianne Feinstein and even Al Gore. He might be able to separate his political leanings from his work, but this is a very high profile case involving a presidential candidate, and the fact that he s a major supporter of his client s opponent won t help Trump s falling poll numbers, or his terrible image among conservatives.This actually speaks more to Trump s intelligence and foresight   or lack thereof   than it does anything about Petrocelli himself. He s completely undermined his own  everyone is against me  argument, and proven that he s nothing but a dimwitted, walking contradiction who looks for sparkle and jazz. Yes, he hired Petrocelli for his skill in the courtroom, but he s so paranoid and distrustful that this makes no sense. Chances are, a lot of his other picks for a lot of other positions will make no sense either.Featured image by Dave Einsel/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Even Anderson Cooper, who is one of the nation s most respected journalists, and who happens to be gay, had his credibility called into question, at least when he s covering stories that happen to be about gay people.That was the accusation by Fox News  Howard Kurtz, who said that Cooper couldn t have been fair to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, when he asked her about her civil rights record when it comes to LGBT issues. I respect Anderson Cooper and I think he s generally fair,  Kurtz told Fox News contributor Guy Benson.  Do you think he was acting as more than just an aggressive journalist? He seemed like an activist,  Benson agreed.  Of course, I only watch Fox all the time. But I ve heard that he s very good at his job, he s a versatile journalist [but] in this circumstance, I thought the line of questioning for the attorney general of Florida, under the circumstance and given the context of what had just happened in that state, it was a bizarre non sequitur. It seemed like he was browbeating her for unrelated political thought crimes in her past,  Benson added,  which did not relate to the to the task at hand, which is roundly condemning the horrific atrocity that happened. Here s the video:This was the argument used by Donald Trump, when he said that a Latino   American judge just had to be biased against him, simply because the judge was Latino. Really, this is the argument used against anyone who isn t a penis carrying member of the white race. Women can t talk about birth control or abortion; we re too biased. People of color can t talk about issues facing them and gay people can t talk about the time a freak walked into a gay bar and murdered 50 people. Oh, and g-d forbid people, other than rich, white men, decide to speak for themselves.Fox News and Kurtz, of course, are the poster children for media bias. The entire network is built around it. Kurtz once defended Trump against his kicking Univision s Jorge Ramos out of a press conference, saying Ramos  seemed like a heckler.  Ramos, though, like Cooper, was just doing his job. If skin color or sexual orientation means that one must be biased, perhaps it s time to look at the biases of rich, straight white men.Kurtz was fine with Christians covering the attack on a Christian church in South Carolina, though.Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The reality is that LaPierre decided to go on a lengthy rant that made him sound as if he is some mad man preaching about the end of days.Dickerson began the interview by questioning La Pierre about the fact that the gunman responsible for the massacre was able to legally purchase an assault rifle despite having been previously investigated by the FBI.  LaPierre decided to divert the question by talking about how the narrative that has emerged around gun regulations is nothing more than an attempt to divert attention away from fighting terrorism.

Oh gosh, I don t think I can do it.  It s like what we re doing with this debate on the hill right now, it s like they are trying to stop a freight train with a piece of Kleenex. The entire interview boils down to a fear-based advertisement for guns. Right down to La Pierre s statement that terrorists are  on the verge of overwhelming us.  So far, no evidence has emerged to suggest that Omar Mateen, the gunman in the Orlando shooting, was seriously working with any international terrorist organization. Evidence has been piling up that speaks to the contrary. Including Mateen s apparent lack of understanding of basic middle eastern politics, his history of violent outbursts, and his intolerance of LGBT people.What La Pierre and the rest of the NRA will never admit to is that Mateen was a homegrown terrorist and that their organization is politically and culturally influential in producing such terrorists.

And from there, Warren proceeded to lampoon the idea of Brown as Trump s vice-presidential nominee. I hear that Donald Trump is floating Scott Brown as a possible running mate.

As a candidate, she has taken a lot of heat from progressives for being late to coming around to marriage equality. She was, but it s not that simple. If you scratch just a little beneath the surface, you ll find a true champion of LGBT rights throughout the world.When it comes to Clinton s evolution on LGBT rights, there are a lot of legitimate complaints. First, her husband s legacy, although also not that simple, is the failed military policy of Don t Ask, Don t Tell. Bill Clinton didn t love the policy, but it was what he saw as the best compromise at the time.Of course, that wasn t Hillary s policy. In fact, in 1999, she said she was against Don t Ask, Don t Tell, so let s move on. The criticism that has the most teeth is that Hillary didn t come around to accepting marriage equality until just three years ago, but that was only one step in a long history of support.One accomplishment that has received scant attention is that she ushered gay rights onto the international stage. It is fair to say that without Clinton s efforts, the global struggle for equality for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people would not have proceeded as fast as it has in the past several years, nor would the United States be seen today as a global leader in that struggle. At the heart of these efforts was the 2011 United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, otherwise known as the UNHRC Gay Rights Resolution, an international agreement whose drafting and signing Clinton oversaw. With that document, and a sister UNHRC resolution of 2014 condemning anti-LGBT violence and discrimination, the UN has formally recognized gay rights as part of the international human rights regime.Clinton s gay rights crusade began within the State Department, which she transformed into one of the most if not the most gay-friendly bureaucracies in Washington, both in terms of its policies and its administration. This signaled a radical makeover for the stodgy institution, which under Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, Clinton s predecessors in the George W. Bush administration, had seen little drive for gay equality. Largely beholden to the Christian right and social conservatives, the Bush administration was hostile toward LGBT people and issues. As president, Bush endorsed an amendment to the federal constitution banning same-sex marriage, and his political managers used same-sex marriage as a wedge issue during his reelection campaign in 2004 with the intention of mobilizing so-called values voters in swing states like Ohio.Source: Foreign AffairsHer support of LGBT rights didn t stop in international waters. She extended family leave and other government benefits to families of same-sex couples who worked in the State Department.She fought discrimination in the State Department, despite a 1950s executive order by Dwight Eisenhower to fire all gay people, because homosexuality was considered a risk. Clinton instead recognized the Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Association (GLIFAA) for its  courageous actions in the face of historic discrimination.  She also ended the firings.Clinton even had gay pride celebrations at embassies and consulates throughout the world. Every May 17th, to celebrate International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, embassies hang rainbow flags. She also made a concerted effort to be inclusive in her hiring, by, among other things, appointing six openly gay ambassadors to serve on several continents.Here she is with her own words:Don t take my word, or hers, for it.

And they should just admit that,  Carlson said.The call to once again ban assault weapons has been strong ever since the mass shooting in Orlando that killed 50 people and wounded another 53. ISIS sympathizer Omar Mateen was able to buy his assault weapon because Republicans in Congress refuse to ban suspected terrorists from purchasing and owning guns.Even Fox News hosts Bill O Reilly and Gretchen Carlson have declared their support for banning assault weapons during their own programs on the conservative network.Anna Kooiman explained that supporters of an assault weapons ban reason that a person will do less damage if they are only able to carry a knife or something much less deadly than an AR-15, which is a weapon of war and not something that was designed for civilian use.But Carlson claimed that crock pots should also be banned because terrorists used them to kill people, too. Well, a crock pot caused those killings at the Boston Marathon. I think we need to regulate those or ban them. There s no reason you should be able to buy a crock pot at Walmart ever again. And that s not only wrong, it s a false equivalency.As Raw Story points out, the Boston Marathon bombers used a pressure cooker, not a crock pot, as their weapon of choice.

My opinion, military and police are the only ones that should have them. Hagan has partnered with a local gun dealer to run his promotion, and customers have to go there to go through a background check and get the weapons. Apparently, that makes it all okay because it means he knows he can t give them out like they re candy.Besides that, he believes that the people who take advantage of this promotion will be fully responsible, because everyone knows that all the people who obtain their guns legally are very responsible gun owners   oh wait. Omar Mateen, and so many other mass shooters, bought their guns legally, not to mention all the idiots who have no clue what gun safety is, and end up accidentally shooting someone to death.Hagan claims he won t extend the offer to someone from whom he gets a bad feeling. So, what, he s telepathic and knows who has bad intentions? Horse hockey. This is still sick, it s still irresponsible, and it s still cruel and insensitive. It also demonstrates just how sick as a society we ve become where this kind of thing is seen as something to celebrate by so many.Featured image via screen capture from NH1-TV report""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

People all too often die unintentionally   like when  responsible  gun owners leave their weapons lying around and children find them   and while these situations are often called accidents, the true issue is negligence. Simply put, nothing would have happened in many, if not most  accidental  shootings if the gun wasn t present in the first place   or, at minimum, if the owners of the weapons actually cared about gun safety.The NRA regularly promotes the lie that all people who own firearms are  responsible     good guys with guns  who stand ready to leap into action at the first sign of danger (if they manage to help out without shooting the victim of a crime in the head, that is).Once again, one of the Saviors of Mankind  accidentally  discharged a firearm and took another human s life. On Saturday, a gun store owner in Amelia, Ohio was murdered (yes, murdered) when someone taking a concealed weapons class was negligent with his gun. An unnamed participant (whose identity, as is normal, is being protected) in a class at the KayJay Gun Shop   someone who already owned a gun and wanted to carry it around with him everywhere he or she goes was practicing weapon malfunction drills with a handgun that was, for some reason, loaded during a training exercise. The weapon fired and struck shop owner James Baker in the neck.Friends describe Baker, whose shop repairs and engraves firearms, has authorization to manufacture weapons, and is licensed to sell military-grade guns like the one that was used to slaughter fifty people in Orlando, Florida, as a  special  person who was  loved by the whole community. As always, the media and police are treating this as though it was an actual accident, like tripping while walking down the sidewalk. The reality is that this was no accident, and it is time that we stop treating it as such. This was murder. Sure, the person did not intend for it to happen   just like if someone is negligent while driving a car and runs someone over. In the latter case, at least the killer would be charged with a crime   something that rarely happens in  accidental  shootings.The investigation is still ongoing, but we can expect two things to happen: no charges will be filed (after all, it is already being called an  accident ), and Second Amendment advocates will flock to excuse this  accident  before forgetting about it entirely.Perhaps it s time that we end the madness. Maybe, just maybe, we need to reconsider if the Second Amendment should exist in the first place.Watch a report on this latest  accident  below:Featured image via screengrab""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Barack Obama is directly responsible for it, because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al-Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama s failures,  McCain said.Reporters gave McCain a fair chance to walk his comments back but he only repeated his claim. He pulled everybody out of Iraq, and I predicted at the time that ISIS would go unchecked, and there would be attacks on the United States of America. It s a matter of record, so he is directly responsible. You can listen to McCain s remarks below:Not long after, McCain issued a statement claiming he  misspoke  even though he made his remarks twice. I misspoke,  McCain said. I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama s national security decisions, not the President himself. As I have said, President Obama s decision to completely withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 led to the rise of ISIL. I and others have long warned that the failure of the President s policy to deny ISIL safe haven would allow the terrorist organization to inspire, plan, direct or conduct attacks on the United States and Europe as they have done in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino and now Orlando. Of course, McCain is wrong about President Obama pulling the troops out of Iraq. That was a decision made by President Bush in 2008. President Obama merely honored the agreement signed by the former president.But McCain could be the former Senator from Arizona because of his inflammatory accusation against President Obama.As it turns out, donations have been pouring in for his opponent Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick to the tune of at least $100,000 alone since McCain made the remarks. McCain angered many people with his disrespectful comments about President Obama and so they are responding by supporters his challenger.In addition, a poll touted by Kirkpatrick s campaign in the wake of McCain s remarks shows him losing to her by two points.Kirkpatrick spokesman D.B. Mitchell slammed McCain for his remarks and urged people to help oust him from Congress. John McCain s reckless and appalling comments about the Orlando mass shooting disappointed thousands of Arizonans and people from across the nation,  said Kirkpatrick spokesman D.B. Mitchell.  But his actions are just further proof that after 33 years in Washington McCain has changed, and now Americans are witnessing that he s no longer a  maverick.  Arizonans know it s time for new principled leadership, and that s why Ann Kirkpatrick saw the largest one-day fundraising number of the campaign. We need a senator who will put our national security before partisan politics. We must do everything we can to elect Ann to the Senate and we are asking you to make a donation today. John McCain is currently facing one of the toughest re-election efforts for a Republican this year.

This tragedy was brought to you by guns and religion,  Maher said to kick off the discussion.Maher and conservative reporter Emily Miller agreed that only followers of Islam commit acts of terrorism, forgetting mass shootings that were perpetrated by white Christian males such as Dylann Roof, who killed nine black people at a church in Charleston. Or Timothy McVeigh, who committed the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995. He grew up a Roman Catholic and took the Last Rites prior to his execution. And there are so many other examples that they could literally fill this article and more. And here s a list of violence against the LGBT community, some of which were committed by anti-gay Christians with guns.But it was Republican retired Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson who stole the show when he buried Miller and her gun nut views, much to Maher s amusement. We need some kind of control on the weapons in this country,  Wilkerson said.  We do not need large capacity magazines, semi-automatic weapons in the hands of anybody in this country, other than possibly law enforcement. Wilkerson admitted that he owns 14 guns at home because he inherited many them from relatives who passed away, but he only uses them for hunting and is very selective about who he sells a gun to if he wants to let one go.Miller immediately volunteered to buy some guns from Wilkerson and he quickly rejected her.  I wouldn t sell them to you,  he said.Wilkerson went on to hold Republicans responsible for the shooting to some degree because they have refused to pass a law banning people on the terrorism watch list from buying and owning guns.Miller then attempted to defend guns as a necessary tool for home defense but Wilkerson, who served in the Vietnam War, didn t buy that malarkey either, saying that he doesn t own guns to shoot people and pointing out that we have law enforcement to deal with home invasions. When Miller attempted to discuss law enforcement response time, Wilkerson shut her down. I m 71-years-old. I ve lived in this country for seventy-one years, except for the years I was deployed fighting for this country when I did need my guns, and nobody has ever entered my house and tried to kill me!

Priorities!The pride flag was raised just hours after Hillsborough s commissioners voted 5-1 to hang the flag for the remainder of the month both in acknowledgement of it being Pride Month and in honor of the victims of Orlando, many of whom were LGBT and whose killer was reportedly vehemently anti-gay.Rather than see this as a symbol of unity during the wake of a national tragedy, one Republican commissioner, Stacy White, decided to make this all about fake Christian oppression. Apparently, just seeing the rainbow colors has caused one of her constituents to feel like she can t even drive to work. In an email sent to her fellow commissioners, White complains about how the rainbow flag might be harming those with  strong Christian values. Warning: Her letter is bonkers.My office recently received an anonymous phone call from a county employee stating that, because of her strong Christian beliefs, it will be nearly unbearable for her pass the  pride  flag each morning as she enters the workplace. She clearly indicated that the display of that flag, for her, has created a hostile work environment.My question is, given the nature of this employee complaint, has the board s action taken this past Wednesday created any issues for the county from a Human Resources perspective? If the display of this flag exposes the county any liability whatsoever, I request that it be taken down on the basis that the board s action has violated the workplace rights of some of our employees.White closed her letter out by referring to the Pride Flag as a  divisive, politically-charged symbol  inappropriate for  our workplace. In a country that still routinely displays a flag used in the Civil War to rally around slavery on state property, you may need a microscope and a very steady hand to create a violin small enough to play for White s pity party here. It s also particularly astounding that Republicans can somehow take a hate crime perpetuated on (mostly) LGBT Latinos and somehow make it all about them.Ironically, in the days after the shooting, Republicans shamelessly attempted to leverage the raw emotions of the LGBT community to make the, frankly insulting, pitch that the gay community should vote for Republicans because they could keep them safe from Muslims. The LGBT community, having had decades of experience in picking up on when they are being pandered to, gave the GOP a resounding middle finger and instead demanded America solve a much more dangerous problem: Guns.Apparently, having realized gay people weren t taking the bait, Republicans have reverted back to bashing them instead. Now, just a week after the shooting, Commissioner Stacy White is unflinchingly accusing a symbol of their pride of being  unbearable  to Christians. In several other Republican-dominated counties across America, officials have also refused to honor President Obama s request to lower their flags to half-mast based on technicalities. An obnoxious form of grandstanding meant to signal to their most bigoted voters that they don t really like gay people, so please don t vote them out.Thankfully in Hillsborough at least the other commissioners seem to have an ounce of common decency.

HBO s host of Real Time, Bill Maher, wasted no time in ripping Trump a new one on that, and took it a step further and told his viewers what we all already know: Donald Trump is not just an offensive blowhard, he s also an amazing narcissist. Maher began with Trump s racist attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is  presiding over his Trump University case: The judge thing looked selfish. There is no constituency for Trump University except for Donald Trump. And then the first thing out of his mouth after Orlando was,  I was right.  He looks like what he is   a narcissist. One of Maher s panel members, Business Insider Senior Editor Josh Barro, pointed out that the American people have shown better sense than we realize  when it comes to Trump s ridiculously offensive Twitter brag regarding Orlando. He continued: It turns out Americans don t like blatantly racist attacks on the judiciary that also signal that a president might use his own power to support his businesses and defeat his political opponents through untoward things. And then the response to the shooting. I think there had been this idea that if there was terrorism that it would be good for Trump. Bill Maher went so far as to say that this week ended Trump s White House ambitions: I see it as, this was the week it ended. I don t think I m the only one, because most of the Republicans who were caught on camera this week basically said,  I don t want to talk about it. Of course they don t want to talk about it.

It has gotten to the point that even many of the most horrific conservatives can t look past the hate speech and general insanity that has accompanied The Donald s attempt to become Dictator-in-Chief. For the most part, they have been fine with Trump s bigotry: his suggestion that Muslims should be crammed into concentration camps while those not already in the country should be banned, his talk of building walls to keep brown people out of the country, his numerous racist and misogynist statements, and his support of his horrible followers beating African-Americans at his rallies. They ve even been fine with his itchy trigger finger when it comes to launching nuclear weapons.But Trump s recent attacks on a  Mexican  federal judge from Indiana, his rapidly-dropping poll numbers, and his slightly more reasonable remarks about gun safety regulations, have the delegates he has earned ready for mutiny. The Washington Post reports that delegates are hatching plans to stop Trump. While many others have attempted to start movements to end Trump for good, this time it s different   the people who make the rules are the ones leading the movement:The delegates are angered by Trump s recent comments on gun control, his racial attacks on a federal judge and his sinking poll numbers. They are convinced that Trump is an insufficiently conservative candidate and believe they will find enough like-minded Republicans within the next month to change party rules and allow delegates to vote for whomever they want, regardless of who won their state caucus or primary. This literally is an  Anybody but Trump  movement,  said Kendal Unruh, a Republican delegate from Colorado who is leading the campaign.  Nobody has any idea who is going to step in and be the nominee, but we re not worried about that. We re just doing that job to make sure that he s not the face of our party. The fresh wave of anti-Trump organizing comes as a growing number of Republicans have signaled that they will not support Trump for president. In addition, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who is slated to chair the Republican National Convention next month in Cleveland, said in remarks released Friday that House Republicans should  follow their conscience  on whether to support Trump.The new anti-Trump movement is pushing for a change to party rules that would allow them to vote for whomever they want if their  conscience  (term used loosely because our friends on the Right don t have those) doesn t allow them to support that person.On Friday, Trump dismissed the plot against him. I won almost 14 million votes, which is by far more votes than any candidate in the history of the Republican primaries,  Trump said.  I have tremendous support and get the biggest crowds by far and any such move would not only be totally illegal but also a rebuke of the millions of people who feel so strongly about what I am saying. People that I defeated soundly in the primaries will do anything to get a second shot   but there is no mechanism for it to happen,  the billionaire concluded. But those in charge of the latest effort to shut Trump down say they do not have a specific candidate in mind.According to those involved, at least 30 delegates in 15 states have signed on   a small fraction of the more than 2,400 delegates who will be at the convention in Cleveland. Trump just continues to embarrass himself and his party and this is not going to let up,  Iowa GOP delegate Cecil Stinemetz told the Post. Trump just continues to embarrass himself and his party and this is not going to let up. Will the movement succeed? Will Trump continue to embarrass his party and Americans as a whole.Featured image via Getty Images/Rob Jenkins""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Only individuals who make over $1 million could qualify for such a deduction   meaning this bill will target exclusively the 1 percent.The bill, rightfully titled the Top 1% Accountability Act, would require these deduction seekers to submit a drug test proving they aren t using. If they choose not to comply, they can only use the standard deduction of $6,300.Moore, who has been a progressive voice against Republican stigmatization, said she was inspired by the poverty-shaming of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a notorious anti-welfare crusader: When he stood in front of a drug treatment center and rolled out his anti-poverty initiative, pushing this narrative that poor people are drug addicts, that was the last straw. Republicans have been successful in pushing this notion that poor people who receive welfare benefits are responsible for  bankrupting  the country. Less than one percent of the nation s budget goes to these benefits, but Republicans don t care. As long as they can blame the  lazy minorities  and get whites riled up, they re successful.

We spend $81 billion on everything   everything   that you could consider a poverty program   We might really save some money by drug-testing folks on Wall Street, who might have a little cocaine before they get their deal done.

In more recent polls, Clinton is pulling away and there is talk among both conservative and liberal pollsters that this election could very well turn into a complete rout. As Clinton consolidates the Democratic Party and gets to turn her attention to the general election, her poll numbers have been slowly climbing. Trump s on the other hand are in absolute freefall In recent days, Trump has congratulated himself after a mass shooting, accused President Obama of working with ISIS, banned a major newspaper from covering his campaign, and attempted to turn gay people against Muslims.

Since the shooting in Orlando, Trump has doubled down on that insanity, and it s clear that Speaker Ryan has had enough.Ryan sat down on Thursday with The Huffington Post, and when asked about what he d do if Trump tried to pull that sh*t once he was elected, Ryan said: I would sue any president that exceeds his or her powers.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Instead of bowing down to the NRA leader who has never fought in war his entire life, Republicans should be listening to this Iraq War veteran on the issue of guns.For whatever reason, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre managed to weasel his way out of fighting in the Vietnam War even though he was definitely eligible to serve. Depending on the account, LaPierre either secured school deferments or received a bullshit medical discharge like Donald Trump did.Either way, when it comes right down to it LaPierre talks a big game when it comes to guns but he was total coward when it came time to use them to fight for our country.Yet Republicans fear the NRA mouthpiece so much that they literally do whatever he wants them to do when it comes to gun legislation. Every time there is a mass shooting the GOP automatically refuses to pass any gun laws that would prevent future massacres.In fact, Republicans and the NRA are so gun crazy that they even refuse to support any legislation that bans suspected terrorists from buying guns and declined to support a United Nations resolution to ban the sale of firearms in nations that support terrorism. So not only are Republicans and the NRA in favor of not keeping the American people safe here at home, they are in favor of putting our troops in danger abroad, which is precisely why Rep. Seth Moulton called them out this week. I think that Republicans are scared,  the Iraq War veteran told GQ.  Republicans are scared of the NRA. They re scared of the Tea Party. They re scared of their leadership that won t even allow a debate on this issue. The Massachusetts Democrat served four combat tours in Iraq so he knows what he s talking about when it comes to guns and terrorism.When it came time to take action in the wake of the Orlando mass shooting last weekend, Moulton was so disgusting by Republicans only offering  thoughts and prayers  that he refused to take part in a moment of silence House Republicans staged to make themselves feel better instead of actually doing something to prevent gun violence. Moulton walked out of the chamber in protest and received praise on Twitter. I understand I m one of the few members of Congress who does his own Twitter account, so I saw it right away,  Moulton said  Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut was, I think, the first to say,  You know what, I m just not even going to attend these moments of silence.  And I thought that was a good statement. Some people have said,  Well, that s disrespectful to the victims.  I think what s disrespectful to the victims is refusing to even have a debate about passing reasonable reforms to prevent these mass shootings from happening. But Moulton thinks it s going to take many more mass shootings before Republicans wake up and finally take action. Either that or an election that kicks most of them out of Congress. I do not know how many more innocent Americans need to die before we come to our senses on this issue. In just my one term here, we ve already had too many moments of silence to even count. But I do have hope, and that s why I m going to keep fighting. Furthermore, he supports universal background checks and an assault weapons ban, which he believes would have stopped the Orlando shooter from purchasing the AR-15 he used. It is absolutely absurd that someone who is deemed unsafe to get on an airplane is allowed to buy a gun in America. It s truly absurd. And the Republican critique is,  Well, there might be innocent people on the no-fly list.  Look, if you don t trust the no-fly list, then why do you allow it for our airports? Maybe that has something to do with the fact that you fly home every weekend.It s also absurd that we could require universal background checks for some gun purchases but not for others. That s like saying if I go up to the airline ticket counter and purchase a ticket in person, I have to go through security, but if I buy the ticket online I just can bypass security.And an assault-weapons ban would have prevented Omar Mateen from buying this gun in Florida. Moulton also knows for a fact that Donald Trump s campaign rhetoric is putting our troops in more danger. The last time I went overseas on an Armed Services Committee oversight trip, we went to Iraq, Israel, Bahrain, and the UAE, and the number of foreign leaders leaders of our allies who spoke derisively about Trump was embarrassing. It was embarrassing as an American, even as someone who doesn t support Trump. And the things that he s saying are absolutely putting our troops at risk today. But Moulton was not done blasting Trump. Donald Trump obviously knows nothing about what it s like to put your life on the line for your country,  he continued.  He s never risked his life for anything. Neither has Wayne LaPierre, which makes one wonder why Republicans still bow down to cowards like him and Donald Trump.Featured image via Twitter""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

That s how this teacher knows Ali is gay.The message in question said:The teacher, who appears to be a woman named Janice Williams, tried to weasel out of taking responsibility for this when she was asked about the offensive message: My FB account was hacked yesterday and I was not responsible for the message sent to the lady causing her to believe that her child would be harmed. It took several attempts to delete the account after notifying FB that my account had been hacked. I have lived my life protecting the rights of others and being an advocate for ALL children. I m saddened that a hacker can cause such negativity and division among so many people. Please give my sincerest apology to this woman and her child. Thank you.' Oh, bull cookies. Isn t that always the fallback excuse when you write something horrible like that to someone?  My account was hacked.  However, like any sane person would when confronted with something that sounds like so many hollow excuses, Watson called it  garbage. The school district says the t-shirt was  disruptive,  because several students had complained. Like telling LGBTQ students they have to kowtow to the whims of homophobes or be singled out and punished isn t disruptive. Nevertheless, they stood by that decision, issuing a statement that said: Our purpose at CCISD is to educate children, first and foremost.

The student was offered a school shirt to wear and declined. There s more, though.

He doesn t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands. It s one or the other,  Trump said.  And either one is unacceptable. We re led by a man who is a very   look, we re led by a man that either is, is not tough, not smart, or he s got something else in mind. And the something else in mind, you know, people can t believe it. People cannot   they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the ways he acts and can t even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There s something going on. It s inconceivable. But McCain, who is facing one of the toughest re-election campaigns of his political career, went even further than that. Barack Obama is directly responsible for it, because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al-Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama s failures,  McCain said.After being given a chance to clarify his remarks, McCain repeated his claim. He pulled everybody out of Iraq, and I predicted at the time that ISIS would go unchecked, and there would be attacks on the United States of America. It s a matter of record, so he is directly responsible. Here s the audio via the Washington Post.Of course, Trump s campaign manager quickly tweeted what McCain said, most likely thinking they had found an ally for their own attacks against President Obama.John McCain: Obama is  directly responsible  for Orlando attack   The Washington Post https://t.co/hjh5ry2r3B  Corey Lewandowski (@CLewandowski_) June 16, 2016There are many problems with McCain s claims. First of all, the shooter is the one who is  directly responsible  for the mass killing. Second, President Obama followed the order signed by President George W. Bush in 2008 agreeing to pull all US military personnel out of Iraq in 2011 after several attempts to keep troops there were rejected by the Iraqi parliament.Therefore, not only is President Obama not responsible for withdrawing our military forces out of Iraq, ISIS wouldn t have been able to rise if President Bush has not pushed to invade Iraq in the first place. The war in Iraq destabilized the region, thus allowing a terrorist organization like ISIS to form to fill the power vacuum.After much criticism, McCain has been scrambling to spin his remarks ever since. I misspoke. I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama s national security decisions, not the President himself. As I have said, President Obama s decision to completely withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 led to the rise of ISIL. I and others have long warned that the failure of the President s policy to deny ISIL safe haven would allow the terrorist organization to inspire, plan, direct or conduct attacks on the United States and Europe as they have done in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino and now Orlando. Again, it is an established FACT that President Obama did not invade Iraq and did not sign the withdrawal order. Both of those actions occurred before he ever stepped foot in the White House.But McCain was given a chance to clarify his usage of  directly responsible  and said it again instead so it s hard to believe him when he claims to have  misspoke. Also, as a so-called  leader  of his party, one would think that John McCain would be able to at least try and persuade the Republican-controlled Congress to declare war on ISIS so that President Obama can wage a full war with full resources to fight terrorism. But so far, Republicans would rather criticize President Obama for not going to war against ISIS even though the Constitution clearly states that only Congress has the power to declare a war.Clearly, John McCain has served long enough in the Senate. It s time for a new senator from Arizona. Perhaps a real maverick who knows how to be respectful of their commander-in-chief and knows when to keep their mouth shut instead of spewing lies and false accusations.Featured Image: Gage Skidmore""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He s also been blasting President Obama for the way he s handling ISIS, connecting Obama to the Orlando massacre. He just recently stepped that up, claiming again that he was right about all this, and also bringing Hillary Clinton into the ring of his accusations. He even has a source to back all this up now! The big question now is,  Bro, do you even news? USA Today decided to answer that question with,  No, he clearly doesn t.  Why? Because he said: Hillary Clinton received a classified intelligence report stating that the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State. His source for that? Breitbart, which is less reliable than Fox News. They referenced a government memo from 2012 on the situation and called it an  intelligence report.  Trump took that story and used it to gloat about being right about everything:An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump  may have insinuated about @POTUS.  But he s right: https://t.co/bIIdYtvZYw  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2016USA Today, however, looked at that so-called  report,  and found that it doesn t say what either Trump or Breitbart claim. Here s the relevant information:DIA memo, August 2012: A. Internally, events are taking a clear sectarian direction.B. The Salafist, the Muslim Brotherhood, and AQI [Al Qaeda in Iraq] are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria.C. The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support the opposition; while Russia, China, and Iran support the regime.AQI supported the uprising against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad from the beginning, and so did the U.S. That s not a secret in any form of the word, and it takes an amazing leap of twisted logic to assume that means Obama was actively supporting even working with Al Qaeda. USA Today s report says that, for this to be true, several more countries would have to have been involved in this conspiracy, too.Now it s getting so complicated that it defies description.To that end, though, USA Today reached out to several Middle East experts about this. One such expert, Andrew Tabler, said: The US never supported AQ in Iraq   not sure where that came from. Another expert, Perry Cammack, called Breitbart s story  amazingly poor reporting,  and said: If anything the Obama administration has been criticized for doing too little to support the Syrian opposition, and it s frankly for exactly this reason. As far as Hillary s involvement, that s Trump and Breitbart grasping at some very small, slippery straws. While the memo does list the office of the Secretary of State, Cammack says it would likely have been  read by worker bees,  and incorporated into a larger briefing for Hillary to review later.In other words, that notation is meaningless, and Trump s accusation is baseless.USA Today concluded their report by saying that Trump s claims are the kind of conspiracy theories they d debunk in an article, and debunk, they did. They shot down this conspiracy theory rather soundly with basic research of which neither Trump, nor Breitbart, is capable (and they ll eventually be banned for this).Featured image by Mark Lyons/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

While one cannot simply remove the DNC Chairwoman from her position, and while she will retain her title, Wasserman-Schultz has been stripped of most of her power. CNN reports:Hillary Clinton s campaign is taking the reins of the Democratic National Committee, installing a new top official on Thursday to oversee the party s day-to-day operations through the general election.Brandon Davis, national political director for the Service Employees International Union, will become the general election chief of staff for the Democratic Party. His selection formalizes the coordination of the Clinton campaign and the committee, a stark contrast to Donald Trump who is currently at odds with his party.Now, this sort of thing is rather common   but it is expected to alleviate some of Democrats  concerns about Wasserman-Schultz s rather lackluster leadership abilities. This is in fact what happens,  former Democratic Party chairman, Howard Dean, told CNN.  Debbie will still have the title, but somebody else will be the effective operator of the DNC. It s Hillary s pick.  And, of course, Hillary could have picked anyone she wanted (including Wasserman-Schultz). But, of course, she didn t, perhaps realizing that the Chairwoman is not the right fit for this or many other jobs. We basically just turned it over to him and I left the building to him. He ran the DNC,  Dean said, explaining how he transitioned to simply raising money for Barack Obama after his campaign took over the party.  It was very clear I wasn t going to be running the DNC as soon as there was a nominee. It has long been suspected that DWS was working in cahoots with the Clinton campaign. While it is true that the Democratic nominee has benefited from the party leader s numerous blunders   including a terrible debate schedule that kept the party out of the public eye   it seems that it was just incompetence that appeared to be assistance. Or, if Debbie was providing assistance in hopes of a reward, Clinton did not return the favor. In any case, the Democratic Party is stronger with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz sidelined.This decision comes on the heels of a meeting between Clitnon and Bernie Sanders, who has long called for new leadership in the DNC. Sen. Sanders and Secretary Clinton met in Washington on Tuesday evening and had a positive discussion about how best to bring more people into the political process and about the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation,  said Michael Briggs, Sanders  spokesman, in a statement following the meeting.  Sanders congratulated Secretary Clinton on the campaign she has run and said he appreciated her strong commitment to stopping Trump in the general election. It is unknown how or if Sanders influenced Clinton s decision to strip Wasserman-Schultz of power. We have a lot of work to do over the next five months to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president,  Clinton campaign manager, Robby Mook, said while introducing Davis to the party s staff.  With so much at stake in this election, we could not ask for a better partner in that mission than the team here. Now, we just need an election to make this  firing  permanent.Featured image via Getty Images/Andrew Burton""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

This follows the mass shooting that recently happened at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The shooting resulted in the loss of 49 lives, with more than that number being hospitalized with serious injuries. The shooting is the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. The shooter, Omar Mateen, purchased the assault weapon two weeks before he executed his massacre at the night club. Mateen was able to legally buy the firearm despite the fact that he had been previously under investigation by the FBI.Since the shooting, the U.S. has once again taken up the ritual of crying out for our leaders to do something to   well, to make this stop. However, no real progress has been made in the effort to create more regulations for assault weapons, or return to outright banning them as the Boston Globe editorial calls for.The case for banning assault weapons is laid out clearly in the editorial. People have been able to purchase assault weapons legally since 2004. After the assault weapons ban was repealed, they have been used in massacres across the United States. They name six Senators whom they asses are responsible for blockading legislation that might actually do something to make this stop. Five of the Senators are Republicans, one of them is a Democrat.

First, he apologized for treating LGBTQ people poorly in the past. From Vox:Cox started off saying that he had  an admission and an apology  for the vigil attendees:  I recognize fully that I am a balding, youngish, middle-aged straight, white, male, Republican politician  (many in the crowd burst into laughter at this)  with all of the expectations and privileges that come with those labels. I am probably not who you expected to hear from today. After that humble introduction, Cox went on to say: I m here because yesterday morning, 49 Americans were brutally murdered.   I m here because those 49 people were gay. I m here because it shouldn t matter. But I m here because it does. That is perhaps, to me as a gay American, the most moving part of the speech, period. It shows that he isn t erasing us, that he understands that no amount of rallying in the streets, pride parades, people coming out in support of marriage equality, or anything else changes the fact that this community has suffered terrible amounts of violence, indignity, disrespect, and despair, all for the simple  crime  of existing. Cox went on to address the problem of straight-splaining, and admits that while he stands with us, he cannot know what it is like to walk a mile in our shoes: I am not here to tell you that I know exactly what you are going through. I am not here to tell you that I feel your pain. I don t pretend to know the depths of what you are feeling right now. But I do know what it feels like to be scared. And I do know what it feels like to be sad. And I do know what it feels like to be rejected. And, more importantly, I know what it feels like to be loved. The speech went on to call the victims  beautiful, amazing people,  and Cox was tearful throughout. This speech is not the only thing Cox has done to show his allegiance and support though. He was a vocal supporter of a Utah law that forbade discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.There is so much more than what I have written here in this beautiful, moving 9:39 speech.

But now, the AMA is fighting back, pledging to actively lobby Congress: With approximately 30,000 men, women and children dying each year at the barrel of a gun in elementary schools, movie theaters, workplaces, houses of worship and on live television, the United States faces a public health crisis of gun violence. Even as America faces a crisis unrivaled in any other developed country, the Congress prohibits the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from conducting the very research that would help us understand the problems associated with gun violence and determine how to reduce the high rate of firearm-related deaths and injuries. Thanks to GOP obstructionism, a lift on the CDC s investigation into gun violence was stalled when Senate Republicans blocked funding for the research. Stack stressed the importance of allowing such research, saying that figuring out why the epidemic continues is  vital so physicians and other health providers, law enforcement and society at large may be able to prevent injury, death and other harms to society resulting from firearms. And before the NRA nuts accuse the AMA of unconstitutional activism, it should be noted that the only stake the AMA has in this research is  the safety of firearms and their use, and reducing and preventing firearm violence.

Nope, not even a vote. Not even a chance.Apparently, the House GOP doesn t want anything added to the annual spending bills for fear that it may inhibit passage. You know, because adding non-discriminatory amendments for LGBT people in a House of Representatives full of GOP bigots doesn t go over well and could clog up business as usual.As The Hill explains:House GOP leaders decided to clamp down on amendments to annual spending bills after Maloney s proposal threatened passage of other appropriations measures last month. Before now, Republicans had been considering appropriations bills under a procedure allowing members of either party to offer unlimited amendments.Don t you see, they only want to play by their rules. If you re not doing something they like, well, then they will make sure it never happens, but guaranteed if it was the other way around, the story would be verrrry different.This just proves, yet again, that Republicans only care about themselves.Featured Photo by Allison Shelley/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Takei, and many in the LGBT community, took the attack personally. Why wouldn t they? It was a terrorist attack, but it was also a very specifically targeted hate crime. It was an attack on all LGBT people. Takei argues that they were not the only community targeted, though. Nearly every casualty was also Latino. Those two communities is where Takei sees opportunity..Takei, a liberal, was very fair in his assessment, but he argues that the Second Amendment is in direct opposition to the First Amendment, especially in situations like mass shootings.For the average American, it is the First Amendment that articulates many of our most basic and fundamental civil rights: freedom of speech and of worship, but also of assembly and association. On Sunday, the latter two rights came under direct assault for the LGBT community. There is little doubt, for instance, that the killer targeted his victims out of hate. He intended to strike not just at people, but at a closely-knit community. After all, if his goal were sheer bloodshed and horror, Orlando boasts far more tempting and, some might even argue, more  sympathetic  targets. The killer apparently had issues with gay people; his father stated that, two weeks prior, his son  got very angry  at the mere sight of two men kissing in public, and even angrier that his own boy should witness it. At the same time, the killer was known to frequent the very establishment he attacked, suggesting that he may have deeply internalized the hate he heard from religious extremists.Takei didn t give ISIS a pass. He mentioned that they hate gay people and that the shooter claimed allegiance with the terrorist organization, but the fight to stop gay marriage and the fight to criminalize bathroom usage by transgender people pretty much shows that our attitudes aren t much better.Takei goes on to say that freedoms, even those guaranteed by the Constitution, have limits:But this is not so rare a circumstance. Indeed, there is no freedom within the Bill of Rights that is absolute. Even freedom of speech, a bedrock of our participatory democracy, has some established limits. I may not jokingly yell  fire  inside a crowded theater, precisely because the value of that speech is heavily outweighed by the danger to others who might panic. Nor may I cavalierly libel others without fear of legal repercussions. This is because we have decided, as a society, that the cost of the injuries that might arise outweighs any benefit from the freedom to say whatever I want.Takei is done with the gun debate. He has no desire to get rid of the Second Amendment, but he sees no reason everyday American should have assault rifles. He s ready to take on that fight, with a little help from his friends and he feels the LGBT community has spent the past several decades getting ready:Now this latest and most deadly attack has targeted a group that has spent the last few decades learning how to organize, fight for, and protect its rights. Perhaps, then, the next chapter of LGBT history might not be just about the struggle to gain equality for ourselves, but also how we might help lead this country towards a collective right to participate and live free of fear and terror, and ultimately toward a common-sense, permanent ban on weapons designed for mass slaughter.Like it or not, this history and this obligation have been thrust upon us, and we must now rise to its challenge. For if there is one group in this country with more will, more experience, and more tenacity than the NRA, it is the LGBT community.You don t want to mess with us.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic with Getty Images.

But the most surprising thing about these numbers is that in December of last year, only 44 percent of Americans supported a ban. That s a thirteen point difference in just six months.The poll also shows a shocking statistic   almost half of Republicans (45 percent) support the ban, while 78 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Independents do.According to the poll:On whether laws governing gun sales should be made more strict, Americans seem split along party lines. A majority   57 percent   believe that laws should be stricter, while 11 percent believe they should be less strict. About three in ten Americans think they should be kept as is.Not surprisingly, Republicans were in the minority on this issue as well.The overwhelming majority of Americans support such a ban, and only one candidate wants to see that happen   Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump doesn t because, in his own words, there are already too many of them on the streets so it would be fruitless (but deporting 11 million immigrants in this country? No problem).There is no doubt that the number has risen thanks to the ever eminent threat of mass gun violence plaguing this nation, and the attack in Orlando certainly didn t ease any fears.When it comes to the issues of expanding background checks, all political ideologies are in agreement. Over 92 percent of Republicans, 97 percent of Democrats, and 82 percent of Independents support stricter, universal background checks.If this trend continues, guns will become a serious policy point in the upcoming election (as it should be), and with the two candidates taking completely different approaches, the difference could not be starker.Featured image via David McNew/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

One of those preachers is Roger Jiminez of Sacramento, California s Verity Baptist Church. He posted a  sermon  that spread like wildfire where he said: As a Christian, we shouldn t be mourning the death of 50 sodomites. Let me go ahead and start right there. As a Christian, we shouldn t be sad or upset. Thankfully, YouTube has removed Jiminez s rant due to violations of its hate speech policy. Jiminez, however, is holding to the beliefs expressed in the sermon, and even goes so far as to suggest that the government should be killing people for being LGBT. Firstly, he says that he does not have one iota of remorse for posting his hateful video: The bible does teach that homosexuality deserves the death penalty. Leviticus 20:13 says that if a man lie with mankind like he does with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination and will surely be put to death. Romans 1 says that they which commit such things are worthy of death. Jiminez went on to add that, if people die who deserve to die, we don t need to be mourning that.  Perhaps the one redeeming quality this horrible excuse for a human being has is that he has no love lost for the shooter either: This gunman there that shot people up, the bible says he deserves to die, he died and we shouldn t be mourning his death, either. That s the whole point I was making, and it s been taken out of context. But then, he goes on to essentially incite violence while saying he s not inciting violence, all the while calling on the government to execute LGBTQ people: I m not calling people to arms. And I m not telling people they should go do this  What I m saying is that if the government followed the laws of God, that s what they would be doing. And if the government did that, I d be fine with that. I would be fine. I would be totally okay with that, if the government did that. That s what they would do, if we lived in a righteous nation. In other words, this Jiminez character is essentially calling for a queer holocaust, right here in America in 2016. This is where the government really should draw the line. Whether Jiminez is calling people to arms or not, this is the sort of hate speech that causes situations like Orlando s tragic massacre. This is literally giving deranged, hateful individuals permission to go out and kill people they deem worthy of death.It s Roger Jiminez that the government needs to be doing something about, not LGBTQ people.Watch the nauseating remarks below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

These would be our bigots the ones who are working feverishly on keeping the LGBTQ community down by dehumanizing them, and painting them as an evil in our society.These people s hatred led to Omar Mateen killing 49 people in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. A Facebook post, which ends with,  You weren t the gunman, but you re the culture that built him. You re the bullets in his gun,  is the sheer, naked truth of the situation.There are those who are angry about the  politicization  of Orlando. If those people would wake up to what s really happening, they d see that it was political from the start.Why? Because we have all of this bigotry coming from our very own lawmakers, pundits, and analysts, who want that bigotry codified in law so they can stay on top of their golden pedestals. We have pastors and other religious leaders who are celebrating what happened in Orlando. And they think they haven t contributed to this? Here are the faces of some of those people, complete with a simple phrase that adds to the power of the above post:Furthermore, the LGBTQ community has been assaulted over and over, by the same cold-blooded fuckery that caused Orlando, with GOP presidential candidates  opposition to marriage equality, too: I support same sex civil unions but to me, and millions like me, marriage is a religious service not a government form.    Ben Carson I have already introduced a constitutional amendment to preserve the authority of elected state legislatures to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman, and also legislation stripping the federal courts of jurisdiction over legal assaults on marriage.    Ted Cruz Throughout the millennia and in every religion in the world, marriage has a very specific meaning. Marriage is a institution [sic] grounded in spirituality. It is the union of a man and a woman, and from that union comes life, and life is a gift from God.    Carly Fiorina We must resist and reject judicial tyranny, not retreat. This ruling is not about marriage equality, it s about marriage redefinition. This irrational, unconstitutional rejection of the expressed will of the people in over 30 states will prove to be one of the court s most disastrous decisions, and they have had many.    Mike Huckabee [Obergefell] will pave the way for an all out assault against the religious freedom rights of Christians who disagree with this decision. This ruling must not be used as pretext by Washington to erode our right to religious liberty.    Bobby Jindal I am disappointed the Supreme Court today chose to change the centuries old definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. I m a firm believer in traditional marriage, and I also believe the 10th Amendment leaves it to each state to decide this issue. I fundamentally disagree with the court rewriting the law and assaulting the 10th Amendment.    Rick Perry We have to reclaim marriage as an institution that s not about two adults or more than two adults. That it s about children. Marriage has always been about children.    Rick SantorumAnd last, and we certainly wish least, Donald Trump: I would strongly consider [appointing justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage.] Then there s North Carolina s bathroom law, and Governor Pat McCrory, who defended it by saying it was a privacy issue. Yes, privacy for everyone except transgender people. One has to wonder if residents of North Carolina have to carry their birth certificates with them now.There was also Florida governor Rick Scott, who refused to acknowledge Orlando as an anti-LGBTQ hate crime in addition to an act of terrorism. He said Florida s LGBTQ community can engage in the oh-so-effective practice of prayer if they want to be safe.We had Kim Davis, who refused to abide by the Obergefell decision and who the religious community celebrated for standing up for the right to discriminate. The same is true of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore. They re seen as champions of religious freedom, rather than the purveyors of hate they really are.What all of this does is tell ordinary citizens that it s just peachy keen for them to be hateful and evil towards the LGBTQ community. It also causes severe self-loathing in people who try to subscribe to those beliefs, but are LGBTQ and still in the closet. When these things reach the breaking point and explode, they do so violently, as they did in Orlando. You re the bullets in his gun.  Yes, they all were. They don t have to be Mateen, or anybody else who commits a hate crime against the LGBTQ community, to be responsible for this.Featured image by Gerardo Mora/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

What the President actually said makes perfect sense, if you re not Donald Trump or his legion of morons.  There has not been a moment in my seven and a half years as President where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn t use the label,  radical Islam.  The President pointed out that none of his advisors has ever told him we will  turn that whole thing around  if he begins using the ridiculous Fox News-coined phrase that Trump keeps spewing. The phrase,  Radical Islam  isn t a strategy, Obama pointed out. It s a talking point.Naturally, this made Trump angry. Most people get upset when someone points out that they are mind-numbingly stupid.

But ever since the Orlando mass shooting, Republicans have been finding themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place.Trump renewed his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States and expanded the idea by calling for banning anybody from a nation that has a history of terrorism against the United States. That could technically mean Japan and Germany as well as many other nations that are now our allies.Trump also claimed that President Obama is weak on terrorism because he hasn t used certain words to somehow make ISIS magically disappear.In response, President Obama took Trump to the woodshed. What exactly would using this language accomplish?  Obama angrily asked.  What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to try and kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. President Obama also strongly condemned Trump s proposed ban on Muslims. Are we going to start treating all Muslim-Americans differently? Are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance? Are we going to start discriminating them because of their faith? We ve heard these suggestions during the course of this campaign. Do Republican officials actually agree with this? Because that s not the America we want. It doesn t reflect our Democratic ideals. It will make us less safe. And in a stunning move, many Republicans have joined President Obama to condemn Trump. I do not think a Muslim ban is in our country s interest,  House Speaker Paul Ryan responded.  I do not think it is reflective of our principles, not just as a party but as a country. Traditionally, it is a time when people rally around our country, and it s obviously not what s occurred, and it s very disappointing,  said Senator Bob Corker.  It wasn t the type (of address) that one would expect a person who is wanting to lead the greatest nation in the world to make.Senator Lindsey Graham also expressed a lack of confidence in Trump s leadership qualifications.

Adam Kinzinger also condemned Trump perhaps more strongly than his GOP colleagues. I guess I appreciate Mr. Trump s fieriness in talking about it, but you don t do it by alienating the very people that we need, and those are moderate Muslims. We have to use the folks that frankly are not radicalized, which is the vast majority of Muslims, to win this war. Kinzinger would know since, unlike Trump, he served his country by fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan as a pilot. He knows that it s important to have Muslim allies on the ground feeding intelligence and offering support to our troops.Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake also criticized Trump and pointed out that he has to do better if he wants to get enough votes in November. He s won 13 million votes total so far; he s got to get 65 million or so to win the general election, which includes a lot of independents and Republicans that don t feel as he does. He can t win the general election talking the way he is. And these reactions are just the tip of the iceberg. Yet somehow, many of these Republicans STILL support Trump as the nominee and standard-bearer of their party.But that doesn t change the fact that for the first time Republicans and President Obama have united in agreement on something. Donald Trump is dangerous and he is unqualified to be president. It s just up to Republicans whether or not he remains the nominee.

They asked about a  suspect s  political beliefs and activities, and to give them the names of others who might have been involved in subversive activities.Failure to comply meant getting sent to prison for contempt of Congress. Victims of the committee would also lose their jobs, and their employers would blacklist them, making it impossible for them to get another job once they were out of prison.In short, the House Un-American Activities Committee was engaged in a decades-long witch hunt.And that is what Newt Gingrich wants to bring back. Oh, sure, it s all for the safety of the country, so nobody should really object, right? Wrong. He d change his tune real quick if he were pulled in front of just such a committee and then saw his life ruined for it.

Following the massacre in Orlando, though, it seems that Senate Republicans can t stomach the thought of even mentioning Trump s name anymore. On Capitol Hill, the mood is one of depression, fatigue, and giving up and of simmering anger.Instead of being classy and offering condolences, or even just saying he was saddened at the loss of so many lives, Trump gloated over being right about radical Islam, and said we need toughness and vigilance. Then he expanded his  ban all Muslims  policy proposal to include people from any country with any history of terrorism, and said he d accomplish that through executive order.Can we say  despotic? He also blamed Obama for the attack by calling him weak, and insinuating he might even be helping the terrorists.That might be what his drone-like fans want to hear, but putting the blame on Obama was what sent Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) over the edge on Trump. He told Politico: I m not going to be commenting on presidential candidates today. That s it. That s all. He s spent a lot of time explaining what Trump needs to do differently, and how he needs to tone it down, and it s fallen on deaf ears. So, at least for a day, McConnell is done.Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX), the number two Republican in the Senate, also brushed off any discussion of Trump   except he s so sick of the guy that he went several steps further than McConnell. He doesn t plan on talking about Trump at all for the next five months. He ended his talk with Politico by saying: Wish me luck. He s going to need it.Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), whose name has been bandied about as a possible VP pick for Trump, is upset about what Trump said during a foreign policy speech following Orlando. Politico says Corker is normally very talkative, but he would only say: I don t know that I really have a lot to say. Apparently he said that twice, but he eventually spoke a little bit about King Trump s speech: It wasn t the type (of address) that one would expect a person who is wanting to lead the greatest nation in the world to make. Fifty people have perished, and [53] more have been harmed. Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Richard Burr (R-NC) had nothing to say about Trump at all, according to Politico, except for a hurried comment from Burr about going to read Trump s speech. He then disappeared into an elevator.Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) also slammed Trump s remarks, saying: I think his comments are inappropriate when the nation is in mourning over the worst terrorism attack that we ve had since 9/11. She s not even sure she ll be able to make herself vote for Trump, according to Politico.Trump s more outspoken critics on Capitol Hill, such as Senators Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), continued to be outspoken as they slammed Trump s reaction to Orlando. But it was Flake s comments that hint at the strong possibility that Trump just sounded the death knell for his own campaign: He s won 13 million votes total so far; he s got to get 65 million or so to win the general election, which includes a lot of independents and Republicans that don t feel as he does. He can t win the general election talking the way he is. The latest Bloomberg poll shows Hillary Clinton leading Trump nationally by 12 points. Bloomberg says that Orlando has had little effect on the 2016 campaign, but that s likely to change as Trump continues to try and talk tough and falls flat on face with those who are reluctant about supporting him.Senate Republicans have been hoping for months that he would stop being the offensive, bombastic candidate that embodies everything shameful about America s conservative wing. But he s a particular problem for the Senate, because he could end up being the reason Republicans lose both the White House and the Senate in November.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

And, not surprisingly, they overwhelmingly prefer a Clinton presidency.According to a new poll released from Bloomberg, Hillary Clinton crushes right-wing blowhard Donald Trump by a whopping 12 points, 49-37 percent.Not only does the poll show Clinton with a commanding lead, 55 percent of respondents said they could never vote for Donald Trump. Astoundingly, 63 percent of women polled said they could never vote for him. Republicans need to figure out their next move quickly, because there is no way in hell their candidate can win if more than half of the country refuses to vote for him. Seeing that the poll was conducted when the shooting in Florida happened, Trump, hoping to cash in on a wave of fear, has a rude awakening.And the new poll shows Trump s biggest area of support, white men, may not be enough:For his part, Trump is winning 50 percent support from white men, compared to 33 percent for Clinton and 13 percent for Johnson. He s getting 54 percent support among evangelical Christians, while Clinton gets 36 percent from that group.White men are among Trump s strongest demographics. But even there he s not showing as much strength as the party s last nominee, Mitt Romney, who beat Obama in 2012 by 62 percent to 35 percent among white men, according to exit pollsLibertarian candidate Gary Johnson takes a commanding 9 percent of the vote, while 4 percent remain unsure and 1 percent said they will not be voting. It s no secret that Johnson s lead can be attributed to Trump s alienation of non-crazy Republicans.Ann Selzer, who oversaw the poll, said: Clinton has a number of advantages in this poll, in addition to her lead. Her supporters are more enthusiastic than Trump s and more voters overall see her becoming a more appealing candidate than say that for Trump. And what s even better: Americans aren t buying into Trump s racism and bigotry:Trump s suggestions that Obama hasn t taken forceful enough action to stop domestic terrorism because he sides with Muslims landed with a thud for the majority of Americans, with 61 percent disagreeing with the suggestion. A strong majority 69 percent also disagree that law enforcement agencies should increase surveillance of all American Muslims, even if it conflicts with civil liberties.While Trump is only slightly favored to handle issues of terrorism and violence, Clinton isn t far behind. And as the nation continues to be exposed to Trump s extremist  policies  on how to handle such situations, Clinton s numbers could rise.Trump is in trouble, and Republicans know it.

Bondi, who was almost rendered speechless, quickly pivoted to defending her bigotry, stating that she had an obligation under the Florida Constitution to defend marriage as being between one man and one woman. Bondi then chastised Cooper for making her look like she hates gay people.But Anderson Cooper wouldn t let her off the hook. he reminded her that her use of the term  public harm  was in of itself harmful to the LGBT community, and when Bondi tried to backtrack, and Cooper again called her out for it, she did what any conservative would do   she blamed it on her lawyer.Moving on, Cooper then blasted her over the  sick irony  that Bondi set up a help center for the married LGBT couples who lost a spouse in the attack when her defense of banning same-sex marriage would not have allowed them such access. As usual, she pivoted, saying her position is not a champion of the LGBT movement, but to  human beings who have lost their lives.

He famously accused John McCain of being a loser because he was captured and tortured by the North Vietnamese (while Trump was sitting out the war). He more recently used the military to avoid partaking in an uncomfortable primary debate and then refused to give veterans the money he raised until he was exposed.And now, in a moment that is sure to be Hillary Clinton s very next campaign ad, Trump accused unnamed Iraq War veterans of stealing millions of dollars from the U.S. government that was meant to help rebuild the war-torn country. If it s not immediately obvious, that would be a massive crime. Trump tossed around the accusation almost casually.Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump, ladies and gentlemen: Iraq, crooked as hell. How about bringing baskets of money? Millions and millions of dollars and handing it out? I want to know, who were the soldiers who had that job? Because I think they re living very well right now. Trump, as could be expected, offers absolutely zero proof that this took place. Another conspiracy to add to his vault full of them.In fact, the soldiers who returned home from Iraq are not doing  very well right now.  Having served their country in a war without a clear objective, they got back to discover that the Republicans who sent them there now had no interest in helping them. Struggling with war injuries both physical and psychological, high rates of suicide and devastating unemployment, the veterans of the most wealthy nation on earth were kicked to the curb.In 2014, Senate Republicans unilaterally killed a  sweeping $21 billion bill  that would have  expanded medical, educational and other benefits  for these troops. Their reasoning? It s an  entitlement  that we cannot afford.Republicans have charged the bill was too expensive and disputed the way it would be paid for with overseas contingency operations funds used to fund the war in Afghanistan. And that, Republicans argued, wouldn t amount to real savings, since the money wouldn t have been spent anyway with the war winding down by year s end.If there were baskets of money sent to Iraq. It certainly doesn t seem like the troops who served there came home with any.Kudos to Donald Trump. In a week where one might have assumed accusing the President of the United States of helping ISIS was the lowest thing he could do, he managed to dig a little deeper. It s a wonder he has any supporters left.UPDATE: As expected, Donald Trump s campaign has rushed to do damage control. Spokesperson Hope Hicks claimed Trump was referring to Iraqi soldiers, not American ones. A blatant lie given the exact quote (go back and re-read it), but undermined even further by the fact that, as Charles Johnson of Little Green Footballs noted, Trump has previously made a similar claim about American soldiers stealing money (as far back as 2015).He also suggested that some American soldiers charged with distributing money to fund the Afghan and Iraqi government embezzled it instead.  I want to know who are the soldiers carrying suitcases with $50m?  asked Trump.  How stupid are we? I wouldn t be surprised if those soldiers, if the cash didn t get there.

It appears as though the brutal massacre in Orlando might gave actually been more deadly because of the involvement of police.The police allegedly screwed up on two different fronts early Sunday morning, when they took more than three hours to storm the club and some of the casualties may have been from the bullets fired by the first responders.(Orlando Police Chief, John Mina said)  I will say that is all part of the investigation. But I will say when our SWAT officers, about eight or nine officers, opened fire, their backdrop was a concrete wall. And they were being fired upon, so that is all part of the investigation. We had a team of crisis negotiators that talked to the suspect, trying to get as much information as possible, what we could do to help resolve the situation  He wasn t asking a whole lot, and we were doing most of the asking,  Mina said.But Mateen soon began talking about explosives and bombs, leading Mina to decide about 5am to detonate an explosive on an exterior wall to prevent potentially greater loss of life.The explosives did not penetrate the wall completely, so an armored vehicle was used to punch a two-foot-by-three-foot hole in the wall about two feet from the ground. We knew there would be an imminent loss of life,  Mina said.Source: Daily MailThe intent of this article is not to second guess the Orlando police, not at all. But, this does completely debunk the NRA s (and Republicans ) good guy with a gun theory. Inside a crowded nightclub, it s hard to know where bullets are coming from and it s easy to accidentally hurt people you didn t mean to. This is from trained professionals   imagine a bunch of untrained civilians with handguns.Donald Trump and others say that if there were more guns that fateful morning, there would have been fewer casualties. If you had guns in that room, if you had   even if you had a number of people having them strapped to their ankle or strapped to their waist where bullets could have flown in the other direction right at him, you wouldn t have had that tragedy,  Trump said.Source: Huffington PostThere actually was a good guy with a gun there, there was an armed security guard, but he wan t able to prevent over 100 casualties. There s absolutely no chance that an entire club filled with armed patrons wouldn t have ended even worse than the tragic outcome we already had. The FBI knows this. In fact, a 2005 study found that people who run and call the police have a much better chance of survival than people who try to stand up to a shooter. This is a direct contradiction to a study done earlier by the very same person that is often quoted by the NRA. In other words, good guys with guns can be very dangerous in situations with bad guys with guns. The Orlando police admit it. It s time the NRA does too.Featured image of presumed  good guy with a gun  via Getty Images. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

There s no doubt Omar Mateen was able to kill so many people because he was firing an AR-15,  Carlson said.  A military-style assault weapon, a weapon easier to buy in the state of Florida than buying a handgun. Florida sets a three day waiting period for purchasing handguns, but the state mandates no waiting period for any gun that requires two hands to hold. Carlson s remarks on Florida gun laws appear to be a rebuke of Florida Governor Rick Scott, who not only just offered thoughts and prayers instead of acting to prevent future mass shootings in response to Orlando, he s the one who weakened Florida s gun laws over the last five years.Carlson further justified her stance by pointing out that 58 percent of Americans support a ban on assault weapons. Do we need AR-15s to hunt and kill deer? Do we need them to protect our families?  she continued.  I m in favor of people being able to carry. I think some of these mass shootings would have been less deadly if that were the case. But despite her support of Second Amendment rights, Carlson said banning assault weapons is just  common sense  and stated that it is time for Americans to take a stand in order to prevent mass shootings in the future. But I m also with the majority today, taking a stand. Can t we hold true the sanctity of the Second Amendment while still having common sense? 89 percent of Fox viewers, however, refused to shake off the brainwashing the NRA has drilled into them over the years by overwhelmingly rejecting passage of a new assault weapons ban.Here s the video via YouTube.America once did have a ban on assault weapons in place, but Republicans let it expire and refused to renew it. And mass shootings have increased ever since.According to the New Century Foundation in 2012,In the eight years since the Assault Weapons Ban has expired, there have been 28 mass shooting events. That equals an average of 3.5 a year an increase of over 200 percent. That is a startling jump, by any measure.During the ten year duration of the ban between 1994 and 2004, there were 15 mass shootings. In 2015 alone there were at least six major mass shootings that occurred, more depending on what statistics and definition you use. So this is a continuing problem that isn t going away by praying. It s going to take action such as the action taken by Australia in 1996. After five mass shootings between 1987 and 1996, the country finally had enough of the carnage and banned assault weapons. There hasn t been a mass shooting ever since.But it s different in the United States. We have a Second Amendment, therefore it is harder to ban guns entirely. However, banning assault weapons isn t the only change we could demand. We also need better background checks and we need law enforcement to have the ability to ban people from having guns if they are on the terrorist watch list. Had Republicans not refused to do that latter action, perhaps those 50 people would be alive today because Mateen, who was an ISIS sympathizer, would not have been able to legally buy the AR-15 he used to slaughter them.Gretchen Carlson deserves props for supporting a ban on assault weapons, even though she definitely risks being fired for doing so.Featured Image: Screenshot ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Of course, that describes every socially awkward Amazon junkie neighbor I have, or nearly everyone in the 21st Century, but hey, the woman should have reported that to the police, right? According to Trump, that should have been her legal duty.A man who claimed to be friends with this neighbor said she did not report the packages and the behavior to authorities because she  didn t want to do any kind of racial profiling. In Trump s America, however, that woman would face serious consequences.  We need to make sure every single person involved in this plan, including anyone who knew something, but didn t tell us, is brought to justice,  Trump said in New Hampshire.  These people need to have consequences, big consequences. Source: Huffington PostThink about that for a moment. This is coming from the same party that thinks we shouldn t have hate crime laws because gunning down over 100 LGBT people is just a  thought crime.  Trump, who also wants to ban all Muslims and deport anyone with dark skin, wants anyone who hates their neighbors and all their damn UPS packages to call the cops, or perhaps go to jail. Maybe we can call that the  Minority Report  law, which would serve two purposes. We can turn in neighbors for crimes we imagine might happen, and bonus points if the neighbor we report belongs to a minority.There is actually a law on the book that would deal with neighbors who are aware of a crime happening or about to happen  it s called aiding and abetting. It would take a big stretch of the right-wing of the law, though, to call knowledge of package delivery and tinkering in one s garage, as helping commit a crime. Trump, though, appears to have no issues with throwing down the gauntlet of the law over virtually every offense. If you ve ever needed proof he s running for Dictator in Chief, this should be it.Truthfully, Trump s entire reaction to the horrific shooting in Orlando, in which 49 people were slaughtered and 52 people injured, shows how unqualified Trump is for president. First, he congratulated himself, then, he reaffirmed his ban on Muslims, then, he blamed the President. Now, he s blaming neighbors.

They likely do this so they can craft a statement that makes themselves and all gun owners out to be the real victims, instead of calling the shooting what it was and using their considerable clout to work on doing something real about it.In the case of the Orlando massacre, they re saying Obama s politically correct refusal to actually go after radical Islamic terrorists is what caused this. Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA s Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA), wrote an op-ed that was published in USA Today about the whole tragedy. As expected, he toed the party line instead of saying something of substance. But the real gem was the second paragraph: The terrorist in Orlando had been investigated multiple times by the FBI. He had a government-approved security guard license with a contractor for the Department of Homeland Security. Yet his former co-workers reported violent and racist comments. Unfortunately, the Obama administration s political correctness prevented anything from being done about it. Funny thing is, he just debunked the NRA s whole argument that this is Obama s fault right there. By mentioning how Omar Mateen was on the FBI s radar for possible ties to terrorist groups, Cox completely destroyed his own argument. Mateen was able to get his guns legally despite having been the subject of two FBI investigations for ties to radical Islamic groups because of the NRA, not Obama, and certainly not  political correctness. Mateen had no criminal record and already had a concealed carry permit as a licensed security officer. It s not clear whether he was on any terror watch lists, but even if he had been, he may still have been legally able to buy guns. Senate Republicans might have been able to stop this, but instead, they killed a bill that would have prevented suspected terrorists from buying guns last year, on the grounds that it would only hurt innocent Americans who happen to end up on that list for no reason.They ll do anything to maintain their A+ ratings with the NRA. Who cares who dies? The NRA s blessings are the only things that matter here.For its own part, the NRA-ILA once wrote about a study saying criminals don t get their guns legally anyway. The implication there is that we can t stop criminals from getting guns, so everything we could do to prevent even some criminals from getting guns is pointless.In fact, the NRA s policies actually serve to arm criminals, potential terrorists and other violent people more easily. John Fugelsang said it perfectly with this tweet:Guns don t kill ppl, but NRA ppl who own Congress ppl make it very easy for deranged ppl to get guns & kill innocent ppl.  John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) June 14, 2016But we don t need a tweet to prove this. The Coalition To Stop Gun Violence has a list of all the ways the NRA s work actually arms dangerous people:For details on just how the NRA accomplishes each of these items, click on the link above.The laxness that allowed Mateen to get his guns exists because of the NRA s  more guns everywhere  crusade. The massacre at the Pulse nightclub didn t happen because Obama is too weak and politically correct to do something about radical Islamic terrorism. It happened in large part because the NRA created the very environment that allowed Mateen to get his guns. To blame Obama and his  political correctness  is a gross and disgusting insult to everyone who has died at the hands of someone with a gun. Guns don t kill people, people kill people,  is what the NRA s entire agenda boils down to. But a gun makes it far, far easier for a murderer to murder.

Apparently tired of hearing this line of bullshit, President Obama struck back with logic and reason during remarks at the Treasury Department. What exactly would using this language accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to try and kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction,  Obama continued before making it clear to anyone who thinks the administration is  confused  should tell that to all the terrorists who have been killed or captured by our military. The men and women who put their lives at risk and the Special Forces I ordered to get bin Laden and are now on the ground in Iraq and in Syria   they know full well who the enemy is. So do the intelligence and law enforcement officers who spent countless hours disrupting plots. And protecting all Americans, including politicians who tweet, and appear on cable news shows. They know what the nature of the enemy is. So there s no magic to the phrase  radical Islam.  It s a political talking point. Clearly, Obama was taking aim squarely at Donald Trump without even saying his name by talking about  politicians who tweet. But President Obama had more strong words to say to Republicans and Trump on the subject of discriminating against all Muslim for the actions of one in Orlando. We are now seeing how dangerous this kind of mindset and this kind of thinking can be,  Obama said in reference to Trump s renewing his hateful call to ban all Muslims from entering the country.  We re starting to see where this kind of rhetoric and loose talk and sloppiness about who exactly we re fighting, where this can lead us. Are we going to start treating all Muslim-Americans differently? Are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance? Are we going to start discriminating them because of their faith? We ve heard these suggestions during the course of this campaign. Do Republican officials actually agree with this? Because that s not the America we want. It doesn t reflect our Democratic ideals.

But Cuomo had the perfect response to that bullshit by asking Giuliani how he would feel if people referred to mob violence as radical Italian terrorism. Calling this gay and not using that word and not running away from it because of some sense of identity politics is wrong and you agree with that,  Cuomo began. Saying  radical Islamic terror    you used an analogy, let me reverse it on you. If every time the mafia made a killing or a murder, they said  well, those Italians, well there s something about  em, and the mob. There s something about the Giuliani and the Cuomo.  How would you have felt? You would have been disgusted. It s one of the things that motivated you as a prosecutor to distinguish the mafia from the rest of the Italians. That is the same point, is it not? That you can t talk about all of Islam you talk about these perversions. Of course, Giuliani claimed that they weren t the same thing but Cuomo quickly countered,  But if you said  radical Italian murders They call themselves the Islamic State,  Giuliani said, which gave Cuomo the opening he needed to smack down the right-wing mayor for making ISIS happy. They do because they want the credit of owning the religion,  Cuomo informed Giuliani.  They want that. Why would you give them what they want? Rather than admit that he s helping ISIS in their crusade to own Islam, Giuliani quickly changed the subject to blaming President Obama for the attacks in Orlando and San Bernardino and repeating Trump s suggestion that President Obama is in league with the terrorists.Cuomo didn t buy the bullshit Giuliani was trying to sell. I think there s some politics being played with this. With Donald Trump coming out and seeming to suggest that President Obama has some sympathy, some compromise personally that doesn t keep him from being tough. With all the troops, with taking out OBL (Osama Bin Laden), I mean, it just doesn t seem like the right kind of rhetoric. I don t think if you were running you would ever suggest anything like that about a Commander in Chief. But Giuliani just continued to blame President Obama and claimed he is weak on terror, conveniently forgetting that the 9/11 attacks occurred on his own watch as NYC mayor in 2001. President Bush was also in charge on that day, yet Giuliani somehow believes that Bush was strong against terrorism despite the fact that 3,000 Americans died that day in attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that are far worse than any terrorist that has occurred before or since.Here s the video via YouTube:In addition, President Obama stated recently that the FBI has been tracking ISIS sympathizers but are unable to keep them from buying guns like Omar Mateen did because Republicans refuse to ban people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms. If Republicans had done that when President Obama asked a long time ago this shooting could have been prevented because the FBI would have been able to make sure that every time Mateen walked into a gun shop, he would be flagged as a possible threat and would have been denied the assault rifle he used in the massacre. Someone should ask Giuliani why his party wants terrorists to have guns so much.Featured Image: Screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

However, they often have very important guests and discussions on there, and if you missed Monday night s edition, boy did you miss a doozy.Of course, we all know that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump spent the whole of Monday blaming President Obama for the shooting in Orlando   even going so far as to insinuate that the President secretly endorses terrorism. That is about as appalling of a piece of innuendo anyone   much less a presumptive presidential nominee  could throw at a sitting president, but it s Donald Trump so of course he did it.Well, O Donnell s Last Word panel was having none of it, and they ripped Trump a new one. This panel just happened to include Peter Wehner, who is a Republican and a former adviser to President George H.W. Bush. Here is the transcript of that part of the conversation via Media Matters:LAWRENCE O DONNELL (HOST): Donald Trump began the day today by saying what we knew he would say, that of course the massacre in Orlando is President Obama s fault. We all knew that was coming. Donald Trump was going to find some way to blame the president, but he didn t just blame the president s policies. He said the president actually is cheering for the other side. He said the president has something else in mind when it comes to fighting terrorism, meaning that the president doesn t really want to fight terrorism because he has something else in mind. Those were his words. The suggestion that the president was really working for the other side was delivered in Trump s classic imitation of Joe McCarthy, innuendo on top of innuendo.[ ]David, we knew it was going to be President Obama s fault, but the details were interestingly crafted this time.DAVID CORN: Well we don t have details as you put it, we have innuendo. And this is just a continuation of the argument that made him a conservative favorite to begin with: birtherism. That there s something phoney and furtive and secretive and creepy about President Barack Obama. He s really a secret Muslim, secret socialist, he doesn t like America, and Trump doesn t say these things explicitly. But it s clear that the implication is that he wants the terrorism to succeed or happen. That he s not interested in stopping it, and he has this sort of a secret agenda. Wink, wink, nod, nod; this is Alex Jones stuff. It s racist, and it feeds the base and the paranoia that brought Trump to where he is. And it s just   the fact that other Republicans don t come out  I mean, Peter will   but other Republicans don t come out and call him out on this in this moment of national tragedy is equally sad.PETER WEHNER: I think it s all that Donald Trump knows. This is the way the man is. He pulls these pins on these grenades and he rolls them and then it explodes and he says, geez, what happened? I think the guy has a personality disorder. I don t think he can control himself. So I think even if it s not in his interest to engage in this kind of stuff, he would do it. Beyond that I think he does it because he is the most massively ignorant person ever to run for president and he cannot discuss public policy. So everything he s done from the day that he s gone in is to set up these debates that are on the ground of appealing to the darkest impulses of the country. That is what he relishes, and he wants to be in the gutter. The trouble is he s bringing a lot of people down there with him.Thank you, Peter Wehner, for not being one of those crazy GOPers who puts party before country and supports Trump despite the fact that an incompetent, racist jackass like that with his finger on the button would absolutely catastrophic for both the nation and world.

He was supposedly driven to commit this sick and disgusting act after seeing two men kissing, and he d allegedly pledged allegiance to ISIS less than an hour before opening fire. There may be an even darker side to this, though, and it s one that permeates our entire society, whether we want to admit it or not.Witnesses say that Mateen had been a regular at Pulse for at least three years. Ty Smith and Chris Callen, who both performed in a drag show at Pulse, remember him being escorted from the club on numerous occasions, drunk off his gourd. When they saw his picture on TV in connection with the massacre, they were floored: Both professed shock at seeing his face on TV:  It s the same guy,  said Callen, who performs under the name Kristina McLaughlin.  He s been going to this bar for at least three years. They expressed incredulity at the story being told by Mateen s father in the wake of the shooting, that the gunman had once been scandalized during a visit to Miami by the sight of men kissing each other.They say Mateen saw plenty of men kiss   and far closer to home than Miami. That s bullcrap, right there. No offence. That s straight-up crap. He s been around us,  Smith said Monday in an interview at the GLBT Community Center of Central Florida. Some of those people did a little more than (kiss) outside the bar . He was partying with the people who supposedly drove him to do this?' Another regular at Pulse, Kevin West, told the Los Angeles Times that he and Mateen messaged off and on for a year on a gay chat app. MSNBC s Chris Hayes reported on this, too:Here s what reporting we know: several people on the record saying shooter was on several gay dating apps and messaged with them  Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) June 14, 2016 several regulars at Pulse who recognized the shooter. One saying he d been coming regularly for the past 3 years.  Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) June 14, 2016And a gay classmate of the shooter in the police academy who says he used to go to gay bars w the shooter, who asked him out once.  Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) June 14, 2016It s terrifyingly possible that Mateen himself was gay, which is a very tough and painful pill to swallow in light of what he did. The idea that a gay man could sink to such evil, and perpetrate such a horrific massacre against the very community to which he should have belonged hurts. However, he was Muslim and possibly an extreme Muslim. They have values that mirror the right-wing Christian values that allow for hatred of the LGBTQ community in what s supposedly the  freest nation in the world. Eric Biesterfeld, who is a gay man himself, explained this in a Facebook post:  [I]f you wondered why we need Gay Pride, it s because Pride is the opposite of shame. If this is true, Shame over an unchangeable, harmless facet of our humanity caused so much pain that he brought 49 lives down with his own.And yes, I blame those who would use religion to cause shame in another for this act. Louis Alemayehu, who wrote the post that Biesterfeld shared, said something similar:  Some of us suspected this. Internalized oppression is deadly in so many ways. We must be nurturing and accepting of one another from an early age. Self hatred and/or denial has implications way beyond the individual, the family, the community and ultimately the world. Our interconnections are profound and immediate. They have a point. Not all hateful, bigoted homophobes are straight, cisgender people who think being LGBTQ is so gross it has no place in our society. Some are LGBTQ people who have internalized that bigotry because we have so many hate-filled homophobes who have very loud, influential mouthpieces, and who are trying to enshrine oppression of the LGBTQ community in the laws that govern our land in the name of  religious freedom. Despite that, Chris Hayes tweeted that this doesn t excuse Mateen for anything, and he s bang-on right with that. Make no mistake, there is no calling Mateen anything but what he was   a murderer: None of this would exculpate the sheer hatred, rage and evil of this murderer. Or even *explain* it in any sense. But it complicates  Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) June 14, 2016But Hayes is right that it does complicate this, because now it s a tragedy with its roots in a societal ill, and that ill is this vile idea that the LGBTQ community is wrong and dirty, that their very identities are wrong and disgusting, and that the only true way to practice a religion is to force it on others through oppression, or worse, violence.There s no way to know what was really going on in Mateen s head. His hate, whatever drove it, was so evident that it made his co-workers uncomfortable:One of Mateen s ex-coworkers at G4S security told me he complained about the man s frequent slurs attacking gays and blacks.  David Ovalle (@DavidOvalle305) June 12, 2016  He would never have more than 3 or 4 sentences without using the word n****r or queer or dike. It was always about violence.  he told me.  David Ovalle (@DavidOvalle305) June 12, 2016Mateen also dalliances at PGA Village neighborhood.  All he wanted to do was cheat on his wife. He had very little respect for women.  David Ovalle (@DavidOvalle305) June 12, 2016Whether he was driven exclusively by an extreme religious ideology that made him a bigot consumed with hate, or he was filled a self-loathing that was so powerful, and so all-consuming that it came out in a horribly violent pyroclastic eruption, the tragic result is the same.Right-wing Christians need to look in the mirror if they want to discover all the possible causes of this massacre, because when it comes to the LGBTQ community, their values are identical the values of Islam. They re just as guilty as Mateen for all those senseless deaths.Featured image via screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Yet, they want a loan for the purchase anyway. Why would a company that s as flush as Microsoft want to take on debt like that when it doesn t have to?The answer s simple   the loan equals a tax deduction for them, and the interest on the loan will lower their tax bill for years to come. Robert McIntyre, of Citizens For Tax Justice, says: It s an odd world where a company is awash in cash and chooses to make the acquisition with debts because they don t want to pay tax. That, combined with all the other ways they can game our tax system, will bring their total annual liability to rates that are far lower than the one corporate America, and Republicans, scream is too high.This particular loophole will allow Microsoft to avoid the 35 percent tax rate they d pay for repatriating cash they re holding overseas that s needed to buy LinkedIn without a loan. Exactly how much tax will they avoid paying just this year?$9 billion. And it s perfectly legal. In fact, most types of corporate tax evasion are perfectly legal.And that s just for one year. They ll avoid millions more on just this particular purchase in the years to come, in addition to all the other ways they ll avoid paying their fair share of taxes. They aren t the only ones doing this. Back in May, a study revealed that multinational corporations are avoiding paying at least $100 billion per year in taxes. That makes the tax evasion problem much worse than previously thought.Much has been made of things like corporate inversions, where corporations buy a smaller, overseas company for the purpose of shifting their headquarters out of the U.S. and thus, avoid our taxes. We also make a big deal about tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, although we re starting to make headway with banks in countries that serve as tax shelters to put a stop to this type of evasion.But using loans when they re flush with cash is yet another tax evasion method. One might say that people with student loans and home mortgages are doing the same thing. However, people with those two particular types of debt are a) individuals, and b) aren t awash in the kind of cash a company like Microsoft is. So there s a huge difference there.Our official corporate tax rate might be 39.1 percent, and Republicans and our poor, downtrodden multinationals can whine about how high it is all they want. Their crying doesn t change the fact that, each year from 2006 to 2012, more than 60 percent of our corporations paid zero in federal income taxes. You can bet all the benefits they get from loans, like Microsoft is doing, contribute heavily to that. There is nothing that justifies their whining.Think this is just good business? Sure. From a purely profit-oriented perspective, anything that lowers costs is good because it raises the bottom line. There are real-world consequences though, and one of them is a country, like ours, that shifts its tax burden onto individuals who work, and work, and work for these very corporations, and can t bring in enough revenue to actually function properly.Microsoft will buy LinkedIn however it wants. But this, right here, is a perfect example of why our tax code needs to be overhauled. There s no reason at all Microsoft should be able to get a loan and deduct it from its taxes when it has four times the cash it needs to buy LinkedIn.

Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 13, 2016Okay, first, what gay person would be her friend? And before you get offended in any regard to that question (you know who you are) I m a lesbian and find Coulter repulsive on every level. Which leads to the bigger question  what person, in general, would be her friend?During his speech, Trump of course spent time doubling-down on his racist and Islamophobic remarks that Muslims should be banned from immigrating to the United States.Does Coulter (and Trump) not even recognize the fact that the shooter (whose name I ll never mention, because that s what he wanted) was actually born in the United States, and was able to access his arsenal of weaponry and ammunition because of Florida s, and the United States, lax gun laws? Just like almost every shooter before him, and the only way to truly combat this sort of issue is to try to prevent them from happening in the first place.You can t always change a mindset, but you sure as hell can try to prevent a potential terrorist from owning a gun.The thing is, this is just Ann Coulter being Ann Coulter. She s a bigot and she s proud to be a bigot, and she doesn t care if you think she s a bigot. She s an isolationist who seems to think white people should reign supreme.It s just amusing to think that she wants us to believe she has gay friends. If, however, she really does have gay friends, they should probably realize they re friends with a bigot.Featured Photo by Frederick M.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""On Monday, Donald Trump accused the President of the United States of being an ISIS sympathizer and when the Washington Post reported on it, he threw a tantrum that culminated in his taking the unprecedented step of banning one of the biggest newspapers in the country from having access to his campaign. To put that in its proper context, during the height of the Watergate scandal, an event begun by two Washington Post reporters, President Richard Nixon didn t even try to pull press credentials. It was literally unthinkable.On Facebook, Trump went on a rant about how unfair the Washington Post was being for accurately quoting him.I am no fan of President Obama, but to show you how dishonest the phony Washington Post is, they wrote,  Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting  as their headline. Sad!Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post.To be clear, Trump is   as is often the case   openly and unapologetically lying. Earlier in the day, he went on Fox News and remarked that the reason Obama can t stop terror attacks in the United States is because he doesn t want to. We re led by a man who is a very   look, we re led by a man that either is, is not tough, not smart, or he s got something else in mind. And the something else in mind, you know, people can t believe it. People cannot   they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the ways he acts and can t even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There s something going on. It s inconceivable. And when reporters asked him to clarify, he refused, and cryptically added that he would let people decide for themselves what he meant. Trump  who has been on record for years as being a birther  knows what conclusions his fans will draw. Why rock the boat by turning that particular dog whistle into a bull horn?By one count, Trump has banned at least seven media outlets from covering his campaign due to unflattering treatment. (This doesn t include the news programs or journalists whom Trump simply refuses to talk to because of personal beefs.)We count at least 7 outlets Trump has barred from events Nat Review, Daily Beast, HuffPo, Buzzfeed, WaPo, Politico, DMR, who else?  Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) June 13, 2016A few more: Mother Jones and Univision. There are likely others. There will likely be more soon.So when the Washington Post was added to the list, the paper s editor Marty Baron released a scathing statement calling Trump on his fascistic view towards the free press. Donald Trump s decision to revoke The Washington Post s press credentials is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press. When coverage doesn t correspond to what the candidate wants it to be, then a news organization is banished. The Post will continue to cover Donald Trump as it has all along honorably, honestly, accurately, energetically, and unflinchingly. We re proud of our coverage, and we re going to keep at it. In short, don t expect the Washington Post to just roll over. They are going to continue to go after Trump wherever and whenever he tries to pull a fast one on the American people.Trump has also flirted with the idea of getting rid of the free press altogether once he is president. On at least one occasion Trump told his supporters that he would open up libel laws and viciously and aggressively sue any media outlet that tries to criticize him. With such a fundamental danger to America s First Amendment, only one news network embraced Trump s moves towards tyranny: His friends at Fox.Stuart Varney on Fox Business calls @washingtonpost reporters looking into Trump \""henchmen\"" of Jeff Bezos. pic.twitter.com/F8CxcNeOZn  John Whitehouse (@existentialfish) May 12, 2016They must assume they re safe.

These misdemeanors include low-level assaults, threats, harassment and property damage.In a statement released on his website, Casey described his bill as  common sense,  saying:If you have proven you will commit criminal acts based on hate, you absolutely should not have access to a gun. It s common sense. It is time we as members of Congress do something. If you are a member of Congress and you say you care about security then you have to take steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands and ensure our law enforcement has the resources needed to keep communities safe.Casey s office also reminded the public that, according to National Crime Victimization Survey data, about 259,000 hate crimes happen each year in the United States, and that between the years of 2010 and 2014 alone, more than 43,000 hate crimes were committed with a firearm.These are the people who should not have access to guns, period.The same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in February by Democrat David Cicilline of Rhode Island. It is currently being held up in committee, and GovTrack gives the bill less than a 2 percent chance of being enacted. A simple bill, like Casey s, would prevent the sale, disposition, possession, shipment or transportation of a firearm based on an  enhanced hate crime misdemeanor sentence. Let s sit back and see how Republicans try to worm their way out of this no-brainer piece of legislation. They did it with background checks at gun shows and stopping terrorists from getting guns, so who knows how they ll respond to this one.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Even though he was on the government s radar, he was able to purchase his weapons legally just days before he killed 50 people and wounded 53 others.Some Americans are just now learning, for the first time, that individuals on watchlists (or who are being monitored by the FBI) can legally buy a gun, no problem, and they cannot be stopped. This is also known as the  Terror Gap,  and like the Charleston Loophole (which allowed Dylann Roof his gun used to kill nine black churchgoers), it exposes fatal cracks in our system.But just 10 days before the Orlando shooting, President Obama warned the people that this fatal crack was detrimental to our national security, and no one paid attention.When asked by a gun owner at a PBS News Hour discussion why he wants to  control and restrict and limit gun manufacturers, gun owners and responsible use of guns and ammunition to the rest of us, the good guys,  and not the bad guys, President Obama responded with:What I have said is precisely what you suggested, which is, why don t we treat this like every other thing that we use? I just came from a meeting today in the Situation Room in which I got people who we know have been on ISIL Web sites, living here in the United States, U.S. citizens, and we re allowed to put them on the no-fly list when it comes to airlines, but because of the National Rifle Association, I cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun.This is somebody who is a known ISIL sympathizer. And if he wants to walk in to a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as much   as many weapons and ammo as he can, nothing s prohibiting him from doing that, even though the FBI knows who that person is.And 10 days later, an ISIL sympathizer walked into a nightclub with his legally bought guns and unleashed the worst shooting in American history.In December, a simple bill in the Senate was shot down by Republican lawmakers. It s purpose? Anyone who appears on watchlists or is being flagged by the government as a terrorist sympathizer may not purchase gun. Every Republican (and one Democrat) voted no. Republicans are so beholden to the NRA that they couldn t even ban potential terrorists from having access to weapons.So the next time Republicans want to blame President Obama, remind them that  he tried to warn us, and that our Republican Senate has blood on their hands.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

You know, because not just any idiot can predict that an attack of some kind will happen in the future.But on Monday morning during an interview on Fox & Friends, Trump crossed the line by actually suggesting that President Obama is not doing anything to fight terrorism and may be aiding the terrorists.

Despite what Trump says, Obama has been fighting ISIS for a long time now even as Republicans in Congress refuse to declare war on the terrorist organization they paved the way for in the first place by invading Iraq back during the Bush Administration. Claiming that President Obama is in league with the terrorists is just absurd and outrageous.Airstrikes killed a top ISIS leader in March, which was only the second such strike to take out a member of ISIS that month. A strike also took out an ISIS commander in Iraq in January and yet another strike killed an ISIS leader in Libya last November.And that s only four of the many such airstrikes that have dealt major blows to ISIS and their operations.But according to Trump, President Obama only has to say three words and ISIS will somehow magically disappear off the face of the planet, thus demonstrating once again that Trump is completely unqualified to be president. Because while he is congratulating himself for a prediction that any three-year-old could make and running his mouth about what President Obama should say to defeat ISIS, our commander-in-chief has been taking action. If Trump really wants to blame someone for not being hard on ISIS he should blame the Republicans in Congress for not exercising their power to declare war.

Over a period of several hours the gunman killed 5o people. Another 53 people were injured during the killing spree.According to police sources, shortly before the attack began, Mateen dialed 911 and pledged his support to the terrorist organization ISIS.Although Mateen was born in the United States, his parents are immigrants who came to the US from Afghanistan. As the Washington Post reports, Mateen s father hosts a political talk show, called the Durand Jirga Show. The title refers to a disputed strip of land between the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan.In at least one video, Seddique Mateen, father of the shooter, is seen praising the Taliban, saying: Our brothers in Waziristan, our warrior brothers in [the] Taliban movement and national Afghan Taliban are rising up. Inshallah the Durand Line issue will be solved soon. According to the Palm Beach Post, Mateen has been known to the FBI for several years. In 2015, the FBI investigated the connection between Mateen and Moner Abu-Salha, a one time resident of Vero Beach, Florida. Abu-Salha was the first American suicide bomber in Syria.Like most religious extremists, Abu-Salha vehemently hated gay people and promoted videos on Facebook calling for their execution.In one video posted to Abu-Salha s Facebook page, the group s religious leader is seen telling a gay man that he would be considered  a murtad or apostate,  who would be cast  out of the fold of Islam.  He goes on to say,  You will not be buried in a Muslim graveyard. No Muslim person would ever read your funeral prayer.  He goes on to say that  Homosexuality is punishable by death. Watch the video below:As the Christian right frantically works to portray the mass shooting at Orlando s Pulse Nightclub as a reason to hate and ban Muslims from America, the similarities between Christian extremists and the Taliban are more apparent than ever.Here in the US, right-wing preachers routinely call for the executions of members of the LGBTQ community. In the meantime, Republican extremists in government work hard to make sure that every crazed, violent, potential mass murderer has access to the weapons they need to carry out such a vicious hate crime.The Pulse Nightclub mass shooting was carried out by a Muslim extremist who targeted the gay community in a violent religious frenzy.It doesn t matter whether a gun-toting religious fanatic is carrying a Christian Bible or a Muslim Koran.

He went on to acknowledge the impact the shooting has had on Florida s LGBT community, saying: There are a lot of members of that community and supporting friends and family who are very worried.

He again asked Scott about the precautions his administration is taking to protect members of the gay community, and specifically asked whether there would be additional law enforcement presence to protect against possible copycat attacks or on the off chance that the shooter wasn t acting alone.While it seems clear from the interview that Tapper was hoping to get Scott to reach out to members of the LGBT community in his own state following the deadliest mass shooting in history, Scott never did that.Instead he offered more generic assurances about how the state responds  when something like this happens.  Scott said,  one of the first things you do on top of dealing with the issue you have at hand, is say,  Who else could this impact and what can we do to make sure that does not happen?

More than 50 others would not have been injured by bullets that came from one or more guns. The simple fact that more than 100 people were shot by a lone gunman is proof that the zone in and around Pulse was not  gun free. The fact of the matter is that we can never really have a  gun-free zone  unless some kind of enforcement exists to make sure that guns are kept out.

The  Christian  pastor praised the shooter for eliminating his victims because they we  just disgusting homosexuals at a gay bar.  While he says he would never advocate violence (except for the time he prayed that President Obama would  die and go to hell and his statement that all gay people should be murdered, of course), Anderson is clear that the Muslim man who killed all those people was simply following the Bible (what?):Now let me just be real clear: I ve never advocated for violence. I don t believe in, you know, taking the law into our own hands. I would never go in and shoot up a gay bar   so-called. I don t believe it s right for us to just be a vigilante  But I will say this: The Bible says that homosexuals should be put to death, in Leviticus 20:13. Obviously, it s not right for somebody to just, you know, shoot up the place, because that s not going through the proper channels. But these people all should have been killed, anyway, but they should have been killed through the proper channels, as in they should have been executed by a righteous government that would have tried them, convicted them, and saw them executed. Because, in Leviticus 20:13, God s perfect law, he put the death penalty on murder, and he also put the death penalty on homosexuality. That s what the Bible says, plain and simple.While he is happy that fifty people were murdered in the name of his god (though many Christians would dispute that they share a god with Muslims) after an extremist saw two men kissing and flew off the rails, Anderson says that there are some drawbacks   like those awful liberals who think that this attack is one of the many examples that we need reasonable firearm regulations, and those who will denounce hate speech:But the bad news is that this is now gonna be used, I m sure, to push for gun control, where, you know, law-abiding normal Americans are not gonna be allowed to have guns for self-defense. And then I m sure it s also gonna be used to push an agenda against so-called  hate speech.  So Bible-believing Christian preachers who preach what the Bible actually says about homosexuality   that it s vile, that it s disgusting, that they re reprobates   you know, we re gonna be blamed.Like,  It s all extremism! It s not just the Muslims, it s the Christians!  I m sure that that s coming. I m sure that people are gonna start attacking, you know, Bible-believing Christians now, because of what this guy did. I m not sad about it, I m not gonna cry about it. Because these 50 people in a gay bar that got shot up, they were gonna die of AIDS, and syphilis, and whatever else. They were all gonna die early, anyway, because homosexuals have a 20-year shorter life-span than normal people, anyway,  Anderson says.

Who else hates the LGBT community?If #omarmateen was motivated by radical Islam, his hatred of LGBTQ people is consistent with US religious right and  religious freedom  laws  Captain Renault (@JohnMonch) June 12, 2016BOOM! That s right, our own right-wing Christians hate the LGBT community. Of course, they cover their hatred and bigotry with pretty, all-American phrases like  religious freedom,  and  the First Amendment,  but they re motivated by the same hate that motivated Mateen.Take a look at North Carolina s anti-LGBT law, which requires people to use the restrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificate. State representative Dan Bishop, the primary sponsor of that law, compared LGBT-equality advocates to the Taliban as justification for that law. He also damned the LGBT community itself as a major threat to freedom.His constituents support and spread these dangerous ideas, and he gave them their mouthpiece when he authored that law.Ted Cruz, who rose to prominence as the primary architect of GOP obstruction in the Senate, and solidified his reputation as a hard-right Christian bigot while running for president, has also spewed hate about the LGBT community. He wants to reverse the Supreme Court s marriage equality decision, and he flat-out lies about the  threat  that transgender women pose to little girls in public restrooms when he voices his support of these idiotic bathroom laws.While Mateen was very likely not influenced by these people, he was influenced by ISIS  hatred of the LGBT community. Yet the attitude is the same   Islam and Christianity both consider homosexuality to be a sin. Both have their radical sects that twist these things into something vile and sadistic that they then use to justify hate crimes and terrorism against the LGBT community.For right-wing Christians to condemn anybody for this shooting, when they themselves spout the same baloney that causes that very hate, is hypocritical at best. Before pointing the finger at radical Islam, they need to take a good, long look in their mirrors, and remove the logs from their own eyes first.Featured image via MySpace and Twitter""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Howell was also in possession of a five-gallon bucket containing the explosive Tannerite. Tannerite is commonly used for making pipe bombs.Howell initially told police he was waiting for a friend.

Never one to let a tragedy get in the way of self-glorification, Trump has come across as cold-hearted, moronic, and narcissistic   often all at the same time. Now he can add  fake  to the list as well.In the early moments after the attack, Trump began by sending out a vague reaction to the attack claiming he was thinking of the victims, only to follow it up with a random, unrelated smear directed at Hillary Clinton. Since then, he s released a torrent of anti-Muslim bigotry. He s congratulated himself for being  right  about Muslims. He never once mentioned the heartbreaking fact that the attack was in an iconic gay night club and most of the victims were LGBTQ. Nor has he mentioned that this appears to be as much an anti-gay hate crime as an Islamic terror attack.Oh and he also stole a reporter s tweet and passed it off as his own so as to not have to share the spotlight with someone else even for one second.CNN s Brian Stelter caught him red handed.It looks like Trump flagrantly copy & pasted @SebGorka's unsourced 2:03pm tweet, tweaked it, and posted at 2:52pm pic.twitter.com/aAHWUHvvnH  Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) June 12, 2016As is immediately clear, Trump  flagrantly copy and pasted  reporter Sebastian Gorka s tweet and made it his own. Why didn t he just retweet Gorka if he wanted to pass along the information? Because then he wouldn t get the retweets and likes that he so desperately craves.Throughout the day, Trump has put on a master class in how not to handle a national tragedy. He s made the event exclusively about himself. To contrast Trump s ego, both President Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton have released statements that honor the victims, condemn the attacks, and demonstrate a sensitivity to the startling acts of terror. In particular, Obama took pains to not lose sight of the victims and their identity   something Trump has yet to even mention.This is an especially heartbreaking day for all of our friends, our fellow Americans, who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. The shooter targeted a night club where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live. The place where they were attacked is more than a night club, it is a place of solidarity and empowerment, where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights. So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation, is an attack on all of us, and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as as country.Compare that to how President Trump would react:Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance.

Absolutely, it s horrific,  he replied before launching into a story about how an administration official allegedly approached him a police training session and told him that the real threat to America is white supremacists.If the story is true, the administration official was not wrong.According to the New York Times:Since Sept. 11, 2001, nearly twice as many people have been killed by white supremacists, anti-government fanatics and other non-Muslim extremists than by radical Muslims.And law enforcement agrees.A survey to be published this week asked 382 police and sheriff s departments nationwide to rank the three biggest threats from violent extremism in their jurisdiction. About 74 percent listed anti-government violence, while 39 percent listed  Al Qaeda-inspired  violence.Sounds like Fox News needs a new expert, especially since this latest mass shooting has not been concluded to have been an act of terrorism linked to radical Muslims.And while Fox was quick to call this shooting an act of terrorism simply because the shooter has brown skin and the name of Omar Mateen, they refused to call the Charleston mass shooting an act of terror because the shooter was a white supremacist.Clearly, Fox News is still practicing a double standard where right-wing terrorists are treated with kid gloves while anyone with brown skin is immediately labeled a terrorist. Make no mistake, what happened in Orlando is an act of terrorism, but so are mass shootings by white gunmen and it s time for conservative media to stop the bullshit.Also, President Obama is NOT to blame for this shootings. The only person to blame is the asshole who pulled the trigger and our lax gun laws that make it so easy for anyone to get their hands on a gun.But Fox News still wasn t done. They brought Newt Gingrich on the show and he wasted no time demonizing the entire religion of Islam and pinned the blame on President Obama for the shooting. The Obama administration had deliberately and willfully for seven years tried to avoid telling the American people the truth about an ideology which is an enormous threat to our civilization and which is winning the war.

Warren s report showed that financial advisors were personally profiting from giving bad advice to people seeking retirement investment information.As Addicting Info reported here, financial advisers were being rewarded with all-expenses-paid, luxury vacations to places like South Africa, the Bahamas and Aruba, as well as golf outings, theater tickets, gift cards and cash prizes, all for steering retirees toward risky, company-owned investment options.A loophole in federal law made it legal for financial advisors to knowingly give people who turned to them for advice on retirement investments bad information.President Obama directed the Department of Labor to close the loophole, a move which outraged Wall Street firms and their Republican representatives in Congress.On April 19, republicans introduced legislation that would have overturned the newly revised rule.The legislation, H.J.Res.88, passed the House by a party-line vote of 234-183. It passed the Senate 56-41, with three democrats voting in support, Joe Donnelly of Illinois, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana.The legislation made its way to the president, who promptly vetoed it on Wednesday.In his veto message to Congress, the president wrote: The Department of Labor s final rule will ensure that American workers and retirees receive retirement advice that is in their best interest, better enabling them to protect and grow their savings. It is essential that these critical protections go into effect.

After all, he s made tons of money, right? That makes him such a brilliantly successful businessman, and he s so smart that he can translate that enormous fount of skill and knowledge into politics, and  make America great again. What he doesn t talk about are his many failures, and how he turned those failures into money for himself, even while his employees suffered, Atlantic City suffered, and his investors suffered. What did he suffer? Oh, that s right, the stigma of fleecing, which isn t a stigma at all as far as he s concerned.How did he do it? He put up very little money of his own, shifted his personal debt over onto his casinos, and let the consequences of his failures fall onto his investors, who had bet that he was actually a good businessman. While all that was going on, he sat back and collected millions in salaries, bonuses and other payments.As a result, his casinos suffered from too much debt and too little revenue. He borrowed money for them at such ridiculously high interest rates that there was almost no chance his casinos could ever succeed. He did this after telling regulators he wouldn t, too. He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy four times, and then continued with the expensive loans.In fact, he filed for bankruptcy on the Trump Taj Mahal twice, and Trump Plaza Casinos once. He then reorganized into Trump Entertainment Resorts, Inc., which ended up with $1.8 billion in debt (yes, that s with a  b ), and then he filed bankruptcy there, too. Each time, he convinced his bondholders to accept much less money while he continued to pile on the debt.He also took money out of his casinos in Atlantic City to invest in his Manhattan properties, and then from his smaller Atlantic City properties to try and prop up the Taj Mahal. He called Atlantic City a  very good cash cow for me for a long time.  The lesson he learned from all that? Don t leave yourself on the hook for loans. So he shifts debt to everywhere else he can to avoid having to pay for it himself.In other words, he s a diamond-level master manipulator. Nobody without his skill at manipulation could have walked away from that many failures with millions in their pockets.His casinos aren t his only failed businesses though. He also has:That s a hefty list of businesses at which he s tried and failed. His casinos are probably the worst, though, because they had the biggest negative impact. The impact was made worse by a weak-kneed board that allowed him to rake in his own dough even though his casinos couldn t draw in enough people to create a sufficient revenue stream, let alone deal with the debt they were carrying.When Trump left Atlantic City, many people were happy to see him go not just because he was a blemish on their industry and city, but also because he failed to pay contractors and other workers for the work they did on his casinos. That s so sadly typical of Trump.As president, his business acumen would be his greatest liability, not his greatest asset. All he knows is manipulation in favor of himself. He doesn t actually know how to do anything real, as this demonstrates.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

For example, I typed in the words,  Hillary Clinton  in Google, and below the paid content and the standard things on top, like Wikipedia, there s a whole lot of negative stuff:Those are the listings on page one. Going deeper into the searches brings up a lot more negative than positive.Unfortunately, my experiment isn t any more scientific than SourceFed s, but others know more and they say that it s SourceFed that was manipulating the search results, not Google. Google, which should surprise few, has a more sophisticated search engine than either Bing or Yahoo. They do sort of manipulate searches, but not to influence public opinion. They don t include unfounded negative listings in their autocomplete options, no matter how many people are searching those rumors.

He sees Hillary Clinton as a criminal, and Donald Trump as a liberal in conservatives  clothing. To him, if there was ever an election where the choice was between two true evils, this is it. He s got a solution to the problem though: Elect a robot to be president this year.No, really, he did say that. Gutfeld would nominate IBM s Watson supercomputer for president if he could. He said: The fact is, every single bad decision in life is an emotional one, in which feelings, insecurity and ego overcome our rational brain. So is every single good decision. That s the first spot where he shows off how little he understands this. Another spot is where he talked about how robots won t engage in discrimination: Another plus that eliminates the hazards of sex differences: no disputes over temperature. Studies have shown that women prefer a room warmer than men   roughly 77 degrees to 72. The difference in preference may be due to the lower average skin temperature for women, so they start out already feeling chilly. By eliminating the male/female conflict over the thermostat, we cut down on workplace animosity and  gender-discriminating bias in thermal-comfort predictions.' What? Just what? So people wouldn t work in the White House at all anymore. Sure.His whole line of thought is that, instead of electing a third-party candidate, who would be just as shady as he sees our two main candidates, we should put a cold, emotionless, runs-only-on-algorithms robot in the White House, and lead the free world. Here are some of the other benefits Gutfeld sees with having a robot in the White House:A robot can work nonstop, without the need for a feeding break, and its mental capacities don t diminish at all from a lack of nutrients or sleep.The second item   that there s no sexual harassment or sexism (which could also be parlayed into no more racism, ageism, etc.), is a little more tricky because that algorithm would be programmed by man. Therefore, it could still contain biases against certain demographics.The third point   that robots stick to the algorithm, depends heavily on just how sophisticated as AI beings they are. If all they do is stick to their programming, they d fail miserably as leaders. Leaders have to be able to think creatively, innovatively, and even with emotion and empathy. A robot that just sticks to its algorithms can t do that.Sure, it sounds interesting enough, but for this year (at least), that story should be marked as satire, or otherwise as a joke, because that s what this idea is right now. A joke. Watson isn t sophisticated enough to actually lead the country. It s odd that Gutfeld doesn t know that. Either that or this story is a really stupid joke put forth by a really dense Fox News contributor.Believe it or not, this idea has been floating around for some time as we work towards actually creating artificial intelligence. Zoltan Istvan, a near-totally unknown presidential candidate from a near-totally unknown party, believes that, as soon as 2020, we could see artificially intelligent robots running for president. By 2028, they ll be sophisticated enough to actually do the job.Istvan says: The reality is that AI will likely make far less errors than humans in politics. An AI president would be designed to fully represent the greater good for the people and the country as a whole. Whose influence would be heaviest, though? Republican or Democrat? Conservative or liberal? Istvan believes that we could solve some of the limits of programing, like faulty human bias and the threat of turning the world into some mix of the Terminator films and The Matrix films, by creating empathy in these robots. Empathy is needed when leading a nation, so a robot would have to have it.However, Istvan also says: There are large risks for letting AI take office. Yes, there are, especially right now, because AI is still in a fetal stage of development.Gutfeld, though, doesn t see drawbacks to this at all, because he hates both our candidates equally and very likely doesn t understand what all is involved with putting a robot in a leadership position. He doesn t get that, while yes, Watson is an amazing achievement, it s just not fit to be a leader in any capacity because it lacks the emotion and empathy needed to be a leader.Image by David R.

The slap on the wrist sentence is just one example of what seems like infinite examples of how society doesn t take sexual assault seriously enough.One of the most common ways that people contribute to this problem is by making excuses for the sexual assailant s actions. A recently released video lampoons those who try to blame the victims of sexual assault by changing the crime committed to murder.The video features two animated individuals discussing the recent murder of a man named James at a large party near their campus. Here is a snippet of how the conversation goes: What was he wearing though? What? You know how he wears all of those V-neck t-shirts? Yeah but I m just saying if you don t want to get stabbed in the neck consider wearing a turtle neck sweater or something. As ridiculous as that statement sounds, it s one that happens on a daily basis across the United States. One of the classic excuses that often come up during these conversations is that the victim of sexual assault  was asking for it  because of the clothes that they wear. Other excuses include the victim s consumption of alcohol, what they were doing at the time, and who they were doing it with.When people come at victims with these excuses, it does nothing but send a message that it is okay to sexually assault someone else. It creates a culture of acceptance of sexual violence. The victim of a crime is never to blame for the actions of the person who made them a victim.No one would ever blame a murder victim for their own murder and no one should ever blame a victim of sexual assault for their assault.You can watch the video in full below.Featured image via video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Hughley sat down Joy Reid on her MSNBC show AM Joy, and shredded the entire GOP.First, Joy Reid asked Hughley how he felt about President Barack Obama, and Hughley said: The funniest thing about Barack Obama is there are things we want him to do because he s black and he just won t do. Like we want him to go  Hey, man, that s enough?  And he does it better than like that dude who calls you a liar or some of the stuff. I think he s a decent, humane, thoughtful human being and I think we will miss him when he s gone. Then, Hughley s attentions were turned to presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and he had high praise for her as well. He called her As qualified a human being as I have ever seen run for president.  After that, Hughley endorsed the idea of Hillary Clinton having progressive firebrand Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. He said of the potential of such a ticket: This man would react to two competent well-intentioned principled women with glee. I don t see anybody   listen, everything men have, black men in particular have, we have because of women. Everything we have. Every single thing. It s their time in the sun. It s a shame two women   I mean, I m not trying to be offensive, but they seem to be braver. Who fights? Who goes back and forth on Twitter, which is such a dumb notion. But who does Trump stay away from? Elizabeth Warren. Saving the best for last, Hughley then went on to rip not only Donald Trump, but whole GOP for their racism and their endorsing a clear racist for the highest office in the land. He said: Donald Trump is a racist.He s a racist and anybody who   listen, Paul Ryan basically said that s textbook racism. So what Paul Ryan actually said is  a racist is better than a liberal.  If you say that, it s because you re not affected by racism. Everything we are, because liberals built this country, you are what you are because of liberals. Hughley then ripped Reid s MSNBC colleague Joe Scarborough, host of Morning Joe: And I was on with Joe Scarborough, and I don t agree with everything he says, but he brags about this being the  party of Lincoln.  When you ve got to keep referencing the dude on the penny, you better update your resume. Stop it. Everything you enjoy right now, everybody they like now, they hated before. They hated Martin Luther King. Now they pretend. They hated Muhammad Ali, and they didn t like him until he was shaking going up the stairs at the Olympics. They didn t start loving him until he was no longer a threat. You don t get to be a little racist, you don t get to be a little pregnant. Hughley is right. The GOP is full of racists. There s no denying it now. They are literally supporting a racist for president in a country that has one of the nastiest histories of racism ever. They d rather have an incompetent racist who is so thin-skinned he d likely start a war in a fit of crazy rage for president rather than a strong, competent, more than qualified liberal woman.

I was attracted to Muhammad Ali by how he used his vocation to inflict his worldview on the public, and it was unapologetic.

In framing the question, according to the sources, she compared Trump to past historical demagogues including Hitler and Mussolini.In responding to the question, Ryan pointed out that he s criticized Trump in the past. But, as the House Republican leader, he stressed that he had a complex job and had to lead an entire conference.So, in other words, Ryan has no principles and has to act as a sheep for the rest of the tea partiers that have invaded the House of Representatives. It s good to see one Republican expose this truth. Meanwhile, progressives have been saying this for a month now.At the same retreat, Romney told reporters that Trump would usher in  trickle-down racism  should he be elected, echoing Whitman s criticisms that his rhetoric has become over the top.For anyone who might remember, Whitman ran unsuccessfully for governor of California against incumbent Jerry Brown, spending over $140 million of her own money (the most personal money any candidate has used in American history), and lost by 13 percent. In that same election, Carly Fiorina, who would go on to challenge Trump for the GOP presidential nominee, ran and lost to Senator Barbara Boxer.So far, not one Republican has compared Trump to someone like Hitler   until now. And these comments were made in a closed door meeting with high power Republicans. Only God knows what they really say behind closed doors about their precious nominee.Leave it to Meg Whitman to say what the rest of us are thinking, and leave it to Paul Ryan to brush it off and continue being a sheep.Hey, Republicans, how s that unity coming along?Featured image via Andrew Burton""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

ABC News has their statement on the issue: USA Swimming condemns the crime and actions committed by Brock Turner, and all acts of sexual misconduct. Brock Turner is not a member of USA Swimming and, should he apply, he would not be eligible for membership,  USA Swimming spokesman Scott Leightman said in a statement obtained by ABC News today.  Had he been a member, he would have been subject to the USA Swimming Code of Conduct. USA Swimming strictly prohibits and has zero tolerance for sexual misconduct, with firm Code of Conduct policies in place, and severe penalties, including a permanent ban of membership, for those who violate the Code of Conduct.' Poor little Brock Turner. Our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for him and his ruined career. His life is so difficult now, all because the drinking and partying culture on college campuses took advantage of him he decided to rape an unconscious woman. First he got thrown out of Stanford, where he was a gifted swimmer, then he got prison time, and now this. He ll have to live a mundane life devoid of the accolades he would have gotten as an Olympic medalist.Turner has promised to work to educate students about the dangers of drinking and partying on campus because he s convinced himself that s what made him rape. His father expressed for support for that when he wrote an extraordinarily disgusting defense of his son, calling him a victim of that culture, and said it s not right that his son should suffer any more just for a mere  20 minutes of action. It s painfully obvious that neither of those two actually heard the victim as she read her own statement to the court. She detailed out the horrors of finding out she d been raped, the damage it s caused, and the ways it s changed her life for the worse. She will be dealing with this for the rest of her life. Turner s defenders are trying to shun responsibility for what he did, instead of owning up to it and trying to help her in any way they can.Even a friend of his is defending him by saying that not everyone who rapes is a rapist, which is a sorry attempt to change the definition of  rapist. Furthermore, Turner only received six months in jail, and could be out in as little as three months, because Judge Aaron Persky thought his age and his lack of a criminal record up to that point warranted a mere slap on the wrist.This is the cold-blooded fuckery of rape culture at its  finest. USA Swimming is taking a stand against rape culture, though, as did Stanford when they expelled him. His life is ruined, as well it should be, because the only way to avoid this is to respect women and not rape them. Lots of men get drunk every day and manage not to rape women, so why couldn t Turner?

Right-wing trash dispensary and ridiculously-named Facebook page, The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense, posted a question for their racist, uneducated, Trump-loving followers.

To start off the social media lynching, the conservative propagandists added the message,  I know what Id tell ANY Obama I came face to face with.

The once neutral Massachusetts Senator has now passionately endorsed Clinton to be the Democratic Party s nominee for President of the United States, and women s groups are ecstatic at the thought of a two women ticket.But what s more significant isn t that a Clinton-Warren ticket would be comprised of two women, it s that it would be comprised of two former Republicans coming together to usher in one of the most progressive party platforms this country has ever seen.Clinton, who was a Goldwater girl and a Republican until 1968, and Warren, a Republican until 1996, both had their reasons for leaving the GOP and joining the progressive movement. Clinton let over her opposition to the Vietnam War, and the party s veiled racist messages at the 1968 Republican National Convention (these veiled racist messages would later be known as the Southern Strategy).Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, who is roughly the same age as Clinton, stayed in the GOP for a lot longer, but realized (coincidentally, during the Clinton Administration) that they were nothing but a bunch of frauds suckling at the teat of big money: I was an independent. I was with the GOP for a while because I really thought that it was a party that was principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets. And I feel like the GOP party just left that. They moved to a party that said,  No, it s not about a level playing field. It s now about a field that s gotten tilted.  And they really stood up for the big financial institutions when the big financial institutions are just hammering middle class American families. I just feel like that s a party that moved way, way away. Two iconic, liberal women. Both former Republicans. Now? They may be the next President and Vice President of the United States.Compared to Warren (and indeed Sanders), Clinton is certainly the more moderate one. But that doesn t mean she isn t a progressive in her own right, fighting for the rights of women and children for decades and standing up to lobbies that want to turn back the clocks. Clinton s compassion for working families, coupled with Warren s watchdog zeal for the big banks, seems to make us forget they started with conservative backgrounds.It s interesting how that works. From humble, conservative backgrounds to being the front page news on the cusp of history   as Democrats.Some conservatives cow tow to the elites, like the so called  Reagan Democrats,  and others wake up one day, look around, and realize that the system isn t working anymore. So they become Democrats, and fight to make the country a better place.While the Democrats have (hopefully) chosen an evolved ticket, Republicans have nominated a constant flip flopper; Trump was a Democrat before 1987; Republican from 1987 to 1999; Reform from 1999 to 2001; Democrat again from 2001 to 2009; Republican again from 2009 to 2011; Independent from 2011 to 2012; and is now a Republican, again.These two ladies had what s called a natural progression. Trump? He s seen opportunities to benefit him and only him.With Warren and Clinton, America gets exactly what they see. With Trump, who knows. But what we do know is this: Clinton   Warren chose to become Democrats, and have stuck by that principle for decades. And they may very well be our next President and Vice President.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

When undocumented immigrants get sick, they don t have a lot of options. Many go to emergency rooms, where taxpayers often get stuck with the bills. This would take the burden off of taxpayers. It would also expose fewer people to contagious diseases   after all, healthcare is in the public interest. Jerry Brown knows this. I m not sure why Republicans don t.It s pretty understandable that Republicans would be upset. They ve been telling voters for years that Obama wanted to include undocumented immigrants and now they re saying that about Hillary Clinton.California s legislation might not pass federal standards.

This year, they do plan on spending about $450 million on conservative causes, but as far as supporting anything Trump does, they ve come to their senses enough to know that he s terrible for the country.Their specific problems don t just involve his policy positions (although it s hard to know just what policy positions Trump has, since he says whatever he wants), and they re angry over his comments about Judge Curiel, who s presiding over the Trump University case. Trump believes that Curiel, despite having been born in Indiana and being an American citizen, is biased against him because of his border wall idea.Charles Koch told USA Today: It s either racist or it s stereotyping. It s unacceptable, and it s taking the country in the wrong direction. He can t say whether Trump is fit to be president, but withholding the Koch empire s mostly GOP-colored money from the convention seems to answer that question for us: Koch said it would require a major shift in tone and policy for him to back Trump. Koch said he would need to be convinced that Trump supported his top causes  in a way  wasn t just hype,  ticking off as conditions: support for free trade,  free speech, eliminating  corporate welfare  and  trying to find common ground with people.' Koch doesn t believe Trump is capable of shifting on these things, though. He s probably right   Trump will not let anybody tell him he s wrong on anything. Because of that, David Koch, who attended the 2012 convention as a delegate and also contributed $1 million, isn t going at all this year.For his part, Trump is playing it off like he doesn t care, saying that he doesn t need their money. He claims he doesn t need any money at all. Yet, he s got aides that are going to meet with the Koch brothers soon. If it s not to court them as donors to help fill his rapidly emptying coffers, then what s the point?While the convention will likely be able to go on as scheduled, that s a massive blow to the party and to  King Trump,  especially when put together with all the Republicans who are  un-endorsing  Trump.

Ouch!McConnell said: He needs someone highly experienced and very knowledgeable because it s pretty obvious he doesn t know a lot about the issues. You see that in the debates in which he s participated. It s why I have argued to him publicly and privately that he ought to use a script more often there is nothing wrong with having prepared texts. McConnell has previously criticized Trump for several things, his blatant racism being just one of them. More recently, the Senate Majority Leader called Trump s controversial comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel not being fair in overseeing the fraudulent Trump University case because of his Mexican heritage  totally inappropriate.  McConnell added on the podcast: I object to a whole series of things that he s said vehemently object to them. I think all of that needs to stop. Both the shots at people he defeated in the primary and these attacks on various ethnic groups in the country. Unfortunately, despite the fact that McConnell practically admitted that he thinks Trump is an idiot and incapable of running the country, he still found it in himself to say,  I m comfortable supporting him. I m not going to speculate about what he might say, or what I might do. But I think it s pretty clear and I ve been pretty clear publicly about how I think he ought to change direction and I hope that s what we are going to see.For all of his obvious shortcomings, Donald Trump is certainly a different direction, and I think if he is in the White House he ll have to respond to the right-of-center world which elected him, and the things that we believe in. So I m comfortable supporting him. They may be on different sides of the political spectrum, but Trump s incompetency is something that McConnell and our President can actually agree on. McConnell s comments about Trump not knowing anything about the issues that America s commander-in-chief would face is something that Obama has previously said about the business mogul.At a nuclear summit in Washington D.C., Obama called out Trump s ignorance on nuclear proliferation and global politics.

There was some ammunition to that argument. Bernie was doing better in a lot of polls. Now, Hillary supporters have argued that Bernie hasn t yet had full media scrutiny, but new polls show that that doesn t even matter. Hillary is doing just fine on her own.A new Reuters/Ipso poll shows that Hillary s lead over Trump is quite comfortable and way outside the margin of error. According to the poll, she will beat Trump by about eight points.Rasmussen is showing a tighter race, with only a four point lead, but still, a lead. Even Fox News shows a three point lead for Hillary.More significant, though, is what s happening, or not happening with Donald Trump. First off, the Bernie or Bust crowd doesn t seem to be as big a factor as many feared. Only 17 percent of voters say they wouldn t vote or that they will vote for someone else. You can chalk that trend up to Trump disillusionment at least as much as Clinton disillusionment.While Hillary s approval ratings are going up, Trump s are going down, and now, we re seeing a serious crack in his campaign. We know that Trump is losing badly with women and every minority, but he s also not doing as well with white people as he needs.FiveThirtyEight argues that Trump could win, if he brings in enough white voters, but he s not doing that:Trump has trailed Hillary Clinton in every national poll for roughly the last three weeks. He s led in only three of 34 polls since knocking Ted Cruz and John Kasich from the race in early May. In fact, the only two pollsters who had Trump ahead and have released a more recent poll (Fox News and Rasmussen Reports) now show him trailing by 3 and 4 percentage points, respectively.One big reason Trump is trailing   by an average of 4 to 6 percentage points, depending on which aggregator you use   is because, despite all the bluster, he isn t doing any better than Romney did among white voters. According to Cohn s estimate, based on pre-election surveys, Romney beat President Obama by 17 percentage points among white voters. To win, Trump would need to improve on Romney s margin by a minimum of 5 percentage points if the electorate looked exactly the same as it did in 2012 and every other racial group voted in the same manner as it did in 2012.The column goes on to say that Trump is doing better than Romney in what Trump would call  the poorly educated,  but he s doing much worse than Romney with college educated white people. Without women and minorities, that leaves Trump in a losing situation. Then, of course, there are the white people who aren t bigots.Featured image via Getty Images.

Hughley did not hold back during the interview, where the he told the show s host Joe Scarborough his opinion of Trump. Hughley flat out told Scarborough that he thinks the presidential candidate is a racist: I think he s a racist. You can t equivocate. If I m in a car, and somebody I m with commits a crime, I can t make a reasonable argument that I didn t know. Hughley continued, saying: And I think you can t be a little bit pregnant, and I don t think you can be a little bit racist. That is the absolute truth. Of course, there are different ways that people can be racist. Seeing as the United States is a racist society, everyone grows up with racism shaping their perspective of the world, causing unconscious biases to emerge in themselves. Those biases are easy for racists like Trump to exploit for their own political gain. That might partly explain why Trump supporters will swear that they do not at all support racism, yet back a candidate who is blatantly using racism to further his agenda.Well, except for the various leaders in the white supremacist organizations who back the candidate. They know that Trump is a racist and feel he is the best one to spread hatred and intolerance across the nation. Across the nation, there have examples of the racist rhetoric that Trump uses influencing children who bully other children.You can watch the full segment below in full.Featured image via video screenshot""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

It s an insane mix of Bible thumping and shameless religious pandering. (ex. Donald Trump, no one s definition of a Christian poster boy, gets to be a featured speaker.) It also includes guys like Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), who led a room full of Christians in prayer   for President Obama to die.According to reporter Betsy Woodruff, Perdue told the crowd that he had a specific prayer in mind for Obama and one they should all help him with: Psalm s 109:8. He quoted from the top with  Let his days be few; and let another take his office.  The rest of the verse s basic premise is for the subject to die quickly and for his family to live out their days in misery. It s not exactly the stuff Jesus talked about.Let his days be few; and let another take his office.Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.It s worth noting that Perdue, a relative newcomer from Georgia, is not considered a  fringe  right-winger. He s often identified as a moderate. The fact that even the  level-headed  members of the GOP will stand up before a room full of people and pray for Obama s death says a lot about just how far right the Republican Party has shifted. He may look  moderate  compared to Donald Trump, but that s a pretty low bar.Fortunately, we know that Republicans have been beseeching God to assassinate Obama since the day he took office and it doesn t look like those prayers are going to be answered. However, many of Perdue s fans might get it in their head that the will of God flows through them, and that makes this kind of violent rhetoric extremely dangerous. Perdue may think he s delivering a harmless prayer meant to pander to his base, but he should probably account for the fact that many of his supporters are crazy enough to believe it   even if he doesn t.Asking God to kill a man and leave his family destitute because you don t like his views on healthcare and taxes is truly craven. It s a stark reminder of just how warped the Fox News crowd has become in their blind rage towards Obama and Democrats. It s not wonder President Obama has basically given up on ever trying to compromise with them. When one side comes to the bargaining table with dust on his knees and callouses on their hands from praying too hard for the other side s death, there is only so far a deal can go.The entire country needs to shame Sen.

Both were on full display on Thursday s edition of Jimmy Fallon s The Tonight Show, and the target of said wit and humor was GOP presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump. First, Fallon asked Obama his opinion on how the GOP felt about Trump being their nominee, and he said that the Democrats are happy about it, for sure. Then on a more serious note, the president went on to say: The truth is, actually I am worried about the Republican Party. I know that sounds   you know what it sounds like.The main role I m going to be playing in this process is to remind the American people that this is a serious job. This is not reality TV. Then the mockery resumed, this time aimed at the astoundingly stupid Republicans sitting in Congress who have made Trump their standard bearer. Obama said: Thank you, Congress, for spending eight years wishing you could replace me with a Republican. Or, to put it another way, how do you like me now? After that, the president reminded America just how much he has managed to do, how far he has pushed America in all the right directions, despite constant GOP obstruction during the entire tenure of his presidency: I m proud of the many progressive steps our country has taken in recent years, both socially and environmentally. The United States has been a leader in developing clean energy to ensure the health of our planet for future generations. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, an additional 20 million Americans now have access to quality health care, and same-sex couples across the country now have a constitutional right to marry. In short, climate change is real, health care is affordable and love is love. After that, the president got serious again for a second, and reminded us all what is at stake should Donald Trump take the White House: The American people face an important decision this fall. The entire world is watching, and they look to us for stability and leadership. I know some of the candidates have been critical of my foreign policy. I don t want to name any names, but I believe it is of the utmost importance to work alongside other world leaders. That s why I signed the Iran nuclear deal. That s why we reopened diplomatic ties with Cuba. And that s why I negotiated the new trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. That is when Jimmy Fallon asked President Obama his feelings on TPP, and the Commander-in-Chief did not mince words: Yeah, you know me. Look, Jimmy, the TPP allows American businesses to sell their products both at home and abroad. The more we sell abroad, the more higher paying jobs we have here at home. It s that simple. After that, things got funny again as the segment drew to a close, where Fallon asked what Obama thought of the Trump media circus. The president took a real shot at the GOP s incessant racist attacks against him, and, of course, Trump s own racism, when asked if he had been tuning in: No, but I have been watching my new favorite show,  Orange Is Not The New Black. Once again, President Obama shows himself to be a warm, down to earth, classy and adorably hilarious human being, despite being near the end of what is arguably the most difficult presidency in the history of America. He is right about Trump, and he is right to endorse Hillary Clinton in an effort to stop Trump. Most of all, though, he has not allowed anything that has been slung his way to make him lose his humanity and his sense of humor.Well done, Mr. President!

That sizzling and popping? That s the beautiful melody of the heads of conservatives across the nation exploding in the wake of some very, very bad news (for them) delivered by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California. In a precedent-setting decision, the San Fransisco-based court ruled Thursday that gun owners do not have a constitutional right to conceal carry their weapons if they face no specific threat.The court determined that San Diego and Yolo counties did not violate the Second Amendment when they denied some applicants concealed carry licenses. In those counties, applicants must show  good cause  to be armed at all times. In other words, a woman who is being stalked by her ex-boyfriend or someone in a dangerous profession can carry their guns around because they have a legitimate need for protection. Someone who just feels like taking his gun to the grocery store, however, might want to think twice before he tucks it in his waistband. In a 52-page opinion, Judge William Fletcher wrote: Because the Second Amendment does not protect in any degree the right to carry concealed firearms in public, any prohibition or restriction a state may choose to impose on concealed carry   including the requirement of  good cause,  however defined   is necessary allowed by the Amendment,  the 9th Circuit said.Reuters notes that this ruling isn t exactly unusual:The ruling places the 9th Circuit Court in line with other U.S. appellate courts that have upheld the right of officials in the states of New York, Maryland and New Jersey to deny concealed carry applications in certain cases.Under California s concealed carry law, more than 70,000 residents or less than 1 percent of the state s population had active permits last year, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting.The U.S. Supreme Court in 2013, in the middle of a raging national debate on guns, declined to weigh in on whether firearm owners have a constitutional right to carry their weapons in concealment outside the home.This is also in line with the Supreme Court s 1897 finding that the right of the people to bear arms is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons. This decision reversed a 2014, 2-1 decision by a 9th Circuit Court panel that found California residents have an inherent right to carry concealed weapons. While this issue may seem settled, these gun owners promise to keep fighting for the right to carry their confidence around with them everywhere they roam   though they may be in for a bit of a surprise, as the Supreme Court could refuse to hear the case because other circuit courts have upheld limitations on the issuance of concealed carry permits.Featured image via ToBeRight.com""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He also thanked the Senator for bringing the issue of income inequality and big money to the forefront of the debate, something he thinks will be good for November.Thanking these two  patriots,  President Obama is calling on Democrats to get out and vote for a brighter future.With poll numbers high, and his promise to take on Trump head on, could Clinton ask for a better campaign surrogate than President Obama?Watch President Obama s endorsement here:Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

The truth is that I m worried about the Republican Party.

Republicans are split on their support for Trump, especially as he continues hurling racist attacks against the judge presiding over the Trump University lawsuit.That alone has caused many Republicans to withdraw their endorsements, while other Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan have condemned Trump s racism but still support the racist for the presidency, causing even extreme conservative publisher Erik Erickson to blast Republicans for betraying their principles by supporting Trump.This is not only a preview of what President Obama had to say on the Tonight Show, it s a preview of how we can expect President Obama to deal with Donald Trump when he finally hits the campaign trail.

On Tuesday s edition of Fox and Friends, the hosts of that silly show decided to take aim at a high school athlete who just happens to be transgender. They misgendered her and called her a boy, and also said that she was  gender bending,  and  confused.  The athlete is a track star at her high school, and instead of praising this brave young woman as they should have the hosts said that she was confusing kids who are already pretty confused in this culture.

There s a high school track athlete who was born male, identifies now as female  LAURA INGRAHAM: No.DOOCY: Competed with the girls  track team. And finished I think third at the state competition. I think we could have seen this coming. What do you make of this?INGRAHAM: Well, it s another first, right? We re all into firsts so that s a first. Then it will be the first field hockey player and pole vault star. Let me just say this, and Brian will love this story. I was in field hockey in Glastonbury, Connecticut. And at the end of the season one season we had the boys  soccer team play us. We were ranked number one in the state so the boys decided they were going to pick up sticks, the soccer team and play against us. Well, sadly for us the boys, who have never played field hockey, creamed us, okay? They killed us. We were number one in the state. They were faster. They were stronger. And they   I mean, it made me really mad, but they had better hand/eye coordination and never picked up a stick before. So is this fair to the other girls competing? I mean, I don t think it s really fair.BRIAN KILMEADE (CO-HOST): Of course it s not.INGRAHAM: And I think it s just more gender bending. This is gender bending   this is the next frontier until there s another frontier that the   you know, those who want to mix up the traditional social mores want to take us to. So it doesn t surprise me. It s not fair. Until parents make their views known, this is just going to keep getting worse.KILMEADE: Hey, Laura, in an environment where people are taking performance enhancing drugs to do better in sports you know we re going to be in the situation where, well, we d like to win our first state championship so let s let a few men   excuse me, some boys play with the girls  team and then take the controversy and also take the trophy.INGRAHAM: Hey Brian, do you think it will go the other way though? Are girls who identify as boys, are they going to be the running backs for the football   is that going to work out well? How s that going to work out? Let s go the other direction and see how successful that works out. I mean it s just, I have no   I really have  KILMEADE: I just shrug my   I don t know what to say.INGRAHAM: Well, it s only the current conversation, but remember we ll be on to the next issue and then the next and the next. This is a current litmus test. You re not a human being with real feelings and empathy unless you re cheering this on and bowing down to this new movement. Look, that s the way they want to frame it.

Laura Ingraham, I pretty much have reached my maximum in maturity. Laura. Thanks so much.This is really just too much, even for the imbeciles at Fox and Friends. They can have their opinions, sure, no matter how absolutely ignorant they may be. But attacking a private citizen, a high school student no less, on national television over her gender identity is truly beyond the pale.

Their goal is as follows:There s a lot that s been done by and for women and girls, but there s still plenty to do. Convened by the White House, this Summit will rally all of us together to celebrate what we ve achieved, and how we re going to take action moving forward. Covering key gender equality issues, we ll make a powerful difference in our collective future.The United State of Women will be an important moment for both women and girls, domestically and internationally. It will feature speakers who will both educate as well as inspire all of us to take action on June 14th and well afterThose issues include economic empowerment, health and wellness, educational opportunity, violence against women, entrepreneurship and leadership. All are areas where women are still underrepresented, even though women make up the majority of Americans.And, highlighting an important mission in Mrs. Obama s life, seminars will be held on healthy lifestyle living, from national standards to education on HIV/AIDS, to self defense and sex education. Taking part in the effort for women s reproductive health is Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood.But what makes this summit truly unique is that it truly represents all women   white, black, Asian, Hispanic, Latino, and Native American, LGBT, older, younger   the possibilities for women have no barriers. This important summit, through seminars, workshops and diverse panels, will also teach women how to use their education and talents to achieve anything they want, from STEM instruction to domestic tasks to elected office.Language barriers? No problem. Cultural differences? They welcome it. Different religions? The more the merrier. If you are a woman who seeks empowerment and change not just in America but the world, to have your voice heard, there is a spot for you at the table.Before women sign up to be a part of the movement, they ask you to sign a pledge, which states:Today, we ll change tomorrow.Starting on June 14, Mrs. Obama s summit will set a benchmark on celebrating what women have to offer this great country, and what a time for it to start   Hillary Clinton has just made history by clinching the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, the first woman to do so for a major political party.Michelle Obama and the multitudes of talented, courageous, strong women have taken it upon themselves to step up to the challenge and lead the world bye example.This country will become a better place because of their efforts.

As backlash mounts after his racist comments regarding Judge Gonzalo Curiel, GOP lawmakers from Mitch McConnell to Paul Ryan have called on the nominee to soften his rhetoric, focus on the issues, and drop the subject.Speaker Ryan referred to Trump s comments as the  textbook definition of racism.  McConnell called the comments  stupid  and requested that Trump apologize immediately.And what does Trump do? The exact opposite of everything they recommended.In an interview with the New York Times, Trump blasted fellow Republicans for being to harsh on him: Politicians are so politically correct anymore, they can t breathe. The people are tired of this political correctness when things are said that are totally fine. It is out of control. It is gridlock with their mouths. Trump also said he expects to work well with these same Republicans because he s  always gotten  what he wanted. And Trump actually thinks Ryan and McConnell s criticisms of his clearly racist sentiments are hurting the party:Mr. Trump, arms crossed tightly across his chest during lunch, was aggrieved and considered some of the Republican pushback inappropriate and unhelpful   though he did not want to address specific critics. He insisted that he is anything but a racist and, with his usual rebuttal by the numbers, stressed that voters have rewarded his outspokenness with a record haul of primary votes while Washington is held in dismal regard.He still thinks he s done nothing wrong. And what s even worse is he thinks politicians calling out his blatant racism is considered being  politically correct.  One can only imagine what doesn t constitute being politically correct in the mind of Donald Trump.What should worry the nation more? That the Republican nominee thinks he s saying the right thing, or that there are millions of people supporting him?The billionaire blowhard also told the Times that he intends to run his campaign the same way he s been conducting it over the last several months, meaning the racism and sexism will be front and center.This is a man who cannot admit he is wrong.

All things considered, it s baffling that Trump would want to be at a funeral where there will literally be thousands of Muslims. While it s not clear why Trump wants to go, Ali s family has responded to Trump s desire to attend the Muslim funeral on Thursday, and it s definitely worth sharing.Ali s family spokesmen Bob Gunnell said: Everything we re doing here was blessed by Muhammad Ali and was requested. Ali firmly believed in inclusiveness, and Gunnell said that the boxing legend would have wanted people from all different faiths to be at the service. While Gunnell couldn t confirm if Trump would actually show his face or not, he said Trump  would be welcome to attend. Saliha Shakir, a friend to Ali, said that the family knows the nasty things Trump has said about Muslims, but it wouldn t have stopped Ali from extending kindness in the face of hate. He would have wanted people to know that Islam is an inclusive religion, rather than the divisive one that Trump has portrayed it as. Shakir said: None of us care for [Trump s] rhetoric, but this is what Ali would have wanted. He would not have turned him away. This response shows a great deal of class, as Ali wasn t naive to Trump s Islamophobia. After Trump said he would ban Muslims from coming into America in response to a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, Ali spoke out about Islam and its true principles. I am a Muslim and there is nothing Islamic about killing innocent people in Paris, San Bernardino, or anywhere else in the world. True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so called Islamic Jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion. We as Muslims have to stand up to those who use Islam to advance their own personal agenda. They have alienated many from learning about Islam. True Muslims know or should know that it goes against our religion to try and force Islam on anybody. And he also brilliantly called out Trump and those who try to make Islam out to be a violent religion: Speaking as someone who has never been accused of political correctness, I believe that our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people s views on what Islam really is. Even after his death, Ali s values will live on.

Even though Clinton wouldn t need Ohio (as long as she nabs Virginia, North Carolina and Florida) to win, that hasn t stopped Republicans from already attempting to rig the election.However, their hopes of doing just that were destroyed in court, when a federal judge issued a ruling that the state s new laws restricting the collection and counting of absentee ballots and poll workers aiding voters were unconstitutional on racial grounds. Judge Algenon Marble wrote in his decision:Voter suppression tactics have not disappeared but are now merely cloaked in ostensibly race-neutral language.Judge Marble also noted that the state s decision to bar poll workers from helping minorities fill out ballots unless the voter affirmed that he or she was disabled or illiterate was in violation of the Constitution, for it established a  literacy test  on those seeking to vote:The Court agrees with Dr. Timberlake that these inequalities, rooted in historical discrimination against African-Americans, have  significant and far-reaching  effects with specific and direct consequences for voting. Because low literacy levels are also correlated with substandard education and the Court has credited Dr. Timberlake s findings that African-Americans suffer from lower educational attainment than whites in Ohio, the Court concludes that African-Americans would also suffer from higher costs associated with the five-field requirement and the prohibition on poll-worker assistance because they would face disproportionately more challenges filling out the forms.  Because African-Americans move more frequently than whites, they may be more likely to be forced to vote provisionally. They are also more likely to be homeless.  And because they are more likely to have inflexible schedules or lack access.In other words: the state of Ohio, which is run by Republicans, attempted to circumvent black voters by instilling on them an option: know how to spell or your vote doesn t matter.Republicans literally just tried to turn black people away from voting   in 2016.This is what Republicans do: they disenfranchise black voters because they know their days of white rule are coming to and end.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He does not speak for me and I will not vote for him.If one signs the pledge, they will receive a free sticker, courtesy of the Clinton campaign.As Clinton shatters the glass ceiling, Trump continues to divide the GOP, and the Democratic candidate s campaign is taking full advantage of the rift.Just yesterday, Republican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois   who faces a tough reelection battle   became the first elected member of the GOP to un-endorse Trump. On the same day, an Iowa legislator, who has served as a Republican for 18 years, announced he would be leaving the GOP due to Trump s racism.Today, failed presidential candidate and Governor Scott Walker backed away from an endorsement of Trump, saying,  It s just sad in America we have such poor choices right now.  Just two days ago, Walker expressed willingness to endorse the frontrunner.Not only does Clinton want to win, she wants an absolute blowout. There s no better way to achieve that than to reach out to Republicans and right-leaning independents who refuse to back a racist demagogue.

I disavow these comments. Claiming a person can t do the job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment. I think that should be absolutely disavowed. It s absolutely unacceptable. Trump s flagrantly racist comments aren t enough for Ryan to rescind his endorsement of Trump. Ryan offered this explanation as to why he is still supporting Trump: Do I believe that Hillary Clinton is the answer? No, I do not,  he said.  I believe that we have more common ground on the policy issues of the day and we have more likelihood of getting our policies enacted with him than we do with her. The actual article that The NY Daily News published describes the situation with a bit of apt snark, by saying,  Donald Trump is a racist, but he s our racist, the Republican speaker of the House said. The cover is emblematic of the current situation happening in Republican politics. The GOP is a party divided. Top Republican party members have consistently refused to take a firm stance on Trump s most controversial proposals. Those proposals include building a wall a border wall that isn t needed between the United States and Mexico and the laughable assertion that Mexico will pay for this mega construction project. Then there is Trump s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. A policy that is blatantly xenophobic, impossible to enforce, and will do absolutely nothing to prevent terrorism.Though, Trump s economic policies (whatever they are this week) tend to follow the trickle down economic agenda of the party of big business, which is apparently good enough for Ryan.Featured image from screenshot via Twitter""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

He received a particularly light sentence (more on that in a bit), his father thought he shouldn t have had any sentence because it was just  20 minutes of action.  Now, a friend of Turner has spoken and her (yes her) attitude is that we are being way too politically correct because well, he s in college, or something like that.Apparently, according to Turner s childhood friend, Leslie Rasmussen, a rapist isn t really a rapist when it happens on a college campus: I don t think it s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him. I am not blaming her directly for this, because that isn t right. But where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campuses isn t always because people are rapists. Then, the obligatory victim blaming: This is completely different from a woman getting kidnapped and raped as she is walking to her car in a parking lot. That is a rapist. These are not rapists. These are idiot boys and girls having too much to drink and not being aware of their surroundings and having clouded judgement. No, this was not a case of two drunk kids taking things a little too far. This was a violent sexual assault. Here s just some of it, as retold by the victim:He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don t ask, can I finger you? Usually there s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He s in the clear. Even in his story, I only said a total of three words, yes yes yes, before he had me half naked on the ground. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls down help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls down, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls down help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that s why she wore the cardigan.Clearly, calling Turner a  rapist  isn t political correctness. It s simply a fact. Brock was convicted of three felony counts. While the maximum sentence for his offenses might have been 10 years, he will likely only serve three months. As horrendously unjust as that sentence is, it s still about three months longer than 97 percent of rapists serve. That s political incorrectness if I ve ever heard it.Featured image via video screen grab. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

In the 1992 election, women let the old boy s club know exactly how it felt   they elected a Democrat for president, and they made unprecedented gains in the House and he Senate. The 1992 election was called the Year of the Woman. And it was all thanks to one woman   Hill   who stood up to the good old boys.And now that the 2016 Democratic Primary is almost over, with Hillary Clinton reaching the threshold to claim victory, women will come out of the woodwork (at an even faster pace) and enact real change.Vox contends that should Clinton win the presidency, just her mere presence in the White House will be enough to spur a growth of women running for office:Clinton s gender is the most obvious way she stands out from everyone who s held the presidency before, but people inside and outside the campaign have hesitated to argue explicitly that it matters. But it does matter. Enormously. A woman president would be   by far   the biggest, most salient, and most important example of a successful woman in American politics likely inspiring secondary and tertiary waves of women s election runs and election victories.Using analysis from political consultant Amelia Showalter, Vox shows that when women are even mentioned as potentially running for office, female involvement in the whole process increases by a percentage point. When a woman is elected as a state Attorney General, participation increases to two percent. When elected Governor, it increases to 2.36 percent. When elected Senator, it increases to 2.9 percent.Should Clinton be elected President of the United States, with the sort of name recognition she has, the amount of female participation in the process (elected and unelected) would increase astronomically. And that measure doesn t include the throngs of women Clinton will choose to fill her cabinet.Analysis also shows that when women have representation (such as the presidency) and their identity politics   abortion, equal pay, childcare   are adequately represented by women, they will cause a ripple effect that will essentially bring male legislators onto their side. As Tali Mendelberg, Christopher Karpowitz, and Nicholas Goedert show:When women are many, they are more likely to voice women s distinctive concerns about children, family, the poor and the needy. What s more, when women are more numerous and therefore more vocal on these topics, men become more vocal too, and these effects are associated with more generosity to the poor.Women, in a sense, could liberalize the country by being elected to office. How do they get elected to office? They are inspired to run. And how are they inspired to run? They see other women, like Hillary Clinton, achieve high office.It s a ripple effect that will usher in the much needed change in Washington. After all, it s been proven that women in Congress, when they are in charge, get more done in a more bipartisan fashion.Hillary Clinton is going to help continue that.Featured image via Kevin Winter""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Everyone calls them a racist. So if Donald Trump is making racist statements, you re saying he s a racist!

Given those two choices, it is important to vote for the best one to lead America forward, the one who can be trusted to continue and expand upon Trump s policies   and with Sanders almost out of the picture (please don t kill me; I voted for him), that choice is very clearly Hillary Clinton. While Democrats disagree over which of our two very qualified candidates should run against Trump, the most important thing we can do is ensure that Donald Trump doesn t make it anywhere near the White House.The next President will nominate multiple judges to the Supreme Court.

Of course, Reagan was immediately attacked by Trump s die-hard followers, who tried to argue his claim that the former President wouldn t have backed Trump if he were here today.

No one can forget that when Trump was announced as the leader in the GOP race, conservatives all across the country reacted by burning and tearing up their voter registration cards. In some cases, GOP voters left their affiliation with the party altogether.Reagan has spoken against Trump before, with the assertion that his father would not approve of the business mogul being the GOP nominee. A few months ago, during an interview with Newsmax, Reagan slammed Trump s campaign, and the Republicans who support it: My father would be appalled by what s going on with this campaign. Are you a Trump Republican, or are you a Reagan Republican? Because you cannot be both. The words of Reagan s son are particularly humorous considering that Trump has compared himself to Reagan before, when he claimed he evoke[s] the name Ronald Reagan.  Trump said on CBS s Face The Nation: Ronald Reagan was a fairly liberal Democrat, and he evolved over years and he became more and more conservative. And he was not a very conservative person, but he was pretty conservative. And he ended up being a great president.

The #NeverTrump crowd opposes Trump s campaign but can t bring themselves to support the Democratic nominee. Kristol recently tried to stir up support for writer David French to get on the ballot, and that s when Team Trump freaked out.It was enough, apparently, to spook the Trump campaign. Sources say that on Wednesday, influential supporters of the campaign, prompted by the campaign itself, began reaching out to the Republican National Committee, to Kristol, and to French attempting to quash the bid. One Trump operative reached French s wife s family in Tennessee and told them, according to French, that he was  instructed to call and deliver a message that the race would be very difficult for me.   It was a pretty big assault that really put pressure on David that this not happen,  says a source familiar with the communications.As recent stories have indicated, it is highly likely that this thuggish maneuver came directly from Trump himself at the top. He has shown an intense interest in micromanaging his campaign, while at the same time a paranoia about anyone who would oppose him (he recently speculated that his phone may be bugged).Eventually, French decided not to run, and #NeverTrump continues to flail as the Republican establishment backs Trump even with his insistence on running a racist presidential campaign.But now it is known that if someone decides to challenge Trump, especially directly from the right in a way that could hurt his already problematic campaign, he won t hesitate to reach out to their families for some old fashioned intimidation.Featured image via YouTube""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Some nominees waited hundreds of days for just a hearing, and others have waited even longer for a confirmation.And with that, one nominee, who has waited over 820 days for a confirmation, has died.The New York Times reports that Cassandra Butts, a worker in government and non profit entities, died suddenly at the age of 50 on May 24 of acute leukemia, which she did not know she had until shortly before her death. President Obama and the White House, recognizing her passion for helping others through public service, tapped her to serve as the United States ambassador to the Bahamas.Butts had worked for multiple branches of the government, including lawmakers on Capitol Hill and the White House counsel.Butts sailed through hearings in May 2014, and all seemed on track for a swift confirmation to a seemingly unimportant position, which urgently needed filling. So far, the Bahamas hasn t had a proper ambassador for 1,647 days.But, in typical Washington form, Republicans held up her nomination, not because she wasn t qualified, but because they literally hate President Obama.And it isn t fair to link all Senate Republicans to this hold up. Only two Republicans can be single handedly blamed for this: Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz.Is anyone surprised? Cruz, up in arms over the Iran nuclear deal, placed a hold on the confirmation on all State Department nominations, which of course included Butts.Cruz couldn t get his way, so naturally he unleashed a scorched earth policy on all those even remotely associated with the President.But it was Senator Tom Cotton   better known as  Tehran Tom  by progressive advocates   who proved to be a nefarious monstrosity in the whole matter. In seeking to punish the Obama Administration over a Secret Service leak of private information about a member of Congress, specifically targeted Butts and the Norwegian and Swedish ambassador nominees. After making a fool of himself, Cotton lifted the hold on the Scandinavian ambassadors. But he kept the hold on Butts.As the New York Times reports:Cotton eventually released the two other holds, but not the one on Butts. She told me that she once went to see him about it, and he explained that he knew that she was a close friend of Obama s   the two first encountered each other on a line for financial-aid forms at Harvard Law School, where they were classmates   and that blocking her was a way to inflict special pain on the presidentAnd there you have it. Because Republicans hate the President so much, they upheld a qualified, dignified, and devoted public servant from serving in a position that yields almost no political power.And now she has died, never getting the grace of a confirmation vote.That s how the Republicans have chosen to govern.

It s going to be hard to win a general election in an increasingly diverse America when your candidate is openly spewing racism.

Brazile is a black woman who is currently Vice Chair of the DNC as well as an academic and author.So when Rove decided to  joke  that Brazile should be grateful to him and the Republican Party because she isn t a slave today, it was not only insulting, it resulted in Brazile crushing Rove with historical fact. I did you a great favor bringing you into politics in the 1860 campaign and this is how you repay me?  Rove asked.  We re happy you got the right to vote but it wasn t your current party that was responsible for it. Yeah, you read that right. Rove literally took credit for the abolition movement and claimed that black people owe the Republican Party because of the end of slavery and the passage of the 15th Amendment.Of course, Republicans were liberals at that time and Democrats were the conservatives. Today, it s the opposite and Republicans dominate the South, where racism still flourishes and Confederate history is still celebrated.But Brazile fired back by pointing out that women did not have the right to vote until 1920 and black people did not have their right to vote truly protected until the Voting Right Act of 1965, which the conservative-leaning Supreme Court gutted in 2013, which has led to red states instituting voter suppression laws designed to block black people from exercising their right to vote.And then she really let Karl Rove and the Republican Party have it by blasting them for their hypocrisy and the fact that they have to reach back in time to the 1860s to find an example of something good the party has done. I don t find it strange when Karl Rove brings up Abraham Lincoln because they can t bring up anything else,  Brazile told ThinkProgress.  It s easier for them speak of Lincoln s accomplishments than what they are doing today on voting rights. They don t have a future reference. They have the past. Exactly.

It gets worse, and don t feel bad if you have trouble keeping up with his theory.This past week we saw Clinton pair the idea of President Trump with nuclear disaster, racism, Hitler, the Holocaust, and whatever else makes you tremble in fear.The only downside I can see to the new approach is that it is likely to trigger a race war in the United States. And I would be a top-ten assassination target in that scenario because once you define Trump as Hitler, you also give citizens moral permission to kill him. And obviously it would be okay to kill anyone who actively supports a genocidal dictator, including anyone who wrote about his persuasion skills in positive terms.

Here in America we are a long way from having most insurance companies even consider covering gender reassignment procedures.

Gender dysphoria is a recognized medical condition that, left untreated, can result in high levels of anxiety and depression, which can lead to suicidal thoughts. This, and so much more, is true of the many difficulties that transgender people face. They are also much more likely to be murdered than their cisgender counterparts, and this is especially true for transgender women of color.Michelle Leard, who is affiliated with the New Brunswick Transgender Health Network and UBU Atlantic, released a statement regarding the necessity of this form of healthcare: Gender-affirming surgery is a crucial part of a successful transition for many transgender people. Today s announcement will change the lives of transgender New Brunswickers who are presently facing challenging health, mental health and social situations.

The show often does surprising things well in advance of an air date so they can make the biggest impact possible, and Sunday s episode was no exception. What they did will impact 9,000 people in the U.S.So what happened? Oliver started a debt buying/collection agency in Mississippi called Central Asset Recovery Professionals, Inc., or CARP, for short. He used it to show just how easy and cheap it is to get into this business: Debt buying is a grimy business and badly needs more oversight, because as it stands any idiot can get into it. And I can prove that to you because I am an idiot and we started a debt-buying company. And it was disturbingly easy. Not long after CARP incorporated, they were offered a portfolio of medical debt worth nearly $15 million, and given the names, addresses and Social Security numbers of the 9,000 people who owed that debt: We bought it, which is absolutely terrifying because it means if I wanted to, I could legally have CARP take possession of that list and have employees start calling people, turning their lives upside down over medical debt. The portfolio cost CARP $60,0000   they got it for pennies on the dollar. That s the norm for this business.CARP didn t start sending employees after these people like a regular agency, though. Instead, Oliver and Last Week Tonight got together with a charity called RIP Medical Debt, and forgave all $15 million of it. Those 9,000 people don t have to worry about what they owe to hospitals, clinics, and individual practitioners anymore. They might not even have to worry about whether they ll have to file for bankruptcy anymore.John Oliver just wiped out the medical debt of nine thousand people. Let that sink in while you watch the entire segment, which details out just how disgusting and grisly the debt-buying business is, below:We re the only industrialized nation in the world that doesn t have some form of nationalized healthcare available to everyone, and medical debt is the number one reason people file for bankruptcy here. In fact, more than 60 percent of bankruptcies in the U.S. have to do with medical debt. It can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for one necessary procedure. Cutting-edge cancer treatments can run into the millions.In English, our system is f*cked all to hell because of profit.This move technically cost less than the famous Oprah Winfrey show where she gave her entire audience a new car, spending roughly $8 million.

Now, this guy could have been fucking with the Politico reporter, but somehow I seriously doubt it. He sounds like he s more entertained by the whole Trump Train fiasco than he is frightened. Perhaps he hasn t thought this through, because if Trump wins, we ll be entering a nuclear war in short order. We ll be alienating all of our allies along the way, with likely no way to survive the absolute catastrophe that the orange buffoon would most certainly create.Hopefully, this is the only Democrat out there who is planning to vote for Trump for the lulz, because this isn t remotely funny.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

Most Republicans have simply disavowed his comments while some have flat out called him a fraud (and of course Democrats have been saying these things since June of last year).But the most glaring critique from any official came from Democratic Representative Filemon Vela of Texas, who penned a scathing open letter to Trump. Starting out by agreeing that Mexico should do more to deter cartel violence, Vela quickly amps up his attack, saying,  Your ignorant anti-immigrant opinions, your border wall rhetoric, and your recent bigoted attack on an American jurist are just plain despicable. Pretty standard criticism. But it gets so much better. Vela beats Trump at his own purity game, and notes that his ancestry is more  American  than Trump s, and that his family weren t chicken hawks: Before you dismiss me as just another  Mexican,  let me point out that my great-great grandfather came to this country in 1857, well before your own grandfather. His grandchildren (my grandfather and his brothers) all served our country in World War I and World War II. His great-grandson, my father, served in the U.S. Army and, coincidentally, was one of the first  Mexican  federal judges ever appointed to the federal bench. But the most telling and poignant line from Vela s letter was a good, old fashioned smackdown: Mr. Trump, you re a racist and you can take your border wall and shove it up your ass. This is by far the best response to Trump from any elected official. You know they all want to say it, but finally someone had the guts to actually come out and do it.And that s exactly what Donald Trump can do. Even if he were to be elected, there is no feasible way a wall would be built on the Mexican border and be financed by the Mexican government.Vela represents Texas  34th Congressional District, which makes up Corpus Christie and Brownsville. According to Census data, 60 percent of Corpus Christie s population is of Hispanic or Latino descent. In Brownsville, a border city, the Hispanic/Latino population accounted for 93 percent of its citizens.The proud people of Hispanic and Latino heritage of Texas  34th district can take solace in knowing they are being represented by a man who speaks for them to the fullest extent. If only this country had 100 more Filemon Vela s.Featured image a screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"

According to authorities, the first shooting occurred at about 5:45 p.m. when a gunman killed a motorcyclist at a busy intersection. The suspect then drove to a Circle K gas station where he shot two people, killing one of them. Shortly after the second shooting, police spotted the murderer s car, stopped it and confronted him. The police say that the suspect  violently resist[ed] officers  and he was killed after firing at officers. Two people were found with gunshot wounds in his car, but police have not determined if they were shot by officers or the gunman.Basically, Sunday was another violent day in America. Of course, the biggest pro-gun group, the National Rifle Association, spoke out right away and condemned the shootings. They demanded to know who this shooter was and how he got a gun. They spoke out against Florida s lax laws that allow nearly everyone to buy a weapon. They demanded action and said they want to stop this from happening ever again because dammit! this is America and people should be able to drive down the road or buy a candy bar without being gunned down.Just kidding. The NRA did no such thing; instead, they responded with silence. As usual.Two innocent people are dead and the biggest gun group in the country completely ignored it. They pretended that it didn t even happen because they don t give a shit about the lives and safety of the citizens they claim to protect. They do not care that a man was riding his motorcycle on a Sunday evening and never made it home thanks to some gun nut. They do not care about the two people in the Circle K who were shot and the one who passed away from their injuries. They do not care about the thousands of other mothers, fathers, grandparents, aunts, uncles and CHILDREN who are killed every single year in this country.Instead of issuing a statement of remorse and sympathy to the loved ones of the victims, the NRA used their time to attack Hillary Clinton and journalist Katie Couric on Twitter.Oh look: @HillaryClinton won t say if the #2A guarantees an individual right https://t.co/n84mk7pJjm  NRA (@NRA) June 6, 2016 There s still time to sign up, but the clock is ticking! https://t.co/CUDLrWHQ1N#firekatie#UndertheGunpic.twitter.com/Fp7mcvfugq  NRA (@NRA) June 6, 2016That was more important than acknowledging the loss of life in Florida and it speaks volumes about their real priorities.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Since the start of Donald Trump s campaign for President of the United States, there s been a heavy amount of racism. For most sane-minded individuals, this racism was obvious and purposeful. Many have been speaking out and standing up against such a blatant disregard for those who have immigrated to the United States from Latin American countries.Through most of Trump s campaign, many of his fellow Republicans have just chosen to ignore the obvious racism, because it became clear that the Republican base of voters wanted this rhetoric as Trump s popularity rose and pushed him into the presumptive nominee spot.It would seem, however, that Trump s latest remarks surrounding the judge that is to preside over the Trump University case, is too much for even high-ranking Republicans who have backed him for the presidency. Trump doesn t believe a judge of Mexican descent should preside over his case. Not only that, he doesn t want a Muslim either. And what next? No women, gay individuals, or any people of color whatsoever?It s become obvious Trump wants a white male America and he s not even hiding it.Noticing the clear disdain for Trump s remarks by his Republican allies was the Hillary Clinton campaign, and they brilliantly put together an ad using all of their words against the presumptive nominee.It may become the most damaging ad yet, as Trump may have finally gone too far for even his own party, with Newt Gingrich, a man who has been rumored to be a potential VP for Trump, saying: This is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made. Watch the brilliant ad here:.@realdonaldtrump s bigoted comments about a Latino judge are so disgusting, even other Republicans are offended.https://t.co/3CEBq2jsDh  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 6, 2016Featured image via video screen capture""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""False""}]}"
